TEASER
EXT--SPACE
[The city-ship of Atlantis floats in space. The shield covers only the
area immediately around the central tower complex. The rest of the city
is open to the vacuum of space.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[Sheppard approaches a jumper. Inside, Zelenka works at a panel in the
forward compartment while McKay works with a panel in the rear
compartment.]
MCKAY
Okay, when I say, go ahead and try the left one.
[Sparks start to fly, making McKay wince.]
MCKAY
Oh! Geez! I said "when I say"!
ZELENKA
(innocently)
I thought you did say!
[Sheppard walks up the ramp into the jumper.]
SHEPPARD
How's it goin', boys?
MCKAY
Well, we'd be making a lot more progress if Timmy Torture over here
wasn't trying to kill me every two seconds.
ZELENKA
I'm not trying to...kill him.
SHEPPARD
So, can you make it jump into hyperspace or not?
MCKAY
Yes, I think so.
SHEPPARD
You "think" so?
MCKAY
Yes, think.
SHEPPARD
You said you could do it.
MCKAY
Correction, I said "probably" do it.
ZELENKA
Yes, he's having trouble with one of the algorithms he created
during his brush with near-ascension.
MCKAY
This is unbelievably complex physics here, all right? I mean, it
makes string theory look like non-linear dynamics.
SHEPPARD
(blankly)
Okay...
MCKAY
And even if I do get it working, there's still a thousand things
that could go terribly, terribly wrong.
SHEPPARD
I get it. It's difficult. Million-to-one odds. Blah-blah-blah.
MCKAY
(annoyed)
Was there something else that you needed, or were you here merely to
prod and belittle?
SHEPPARD
No, no. Not merely. There's another problem we need to be thinking
about. Such as, what do we do when we get there? Getting this thing
to jump into hyperspace may be the easy part. Infiltrating the city,
stealing the ZPM, and getting out, well, I-I think that's a little
dicey.
ZELENKA
To say the least.
MCKAY
I've been thinking about that.
SHEPPARD
And...?
MCKAY
And, I think that if we stand any chance of succeeding, we're gonna
need some help.
SHEPPARD
From who?
INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD
[Weir sits up in her hospital bed as Sheppard's team enters.]
SHEPPARD
Feel like taking a trip?

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--SPACE
[The city-ship continues to float in space with the limited shield.]
INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD
MCKAY
The nanites inside you? I think that if we got them in close
proximity to the human-form Replicator city, I'd be able to
manipulate them to remotely hack into the Replicator mainframe.
SHEPPARD
We'd be able to find out where the closest ZPM is and the quickest
way to get in and out.
MCKAY
Well, not only that, we'd be able to track their movement as well.
RONON
We'll know they're coming before they can even spot us.
TEYLA
Which does not eliminate the danger.
MCKAY
Oh, far from it. But...
TEYLA
But it does give us a significant edge.
WEIR
What happens if the Replicators take control of the nanites inside
me?
MCKAY
Well, they won't. I would block any attempt--
WEIR
(interrupting)
But if they do?
SHEPPARD
I ordered Rodney to write a kill switch in the nanites' code. If we
trigger the program, it'll neutralize them.
[Weir nods and takes a deep breath, shifting on the bed.]
WEIR
"Neutralize them." You mean shut them off?
MCKAY
(reluctantly)
Yes.
WEIR
And you said the nanites are all that are keeping me alive?
SHEPPARD
They are. If we shut them off, it will...kill you. But that's not
going to happen. All right? I've ordered Rodney to keep an eye on
the little bastards, make sure they behave.
TEYLA
We would not ask this of you if it was not the only chance of this
mission succeeding.
[Weir gives a small smile.]
MCKAY
She's right. If we don't get hold of a ZPM, this city and everyone
in it will--
WEIR
(determined)
When do we leave?
SHEPPARD
Right now.
[Teyla and Ronon nod to Weir and leave.]
MCKAY
(panicking)
What? Wait. No-no-no-no-no. Not right now. Look, I haven't finished
finalizing the power distrib--
SHEPPARD
(stern, interrupting)
Finalize it. We need to move.
[McKay runs out.]
SHEPPARD
You're going to be okay, Elizabeth.
WEIR
Still, I would like all of you to keep a very close eye on me. And
the first sign of any suspicious behavior, do not hesitate with that
kill switch.
SHEPPARD
Okay, but that's not going to happen--
WEIR
(stern, interrupting)
John, I mean it.
[Sheppard reluctantly nods.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard runs to catch up with Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
Hey, Teyla! Wait up.
[She pauses and waits for him.]
SHEPPARD
I'm going to need you to sit this one out.
TEYLA
John, if this mission is not successful--
SHEPPARD
Zelenka thinks he found a planet that can sustain human life. He's
fairly confident that he can get the city there in one jump.
TEYLA
Without the shields, we would be unable to land.
SHEPPARD
I know. We won't even have enough power to establish orbit. You're
going to have to do a fly-by and get everybody else in the jumper.
TEYLA
You mean, abandon the city.
SHEPPARD
Well, if it comes to that. All right, these people are going to need
a leader--somebody who can keep them alive and keep them together,
and more importantly, not let them give up hope. That's you, Teyla.
TEYLA
(shaking her head)
John--
SHEPPARD
(continuing)
Look, if I'm not back in twelve hours, give the order.
[Sheppard jogs off.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[McKay and Zelenka work on the jumper.]
MCKAY
All right. Now.
ZELENKA
(hesitantly)
Are you certain?
MCKAY
Yes.
ZELENKA
I-I only ask because the last time you were less than definitive in
your answer.
MCKAY
Radek!
ZELENKA
All right.
[Zelenka sets a control. An even humming sounds. Zelenka limps over
with his crutch while McKay looks at his computer.]
MCKAY
(pleased)
Okay.
ZELENKA
Yes?
MCKAY
I think we got it.
ZELENKA
Good, good, now, uh, now as long as we don't burn up all of the
power on the initial jump, then...
[He pauses as he sees McKay's annoyed expression.]
ZELENKA
Yes. Yes. Right. Okay. I'll leave now.
[Zelenka passes Ronon coming in while he leaves.]
RONON
You ready?
MCKAY
Yes. Look. I'm still not sure this is going to work. I mean, I've
done everything I can to...make it--
[Ronon stares at McKay impatiently and keys his radio.]
RONON
(into radio)
Sheppard, we're ready.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDORS
[Armed security personnel escort Sheppard and Weir through the halls.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Teyla stands in the center of the room. Zelenka mans a station next to
her.]
SHEPPARD
(over comm)
All right, Teyla. We're ready to launch.
TEYLA
(into comm)
Understood.
(to Zelenka)
Open the jumper bay doors.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard, Ronon, McKay, and Weir are inside. Light shines in as the
jumper bay doors open above.]
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
Remember, no wild parties while we're gone.
TEYLA
(chuckling, over comm)
We will try to restrain ourselves. Good luck.
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
All right. Here we go.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Teyla steps forward, looking concerned as the jumper leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[A puddle jumper lifts out of the central port of the city and passes
through the shield.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Rodney, you ready?
[McKay enters from the rear compartment.]
MCKAY
Did I mention that this might not work? And that we could either
drop out of hyperspace prematurely and end up stranded in the middle
of deep space or quite possibly, be vaporized the moment I touch
that--
RONON
(irritated)
Just answer the damn question!
MCKAY
Yeah, I'm ready.
SHEPPARD
Good. Sit down. Here goes.
[McKay takes his seat in the copilot's chair.]
MCKAY
Okay. Opening hyperspace window in three...two...one...
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper enters hyperspace.]
EXT--STARGATE AREA, ALIEN PLANET, DAY
[Carter and McKay step out of the active wormhole.]
LEE
Oh, my. That's...that's beautiful.
CARTER
(smiling)
Yeah, it is.
LEE
It's like Elwynn Forest.
[Carter looks at him blankly.]
LEE
Oh, nothing. It's, uh, one of the lands in Warcraft. That's a game I
play. Well, occasionally.
CARTER
(amused)
Ah.
LEE
Oh wow.
CARTER
(chuckling)
Are you going to be okay?
LEE
Yeah, yeah. It's just, I don't get to get off-world much...or ever,
hardly.
CARTER
Well, you'd better take a picture. We're not going to be here long.
LEE
Oh, right. Good idea.
[He rummages in his pockets for a camera and starts setting it up.]
CARTER
(into radio)
This is Colonel Carter calling the Apollo. Colonel Ellis, do you
read?
ELLIS
(over radio)
Five by five, Colonel.
CARTER
(into radio)
We have stepped through the 'gate and are ready for transport.
LEE
(panicking)
No, wait, wait!
[He fumbles with his camera.]
ELLIS
(over radio)
Stand by.
LEE
Wait! Ach!
[The pair are beamed away just as Lee raises his camera.]
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
[Lee and Carter beam on board the bridge just before Lee snaps the
picture of himself. He looks, and is disappointed to see he snapped the
shot too late. Ellis stands to great them.]
ELLIS
Welcome to the Pegasus Galaxy, Colonel.
CARTER
Thank you. Still no word from Atlantis?
ELLIS
Nothing.
[Carter and Lee exchange worried looks.]
ELLIS
I've been going over the specs for these modifications you're
proposing for the sensor array. You're asking for a five-fold
increase in power consumption? Plus, you want to cannibalize parts
from half a dozen other key systems including subspace
communications?
CARTER
That's correct.
ELLIS
What if they try and contact us?
CARTER
(shrugging)
If they could, they would've done it.
ELLIS
All of this is based on the assumption that they dropped out of
hyperspace early.
[Carter nods.]
LEE
We believe that's the most likely scenario.
ELLIS
All right, let's do it.
[He sits. Lee surreptitiously snaps another picture, but the flash goes
off. Carter slaps him. Lee shrugs and plays with his camera as they
leave the bridge.]
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper exits hyperspace above the Replicator planet.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
Congratulations, Rodney. Your hyperdrive worked.
MCKAY
(raising a finger)
Unfortunately, believe it or not, Zelenka was actually right. We
burned up way more power on the jump than we expected.
RONON
What are you saying, we can't get back?
MCKAY
No, no, what I'm saying is that the...actually, that's exactly what
I'm saying.
[Ronon and Sheppard sigh.]
MCKAY
I suppose once we steal the ZPM, I could utilize its power. Then I
need to make sure that I don't overload the main--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
Let's just take things one step at a time, all right? First things
first, let's worry about...getting the ZPM.
[McKay hunches over his laptop.]
MCKAY
Right.
(to Weir)
Okay, I-I'm going to try to initialize the link.
WEIR
What do you want me to do?
MCKAY
Nothing. Just sit there. It's completely wireless. Let me know if
anything pops into your mind.
WEIR
(befuddled)
What do you mean? Uh, will I...just sort of sense something? Or is
it more of a...oh my god.
[Weir pauses. Replicator code appears within her mind's eye.]
MCKAY
I did it! I mean, well...she did it.
[Sheppard glances back at Weir, who's concentrating intently.]
MCKAY
But we need to move fast. Even though Elizabeth's nanites are only
in lurking mode, it won't take long for the Replicators to figure
out another player has joined the game.
SHEPPARD
How you feeling, Elizabeth?
WEIR
Very strange. I can suddenly see the entire city directly in front
of me--I mean, every corridor, every single room...
[Sheppard grins. Weir points out the window at a tower.]
WEIR
That way. The ZPM. Fourth quadrant, top level. Easy access. There's
hardly anyone around.
SHEPPARD
All right. Works for me.
EXT--ASURAS, DAY
[The puddle jumper flies to a low-level tower.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Ronon jumps up to leave as the jumper lands on the roof.]
SHEPPARD
All right, we're down. Rodney, stay here with Elizabeth. Keep
sifting through the intel. You guys can guide us through by radio.
[He joins Ronon in the rear as they prep their weapons.]
WEIR
Twenty meters to the left behind the jumper, there's an access door.
Down one flight of stairs, you'll enter auxiliary corridor seven.
[McKay, Sheppard, and Ronon all stare at Weir.]
WEIR
Go now. It's clear.
[Sheppard hesitantly nods at Weir as he and Ronon leave. McKay watches
Weir worriedly for a moment before bending down to his laptop again.]
INT--AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN
[Ronon and Sheppard move down the steps and pause at the entrance to
the corridor.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
We're at the corridor.
WEIR
(over radio)
Go right. At 6.5 meters, there should be another corridor.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Okay, we see it.
WEIR
(over radio)
Turn left. Wait! Go back.
[Sheppard and Ronon duck out of sight just as a Replicator walks by.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(into radio)
It's all right. He didn't see you.
MCKAY
Really? You-you know that?
[Weir snaps out of her trance for a moment.]
WEIR
Yeah. Like I said, it's very strange.
INT--AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN
SHEPPARD
(impatiently, into radio)
Can we go now?
WEIR
Yes. Go.
[Sheppard and Ronon run down the corridor.]
WEIR
(over radio)
Turn left, then right.
[They comply, checking the coast is clear before opening a door and
entering.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(into radio)
It should be directly in front of you.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Yep, I see it.
INT--ZPM ROOM
[They enter a small room with one control panel and a spot for one ZPM.
Ronon is already reaching for it when Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
Hold up, Chewie.
(into radio)
Aren't they going to notice when we pull the plug on this thing?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Probably, but they've got dozens of ZPMs. Let's just hope that they
don't...notice until we're long gone.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
That's wishful thinking. We still in the clear?
WEIR
There's a small group of Replicators two corridors over, heading
your way, so you need to move quickly.
INT--ZPM ROOM
[Sheppard activates the device to extract the ZPM and hands it to
Ronon, who packs it in the small case.]
RONON
Got it.
SHEPPARD
We're on our way.
[They head quickly out, closing the door behind them.]
INT--AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN
[They run through the corridor.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard and Ronon arrive.]
SHEPPARD
Hook up the ZPM. We're leaving.
MCKAY
Wait a minute, we can't go.
SHEPPARD
What are you talking about? You said you could get the hyperdrive
back on-line.
MCKAY
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected,
I-I've been going over the Replicators' base code, and I found this.
[He shows them a display on his laptop of Replicator code.]
RONON
What is that?
MCKAY
(excited)
The Holy Grail. It's their whole reason for being. It's a command
code that directs them to attack the Wraith.
SHEPPARD
But they don't attack the Wraith. They've been sitting on their
nanite asses for ten thousand years.
MCKAY
Well, that's because it's been deactivated.
WEIR
And how did that happen?
MCKAY
Well, I have no idea. Look, maybe the Ancients did it when they
realized they couldn't control them.
SHEPPARD
And you-you're just noticing this now, huh?
MCKAY
This is just one in millions of commands in the base code. Look, I
always had a hunch that something like this might be in there,
but-but, believe me, it was not easy to find.
WEIR
Can you reactivate it?
MCKAY
Yes. But there's a problem. Look, I can reprogram the nanites in
your brain and use that link to upload the changes, but we'll need
to wait for the next merge to affect all the Replicators at once,
and...we have no idea when that could be. Not only that, but the
instant it happens, they'll know you're there, they'll take
immediate steps to assimilate you.
SHEPPARD
Then we're not doing it.
WEIR
John, you know what this could mean. If the Replicators go to war
with the Wraith?
SHEPPARD
Forget about it. It's not happening.
WEIR
That's not your call!
SHEPPARD
The hell it isn't!
[He sits in the pilot's chair and preps to leave. Ronon also sits.]
MCKAY
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. There may be another way. There's a
central data core. Look, it-it-it's kind of like a...backup hard
drive for all the Replicators. If I can upload the reactivated
attack command directly into that, then we wouldn't need to use
Elizabeth. We could...be halfway back to Atlantis when the attack
command takes effect at the next merge.
SHEPPARD
(interested)
That sounds a little more like it.
MCKAY
Yeah. There is one small problem...which is not actually a small
problem.
WEIR
The core's at the center of the city, several levels down. It would
be impossible to get there undetected.
SHEPPARD
Right. We're gonna have to come back after we take the ZPM back to
Atlantis and after we land the city.
MCKAY
I-I don't think we'll have another chance.
WEIR
He's right. Once they notice the ZPM is missing, they'll be able to
trace the source of the infiltration. I will never get this kind of
undetected access again.
MCKAY
(shaking his head)
If we're gonna do this? It's now or never.
[The decision, made, Sheppard flies through the city. McKay tries to
hook the ZPM into they newly installed hyperdrive. Ronon sits nearby.]
RONON
You're going to turn the cloak into an anti-replicator field?
MCKAY
Yes, by interfacing the ARG's control crystal with the jumper's
cloaking generator. The only question is how far I can widen the
field.
(to Sheppard)
Look, go ahead and fly us as close to the center of the city as
possible.
WEIR
(pointing to a spot)
There.
RONON
But won't we be visible?
MCKAY
Yes, we will. The anti-replicator field will protect us. That
is...assuming that I can extend the field wide enough to encompass
not only the jumper, but also the core room, and...also assuming
that we can run fast enough to get there, input the command, and get
back before the Replicators figure out how to overrun the field
and-and-and...you know, slaughter us.
SHEPPARD
Don't worry about it. You're not coming with us. Neither is
Elizabeth.
[Weir gives him an incredulous look.]
MCKAY
I'm sorry, what?
SHEPPARD
You guys can guide us through by radio like you did last time.
MCKAY
Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are we supposed to input the
command?
SHEPPARD
Put it on a tablet. I'll plug it into the core and upload it myself.
MCKAY
Oh, plug and play, huh? What, you think it's that simple?
SHEPPARD
Well, it will be because you're gonna make it that simple.
MCKAY
Yeah, but...
SHEPPARD
(firmly)
I need you to stay here, Rodney.
MCKAY
Why?
SHEPPARD
Rodney!
WEIR
To keep an eye on me. You may need to activate the kill switch in
the nanites. You'll be able to keep a closer eye on me if we both
stay here in the jumper.
[Surprised, McKay turns to Sheppard, who's glaring at him.]
MCKAY
(abashed)
All right.
[He turns to find Ronon fooling with his equipment.]
MCKAY
(to Ronon)
Hey, get out of that! Hey!
[Weir points out the window at some buildings.]
WEIR
The core is beneath that platform.
SHEPPARD
How far beneath?
WEIR
Nine levels.
SHEPPARD
Piece of cake.
[They exchange falsely confident smiles.]
EXT--SPACE
[Apollo jumps out of hyperspace.]
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
[Carter sits at the starboard station. Lee is standing at the port
display panel. Ellis and the rest of the crew are at the normal spots.]
ELLIS
(to Lee)
Anything?
CARTER
(studying her controls)
Nope.
ELLIS
(sighing)
Eleven jumps.
CARTER
I'm sorry, even with the scanners' range significantly increased,
we've only covered a small area so far. We still have thirty-nine
more jumps before we reach the original Lantian planet.
ELLIS
Thirty-nine?
LEE
(musing)
Space is quite vast.
ELLIS
(unamused)
You don't say.
[Abashed, Lee closes his mouth and turns back to the display.]
ELLIS
(to crew)
Engage hyperdrive. Stop number twelve.
EXT--SPACE
[Apollo enters hyperspace.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard looks around.]
SHEPPARD
We're visible.
MCKAY
Engaging the anti-replicator field now.
EXT--ASURAS, DAY
[The puddle jumper sits on a rooftop, clearly visible. A light force
shield surrounds the ship.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The HUD activates, indicating the glow of the shield.]
MCKAY
It's working. Okay. Let's jack it up, see how far we can penetrate.
SHEPPARD
Penetrate?
MCKAY
(blankly)
What?
[Sheppard grimaces. McKay turns back to his computer.]
MCKAY
All right, here we go.
[The HUD shows the shield moving downwards through the building.]
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Four Replicators walk down the corridor. As the shield hits them, they
disintegrate.]
WEIR
It's working.
MCKAY
Damn right it's working. It's encompassed the core room. You're good
to go.
[Sheppard looks at Weir, who nods. McKay notices.]
MCKAY
What, you don't believe me, but you believe her?!
SHEPPARD
No offense.
MCKAY
Offense taken!
[McKay moves off with his computer.]
WEIR
Straight down. Nine levels. Then a short run down a corridor to the
core room.
[Sheppard heads to the rear compartment.]
MCKAY
Okay, I've written a basic block-storage transport protocol to
upload the attack command directly from this tablet into the core.
All you need to do is plug this cable into the main circuit and
it'll automatically configure and upload the command.
SHEPPARD
Plug it in.
MCKAY
You wanted simple.
SHEPPARD
I like simple.
[Sheppard straps the tablet around his neck.]
MCKAY
Well, we created that adapter to interface with Ancient tech, which
the Replicators love to imitate, so, uh, you shouldn't have a
problem there. Now, you need to move fast, because as soon as they
find out what we're up to, they're gonna figure out a way around it.
SHEPPARD
Just do what you did last time. We'll be back before you know it.
(to Ronon)
Let's go.
[He and Ronon and leave. McKay shuts the door behind them. Weir takes a
deep breath.]
INT--ASURAS CONTROL ROOM
[Oberoth enters.]
OBEROTH
What is it?
ASURAN TECHNICIAN
An anomalous energy reading in the second quadrant of the
communications tower.
OBEROTH
Source?
ASURAN TECHNICIAN
Undetermined as of yet. It's creating a disruptive field, emanating
downwards from the top level, encompassing nine levels directly
below it.
OBEROTH
(realizing)
The core.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Okay. We're here. Left or right?
WEIR
(into radio)
Left.
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Ronon and Sheppard move through the corridor. They turn a corridor to
run into three Replicators. Each raises their weapons as they advance.
The Replicators disintegrate as they reach the glowing shield.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
The shield's working, Rodney.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Good. Make sure to stay behind it.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Thanks for the tip.
WEIR
(into radio)
Now turn right.
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Ronon and Sheppard continue moving.]
INT--CORE ROOM
[Ronon and Sheppard enter a large chamber.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right, we're here. I'm assuming the big glowy thing is the core.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Indeed it is. Okay, there should be an open slot at the control
panel you can plug the cable into.
INT--CORE ROOM
[Sheppard pulls out McKay's tablet computer.]
SHEPPARD
All right. Here goes.
[He plugs it in.]
SHEPPARD
It's plugged in.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(confused, into radio)
Oh, it is? Why am I not reading anything? Are you sure you plugged
it in the right slot?!
INT--CORE ROOM
[Sheppard looks around.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
There's only one slot, Rodney.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(into radio)
Hurry, John. They're coming. And there's hundreds of them!
INT--CORE ROOM
RONON
(into radio)
Won't the field protect us?
MCKAY
(over radio)
As long as you hurry!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(panicking, into radio)
Okay, look. Uh...try plugging it in again.
INT--CORE ROOM
[He pulls out the cable and puts it back in.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right. It's plugged in again.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Still nothing. Look, what did you do?!
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I didn't do anything!
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Two by two, Replicators run up the corridor into the field. They
continue to disintegrate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(into radio)
They keep attacking the field. They're deliberately sacrificing
themselves.
INT--CORE ROOM
RONON
(into radio)
Why would they do that?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(realizing)
The more they attack the field, the quicker they can figure out how
to override it.
INT--CORE ROOM
RONON
(into radio)
Then we need to get the hell out of here.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, why is this not working?
MCKAY
(over radio)
It's not working because the core is not recognizing the tablet.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Well, why not?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Look, I don't know!
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Another pair of Replicators disintegrate, but later this time.]
INT--ASURAS CONTROL ROOM
ASURAN TECHNICIAN
We're almost through the field.
OBEROTH
Good. I'm on my way.
[He leaves.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Okay, you're going to need to implement adjustments in the
negotiation protocol to exploit parallelism at the device interface.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD AND RONON
(into radio)
What?!
MCKAY
(over radio)
Just do what I say. Start by unplugging the cable. Now access the
tablet's root directory.
[Sheppard moves to comply.]
SHEPPARD
(frustrated)
This is not simple!
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[A Replicator slowly pushes through the shield. Pairs of Replicators
follow, passing more easily each time.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
You have to get them out of there now!
MCKAY
We're not done!
WEIR
There's no more time! The Replicators have breached the field!
EXT--ASURAS, DAY
[The puddle jumper still sits on the rooftop with the anti-replicator
shield.]
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
What do you mean: "they've breached the field"?
MCKAY
They've figured out how to override it. Look, we need to move much
faster. You need to make changes to the negotiation protocol to
allow for direct data placement. We need to allow for
re-synchronization of the packet boundaries within the data stream.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
Oberoth is heading to the core room! He knows it's us!
MCKAY
Well, how far is he? Can they make a run for it?
WEIR
(desperately)
No. Replicators are approaching from every direction. They're
trapped!
MCKAY
Which means they're as good as dead.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
We can hear you, you know.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Wha-what? Uh, no. Wh-wh-when I say: "as good as dead", I mean it as
more of a-of a...
[While McKay has been speaking, Weir hits the release button on the
door and leaves the jumper.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
WEIR
Stay here!
[She runs out.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth, you can't go out there!
INT--CORE ROOM
MCKAY
(over radio)
Elizabeth!
SHEPPARD
What's going on, Rodney?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Elizabeth just left the jumper.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
Why?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
I-I don't know. Sh-she just-she just ran out.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Elizabeth, this is Sheppard. Do you copy? Elizabeth, respond.
RONON
If they capture her...
SHEPPARD
I know, I know.
MCKAY
(over radio)
So what do we do now?
RONON
She said to hit the kill switch on the nanites if she did anything
suspicious.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
I know, but...
[McKay collapses into a chair and looks at his computer.]
INT--CORE ROOM
RONON
Sheppard...make the call.
[Sheppard looks torn, but after a pause...]
SHEPPARD
Do it.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay looks equally upset. Eventually he starts typing, but the
computer won't accept his command and instead shows an error message
and makes a warning beep.]
MCKAY
It's not working.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
What?
RONON
Why not?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Ju-just give me a second.
[Sheppard and Ronon wait impatiently, Ronon continuing to guard the
door to the room.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(panicking)
I-I'm not getting confirmation. And don't ask why, because I don't
know, okay?! I mean, the last time she had active nanites inside
her, she was able to exert a certain amount control. Maybe...maybe
she's doing it here now? Or maybe there's interference that's
affecting the frequency? I don't know. I need to run a diagnostic.
INT--CORE ROOM
RONON
Better yet, why don't you figure a way how to get us out of here?
SHEPPARD
If we're screwed, we might as well complete the mission.
[He plugs the tablet computer back into the core panel.]
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Oberoth walks determinedly down a corridor. As he turns a corner, Weir
is standing there waiting for him. In a reversal of roles, she sticks
her hand into his head.]
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
[Oberoth and Weir face each other.]
OBEROTH
Doctor Weir?
WEIR
Hello, Oberoth. You're surprised.
OBEROTH
Indeed I am.
WEIR
Niam infected me with nanites.
OBEROTH
Yes, I can detect them now.
WEIR
We were able to neutralize them, and then reprogram and manipulate
them to suit our needs.
OBEROTH
Industrious of you.
WEIR
Which is why, now that I've been able to establish a physical link
through you, I have direct access to the Replicator collective.
[Oberoth considers this news, looking as if he's trying to defy her. He
appears frightened.]
WEIR
I'm in control now.
INT--CORE ROOM
[Sheppard finishes his connections.]
SHEPPARD
Okay, I've got it plugged in. Anything?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay studies his computer display. Suddenly lines of Replicator code
appear.]
MCKAY
Yes! Yes, it's working!
INT--CORE ROOM
[The door opens. Ronon hides behind the pillar, unnoticed as several
Replicators enter and face the core device itself. Sheppard takes cover
behind it. The Replicators suddenly freeze. As Sheppard rises with his
weapon and Ronon comes out from behind the pillar, they see the
Replicators' situation.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell just happened?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay pauses in his work.]
MCKAY
The Replicators have all frozen.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
Well, I can see that, but who did it?
[Ronon disarms the frozen Replicators.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Well, it wasn't me. It might have been Elizabeth.
RONON
(over radio)
Can she do that?
MCKAY
I don't know. I mean, she'd have to link directly with the
Replicator collective, which means, the chances they'll be able to
take over her nanites has just increased exponentially.
INT--CORE ROOM
SHEPPARD
Well, how long before they come back to life?
[Ronon finishes disarming the Replicators.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Your guess is as good as mine, but I would err on the side of less
time rather than more.
RONON
Can we go?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, first things first. How we doing with the upload?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay continues typing.]
MCKAY
Almost there. Just a few more seconds.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
How many seconds?
MCKAY
Don't start with that again!
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
[Oberoth appears to be struggling.]
OBEROTH
I'm impressed with your strength...Doctor Weir. But I must remind
you that it's only a matter of time...before I...make the necessary
corrections to overcome the hold you have on me.
WEIR
I am prepared to fight for as long as I need.
OBEROTH
Good for you. Your desire to protect your people is admirable, but
you will, ultimately, fail.
WEIR
Keep thinking that. Keep allowing your arrogance to undermine you.
OBEROTH
You know it's true, Doctor Weir. I can feel you weakening already.
[Now it is Weir who looks as if she is starting to struggle.]
OBEROTH
Despite your desire, this is a fight for which you are...clearly,
ill-equipped.
INT--CORE ROOM
MCKAY
(over radio)
That's it, you're done! Unplug and go!
[Sheppard pulls out the computer and they both run out of the room.]
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon rush down the corridors, passing several frozen
Replicators.]
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
[Both Oberoth and Weir appear to struggle. Oberoth finally reaches out
and grabs Weir's arm. She inhales deeply.]
OBEROTH
Once again, you have underestimated me.
[Weir continues to struggle against him.]
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[As Sheppard and Ronon move down a corridor, one of the Replicators
turns as they pass. Ronon knocks him back, but others give chase.]
SHEPPARD
Whoa! They're moving again!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Two Replicators enter the rear bay with weapons drawn. McKay raises
his hands in surrender.]
MCKAY
Yep. I know.
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
[Oberoth is more confident now. Weir lowers her head and closes her
eyes as if shutting down completely.]
INT--ASURAS STAIRWELL
[Sheppard and Ronon are closely pursued. As they reach a landing, armed
Replicators are waiting. The pair are at a standoff, with nowhere to
go.]
INT--ASURAS CELL
[Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon stand in the cell. Oberoth enters the
room.]
SHEPPARD
(insolently)
Well, this is familiar.
OBEROTH
I'm trying to decide if this incursion of yours reflects
considerable bravery or stupidity.
MCKAY
Where's Doctor Weir?
OBEROTH
Her attempts to seize control of the collective proved too taxing
for her, rendering her mind and body virtually moribund. She has
been taken to be...repaired.
SHEPPARD
You're going to take control of her.
OBEROTH
That has already occurred. Unfortunately, I was not able to glean
all the information I need from her. So, I will have to extract it
from you.
MCKAY
Information?
OBEROTH
About the precise location of Atlantis. You left your planet before
we were able to destroy it.
RONON
(deadpan)
Well, sorry to spoil your plans.
OBEROTH
Nothing is spoiled. Merely...prolonged. And now with your help, we
will complete the destruction.
SHEPPARD
Seeing how none of us will volunteer the information...
OBEROTH
You know quite well that we have a simple method for extracting what
we need.
[Oberoth signals with his head, and the cell shield lowers and the door
opens. Oberoth and others enter the cell. Two guards force Sheppard to
his knees. Another holds a weapon on Ronon to prevent his interference.
Sheppard winces as Oberoth enters his head. Oberoth winces, redoubling
his concentration. Sheppard looks unconcerned.]
SHEPPARD
Problems?
[Oberoth looks around. McKay and Ronon smirk at him. Oberoth pulls out
his hand. Sheppard morphs into Weir.]
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
OBEROTH
(shocked)
What?!
WEIR
I figured, you messed with our minds, so I'd mess with yours. You
didn't overpower me, Oberoth. The Replicator guards didn't capture
my team. It was all a fictional scenario played out in your mind. In
reality, your guards are still frozen, and my team is escaping as we
speak. You were wrong, Oberoth. I have never underestimated you, but
you have clearly underestimated me.
OBEROTH
(furious)
You will not leave this city alive!
WEIR
Maybe not. But my team will.
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon run down the corridor where in Oberoth's fiction,
the Replicators came to life. This time they have no problems.]
SHEPPARD
Still nothing from Elizabeth?
MCKAY
(over radio)
No. I can't communicate with her. I can't track her. It's like she
just-just disappeared.
SHEPPARD
If she's the one who froze the Replicators, that means she's
probably still alive.
MCKAY
(over radio)
For the moment, maybe.
SHEPPARD
Well, she can't be that far.
RONON
We'll find her.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
You'd better make it fast. These Replicators could unfreeze at any
moment.
SHEPPARD
(over radio, sarcastic)
Thanks, Rodney.
[McKay rolls his eyes.]
INT--OBEROTH'S MIND
OBEROTH
I admire your tenacity, but I won't be fooled again.
[Weir gulps, looking strained. Oberoth studies her.]
OBEROTH
You're struggling, Doctor Weir.
[They both redouble their efforts. Oberoth reaches out.]
INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR
[Oberoth grabs Weir's arm and starts to force her hand out of his head.
Sheppard and Ronon arrive, aiming their weapons at Oberoth, but unable
to get a clear shot because of Weir's position.]
SHEPPARD
Elizabeth...
WEIR
Get to the jumper.
SHEPPARD
You're coming with us.
[Ronon fires at Oberoth, but he stays in position.]
WEIR
I can't keep them frozen much longer!
SHEPPARD
We're not leaving you behind!
WEIR
If you don't leave right now, none of us will get out of here, so
go! That's an order.
[Weir half turns her head to look at him. Oberoth seizes the
opportunity to regain control. The Replicators unfreeze and start
firing at Sheppard and Ronon, forcing them to fall back.]
RONON
Come on!
SHEPPARD
Elizabeth?!
WEIR
GO!
[Replicators surround Weir as Sheppard and Ronon retreat.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard and Ronon race in, startling McKay who's working with the
ZPM.]
MCKAY
Oh, thank god!
[Ronon closes the door behind them.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth?
[Ronon shakes his head. McKay stands, stunned.]
SHEPPARD
Can we cloak? Rodney, can we cloak?!
[McKay snaps out of his fugue state.]
MCKAY
No. Not yet. No, we-we drained too much power trying to convert the
cloak into an AR field. Look, I-I'll try to interface the ZPM, but
we're gonna need some time.
[Sheppard powers up the jumper as McKay gets to work.]
SHEPPARD
All right, we'll just have to make a run for it, then.
EXT--ASURAS, DAY
[The puddle jumper lifts off and flies away at high speed.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(tightly)
How's hyperspace looking?
MCKAY
Not good. Look, harnessing power from the ZPM is tricky. If I'm off
even just the slightest amount, then we could all--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
Two ships headed our way.
[The jumper is rocked by a blast.]
SHEPPARD
Rodney?!
MCKAY
Look, I need more time!
[More explosions rock the ship.]
SHEPPARD
We just lost weapons!
MCKAY
Dammit.
RONON
Come on, McKay!
MCKAY
This is not simple, you know! If I don't properly calibrate the
power output, we could incinerate the moment the hyperspace window
opens!
SHEPPARD
I'm picking up something dead ahead.
[A Replicator jumper uncloaks directly in front of them blocking their
path.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, crap. They're powering up weapons!
[The Aurora-style battle cruiser is attacked by weapons on its port
side. Sheppard and the others look, but can't see the source from their
vantage point.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell was that?
EXT--SPACE
[The battle cruiser exchanges fire with the Apollo.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
ELLIS
(over comm)
Colonel Sheppard, this is the Apollo, do you read?
SHEPPARD
(surprised, into comm)
Colonel Ellis, is that you?
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
ELLIS
(into comm)
Affirmative. The 302 bay is open, and you have permission to come
aboard. I suggest you hurry.
SHEPPARD
(over comm)
Copy that, Apollo. We're on our way.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into comm)
Can I just add that your timing is pretty damn perfect?
CARTER
(over comm)
We would've gotten here earlier, but we had a little trouble finding
Atlantis.
MCKAY
(into comm)
Sam? Wha-is that you?
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
CARTER
(into comm)
It's me, Rodney. I'll explain when you get on board.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
Colonel...we lost Doctor Weir on the Replicator planet. Can you, uh,
lock on her locator beacon and beam her up?
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
[Carter checks her screen and exchanges concerned looks with Lee and
Ellis.]
CARTER
(into comm, sympathetically)
I'm not picking up any signal.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The team appear crestfallen.]
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
Copy that.
EXT--SPACE
[During the firefight, Sheppard's puddle jumper flies into the hangar
on Apollo. Apollo instantly opens a hyperspace window and escapes
through it.]
EXT--SPACE
[Atlantis flies through space. Its engines are powered, and the shield
encompasses the entire city-ship now.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Lee, Carter, McKay, Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla stand in front of a
display.]
MCKAY
Here's a good one. M35-117.
CARTER
Does Doctor Weir know about it?
MCKAY
Well, it's not on our primary or our backup lists. I purposely
searched for planets we'd never considered before. The, uh,
Replicators can probe her mind all they want, they won't find it.
SHEPPARD
Good...for us.
MCKAY
(subdued)
Well, look, it's a stable atmosphere, a big ocean, besides the, uh,
large, particularly venomous snake-like creature that inhabits the
mainland, it looks to be a welcoming environment.
[Carter and Lee exchange looks. Sheppard shrugs his approval.]
MCKAY
All right.
(into radio)
Radek, how we doin?
ZELENKA
(over radio)
All set here. The ZPM is online.
MCKAY
Okay. Here we go.
[He works the controls.]
EXT--SPACE
[A hyperspace window opens and Atlantis enters it.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE M35-117
[Atlantis exits hyperspace above the planet.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone heads to the still-shattered window to look at the
ocean-filled world below them.]
SHEPPARD
We did it.
MCKAY
Well, there's still the small matter of landing this thing.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. I'll just jump in the chair and ease us down.
CARTER
Well, that could be tricky. We drained a lot of power from the ZPM
just getting here.
SHEPPARD
Have we got enough energy to keep the shield up for reentry?
MCKAY
There better be. What, a city this size will create considerable
friction. We come in too fast or too steep, and the shield could
attenuate under the stress and the whole place could be torn to
shreds, or-or burn up, or both?
[Carter looks askance as she glances at Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
It never ends with you, you know?
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
Tell everyone to buckle up, we're going in.
[Sheppard leaves.]
EXT--SPACE, ORBIT ABOVE M35-117
[Atlantis enters the atmosphere.]
INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM
[Sheppard concentrates while sitting in the chair.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Lee and McKay sit at some controls. Teyla and Ronon stand
nearby.]
CARTER
Shields holding. So far so good.
[McKay sighs.]
TEYLA
What's wrong?
MCKAY
The angle's too steep. We keep going like this, we're gonna put too
much strain on the shield, which means more power draining from the
ZPM.
(into radio)
Sheppard, we're coming in too steep. You need to ease up on the
angle of reentry.
LEE
In fact, you mean entry. You see, we never actually left this...
CARTER
(warning)
Bill!
LEE
Oh, right, right.
[Lee goes back to watching his station.]
EXT--M35-117, DAY
[Atlantis's shield creates friction as it flies through the layers of
atmosphere.]
INT--CHAIR ROOM
MCKAY
(over comm)
Ease up on the angle.
SHEPPARD
(stressed)
I heard you the first time, Rodney.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into comm)
And yet, we're still coming in too steep!
[There is a heavy vibration.]
MCKAY
Hang on!
EXT--M35-117, DAY
[Atlantis enters the lower atmosphere over the ocean.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
LEE
We're over the ocean!
MCKAY
Sheppard, you need to slow us down. We're coming in over the water.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
SHEPPARD
Copy that.
EXT--M35-117, DAY
[Atlantis's descent slows.]
INT--CHAIR ROOM
MCKAY
(over comm)
Still too fast. Slow down!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
You want to touch down gently, like a...leaf kissing the surface of
a pond.
[The ship continues to shake. A sharp impact knocks everyone around.]
EXT--M35-117, DAY
[Atlantis lands in the ocean, splashing hard and pushing a wave of
water outward.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone regains their equilibrium.]
MCKAY
(sarcastic, into radio)
Nice kissing!
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Sheppard sits up and shuts down the chair.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
(still breathless)
How we doing?
[McKay checks his display.]
MCKAY
Systems are looking good...so far. And plenty of power in the ZPM.
CARTER
Drop the shield.
[McKay does so.]
INT--CHAIR ROOM
CARTER
(over comm)
Colonel Sheppard, we made it. The city's floating safely on the
ocean. Excellent landing.
SHEPPARD
(relieved)
Thank you.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Teyla picks up a photograph of Weir's dog Sedgewick on the desk and
studies it. Ronon enters. Teyla packs the photo in a box, following it
with Weir's laptop. Ronon enters quietly and slowly.]
RONON
Who do you think's gonna replace her?
[Teyla sighs heavily.]
TEYLA
I don't know.
[She picks up Weir's father's pocket watch.]
RONON
Whoever it is...that's tough shoes to fill.
[Teyla wraps the fob and chain around the watch and gently places it in
the box.]
TEYLA
(sighing)
Yes.
[Ronon places his hand on Teyla's shoulder. She reaches up and grabs
it, trying not to break down.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Lee hover over McKay, who's seated at a station.]
CARTER
Okay, let's give it a go.
MCKAY
Right.
[He dials the Stargate, which activates. Zelenka glances over upon
hearing the kawhoosh and breaks out into a smile.]
CARTER
(into comm)
This is Atlantis calling Stargate Command. Do you read?
[There is no answer at first, and they exchange nervous looks.]
SGC TECHNICIAN
We read you, Atlantis. It's good to hear from you.
[McKay sighs in relief. Carter breaks into a grin.]
CARTER
Great to be heard! Tell General Landry we're back on the grid.
ZELENKA
(nervous)
Rodney...?
MCKAY
What?
ZELENKA
Long range scanners have detected a massive fleet of ships being
launched from the Replicator planet...
[McKay gets up to join Zelenka.]
ZELENKA
But they're not heading for us.
[McKay studies the display.]
MCKAY
That's a Wraith planet. The attack command must have been activated.
Whaddya know, it worked.
[Zelenka laughs in triumph.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT
[Sheppard stands looking at the two moons floating above him. Carter
joins him.]
CARTER
There you are.
SHEPPARD
Two moons.
CARTER
Actually, there are five. It's just these are the only two visible
to the naked eye.
SHEPPARD
Really?
CARTER
Yeah.
SHEPPARD
Huh. I heard you and Rodney got us reconnected to the intergalactic
bridge.
CARTER
Yep. General Landry was understandably relieved to hear from us.
SHEPPARD
You know, in all the excitement, I never got a chance to
congratulate you.
[Carter looks puzzled.]
SHEPPARD
Your promotion. You're a full bird colonel now.
[He playfully salutes her. She nods, looking embarrassed.]
CARTER
Ah. Thank you.
SHEPPARD
So, you sticking around?
CARTER
No. General Landry wants Doctor Lee and I to 'gate back, give him a
full briefing on the situation here. The Apollo 's going to remain
in orbit for the time being in case you need any assistance.
[Sheppard nods thoughtfully.]
SHEPPARD
Thanks for saving our asses back there from the bad guys. That was a
risky move.
CARTER
It was nothing compared to the risk that you and your team took.
Frankly, I'm amazed you were able to pull it off.
SHEPPARD
(shrugging, uncomfortably)
We had a lot of help.
CARTER
(sighing)
Yeah. General Landry sends his condolences. He was deeply saddened
to hear about Doctor Weir...we all were.
SHEPPARD
I haven't given up hope. If there's a chance she's still alive, I'll
find her.
CARTER
I know.
[They stand together staring out at the night sky.]
