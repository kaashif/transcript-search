TEASER
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[SG-1 are walking around a plaza in front of a large building. It is
deserted.]
O'NEILL
Witness if you will, a ghost town.
CARTER
A very advanced ghost town.
DANIEL
The architecture may indicate an Earth ancestry.
[We hear a beep, beep and Daniel looks down at something he is holding.
At that same time, O'Neill steps in some squishy, yellow-gold substance
on the ground.]
O'NEILL
Aw, man...
[Carter grimaces.]
O'NEILL
Anybody have any idea what this is?
CARTER
I hate to say it sir, but it...seems like they might have a bit of a
pigeon problem.
O'NEILL
(Looks around quickly)
I don't see pigeons...and there should be a lot of them.
CARTER
Well, whatever did this, did so pretty recently.
[Daniel is shooting video.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps they suffered the same fate as the inhabitants of this city.
O'NEILL
Conjecture, Captain?
[Carter takes some readings with the instrument she is holding.]
CARTER
My data is consistent with the probe, sir. No radiation, the air's
almost 100% pollution free. Teal'c, it doesn't seem very likely that
the Goa'uld are responsible for this does it? I mean, what with the
indigenous people of this planet being...gone.
TEAL'C
That is correct. A Goa'uld attack would have resulted in much more
damage. Any technology would have been destroyed.
[Suddenly something large whizzes by, narrowly missing O'Neill. He
ducks to avoid the flying menace.]
O'NEILL
Whoa! Did you guys hear that?
[All other SG-1 members are now looking at Teal'c with expressions of
surprise and apprehension. There is now a very large winged bug on his
back. It looks like a cross between a mosquito and a dragonfly. Teal'c
slowly turns his head to look as O'Neill approaches him carefully.]
O'NEILL
(Obvious disgusted)
Ohh...
CARTER
What are you going to do?
[O'Neill takes out his pistol and aims it at the creature. Teal'c looks
on with some obvious trepidation. Daniel looks as though he wants to
say something but is afraid to...Just as O'Neill cocks the pistol, the
bug flicks its tail up and stings Teal'c and flies away quickly.]
TEAL'C
Ahh!
[He leans into a pole in front of him. He is in obvious pain.]
O'NEILL
God!
[He tries to shoot the bug as it quickly departs from Teal'c but is
unsuccessful and rushes to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
(Calmly to Carter)
Carter. Novacaine.
[Carter rushes forward to lend assistance.]
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[Daniel looks up as he is observing from a slight distance.]
DANIEL
Uh...we'd better get outta here.
O'NEILL
(Sarcastically)
No, really?
DANIEL
(Seriously)
No, really.
[Daniel points to the sky behind them. O'Neill turns to look. Hundreds
of the bugs appear over the top of the building and they are headed
toward SG-1.]
O'NEILL
God! Let's move! C'mon! Let's go!
[O'Neill and Carter each take and arm and begin helping Teal'c to
follow Daniel.]
DANIEL
I'll dial...
[All run as the bugs swarm and swoop down after the team.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The wormhole whooshes open and alarm klaxons can be heard. A control
room computer monitor flashes Alert! Incoming Traveller" on the screen.
General Hammond comes down the stairs from his office in time to see
SG-1 come through the wormhole.]
O'NEILL
Lock it up!
CARTER
Medical team!
[O'Neill and Carter help Teal'c as he collapses face down on the ramp.
General Hammond enters the Gate room followed by two armed SFs. Several
"splats" are heard hitting against the iris.]
HAMMOND
What is that?
O'NEILL
(Pointing wildly.)
Those are bugs, sir! Big...ugly bugs!
[The hits continue on for several seconds as they look on.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Janet is cutting away the material surrounding Teal'c's wound, then
gently pulls it back to reveal a very large, ugly welt with a hole in
the center of it. Teal'c is in obvious distress and is fighting to stay
calm.]
FRAISER
You're saying it's getting worse?
TEAL'C
I am.
[Janet takes a cotton swab and gently presses on the hole in the center
of the welt to get a sample. Teal'c moans.]
FRAISER
Easy...looks like some kind of a reaction. Teal'c, shouldn't your
larval Goa'uld be helping?
TEAL'C
That is correct, but it is not. It is, in fact, getting worse.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE INFIRMARY
[Janet emerges from the treatment room to speak with SG-1 and Hammond
who are waiting there.]
FRAISER
He seems to be suffering from the side effects of a viral
infection...fever, aches, chills.
CARTER
And his Goa'uld isn't helping?
FRAISER
No...that's not the worse part...
O'NEILL
What is?
FRAISER
The blood sample I took showed a rather disturbing amount of DNA
that doesn't match Teal'c's.
O'NEILL AND DANIEL
(simultaneously)
What does that...
DANIEL
...mean?
FRAISER
Actually, I'm not sure...um, to be perfectly honest with you, sir, I
think I may be out of my league here.
CARTER
General, if I may...when I was assigned to the Pentagon, I had the
chance to work with Dr. Timothy Harlow. He's one of the world's top
geneticists and he has full security clearance.
HAMMOND
He'll be here before the end of the day.
EXT--SGC EXTERIOR
[Trucks are going into Cheyenne Mountain.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Dr. Fraiser is working at a computer and Dr. Harlow is looking over
her shoulder as Carter walks in.]
CARTER
Dr. Harlow...
HARLOW
Sam...well...Ah...
[They hug warmly.]
CARTER
(Beaming.)
Hi.
HARLOW
How many times have I told you to call me Timothy?
CARTER
Timothy...you got here fast.
HARLOW
With a chance to see this? Light speed wouldn't have been fast
enough for me...and it's not a bit disappointing either. You're a
front line set up.
[He gazing around the lab.]
CARTER
Well, you haven't seen the best yet. I just wish it could have been
under better circumstances.
FRAISER
Dr. Harlow has some bad news.
HARLOW
A subsequent analysis of the blood sample revealed none of the
subject's matching DNA.
CARTER
Uh, the subject's name is Teal'c...and what are you talking about?
FRAISER
The blood sample I took had only a small percentage of alien insect
DNA in it.
CARTER
(nodding)
Right.
HARLOW
Now when the exact same sample of Teal'c's blood was tested only a
few hours later, it revealed only one type of DNA strand present.
FRAISER
Hmm-mmm...and it wasn't Teal'c's.
CARTER
Are you saying that the foreign DNA actually transformed Teal'c's
DNA in the blood sample?
HARLOW
Well, DNA doesn't alter DNA. It's probably some sort of retro-virus
present.
CARTER
OK...bottom line?
HARLOW
(sighs)
I can't believe I'm going to say this. It appears that the alien
insect's venom is rewriting Teal'c's genetic material and it
happened very quickly in that blood sample.
CARTER
The Goa'uld that Teal'c carries is supposed to provide him with
powerful immune capabilities.
HARLOW
Yes, so I read on the plane. It's amazing, but in this case, it
appears that it's merely stemming the tide rather than reversing the
problem.
CARTER
What happens if the Goa'uld loses the battle?
HARLOW
Well, 30 years of research into Human DNA, until last year I...I
didn't even know there were aliens...
CARTER
Right.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c lies in one of the beds. He looks very ill, sweating.]
TEAL'C
(Quietly, weakly.)
I have felt great pain, O'Neill, but never a sickness such as this.
I do not enjoy it.
O'NEILL
(Very concerned.)
Nobody does.
TEAL'C
I am also...feeling something else.
O'NEILL
Hey, I'd be scared, too.
TEAL'C
I do not want to become something other than who I am.
O'NEILL
Just let the doctors do their job.
TEAL'C
O'Neill...you are my friend. When there is no longer any hope...I
would rather die.
[O'Neill swallows and gives a slight nod, but does not answer.]
INT--SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[There is a knock on the door and the General looks up from his desk.]
HAMMOND
Come in.
O'NEILL
(opens the door and sticks his head in)
You wanted to see me, sir?
[Hammond nods in the direction of a visitor in the room, Harry
Maybourne.]
O'NEILL
(Disgusted.)
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
MAYBOURNE
Colonel O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Hello, Maybourne.
HAMMOND
I thought you would want to see this.
[He holds out some papers for O'Neill. O'Neill walks over, takes the
papers and reads them. Then he looks up straight into General Hammond's
eyes.]
O'NEILL
You've got to be kidding.
HAMMOND
It's an official order. I have no choice.
O'NEILL
Well, uh...what about...?
HAMMOND
The president is currently unavailable.
MAYBOURNE
This facility is front-line. Your mandate is search and retrieval.
Mine is research and development. As a source of information, Teal'c
has been invaluable to your operation. Now he may prove equally
invaluable to mine. This organism could be the biological weapon.
O'NEILL
He saved your smarmy ass and everyone else on this planet. Does that
count for anything in your world?
MAYBOURNE
Absolutely. I am thrilled to get the chance to thank him personally.
O'NEILL
General Hammond, request permission to beat the crap out of this
man.
[Harry looks a little nervously to General Hammond and then back to
O'Neill. General Hammond looks at O'Neill with a hint of a smile on his
face as he appears to be contemplating the request. O'Neill glares at
Maybourne.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Carter walks into the lab where Harlow is looking in a microscope. She
is not happy.]
CARTER
You son of a bitch.
HARLOW
Sam?
CARTER
It had to be you. Damn it, Timothy, Teal'c is my friend. He's
sick...
HARLOW
Yes, he is and he's going to get the very best help available...on
this planet. But your facility is not equipped for this kind of
situation and you know it.
CARTER
Please, don't tell me that you're ignorant here. I don't want to
feel sorry for you.
HARLOW
Maybourne's people can be unscrupulous, but if Teal'c is to have any
chance, it is with me...and I will do the best that I can.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c stands in a biohazard suit, cuffs are being placed on his
wrists. The cuffs are connected to chains which are connected to
shackles that have also been placed on his ankles. He is surrounded by
Special Forces.]
FRAISER
General, I have a right to stop this. He is not well enough to be
moved.
MAYBOURNE
Fortunately, I have a second opinion. He indicates Harlow who is
standing next to him. Harlow smiles.
[An SF places the biohazard helmet over Teal'c's head.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE INFIRMARY
[O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel are waiting outside.]
DANIEL
(shakes his head)
How can we just let this happen?
[O'Neill moves his head around as though trying to release tension in
his neck and shoulders, then rubs his hand on his forehead.]
O'NEILL
What do you want me to do?
CARTER
As much as I don't trust Maybourne, I have to admit...Timothy is the
best and he gave me his word he was going to help Teal'c.
[The door opens. Maybourne is first out, followed by Harlow, who smiles
briefly at Carter. Then Teal'c is escorted out, slowly, in his shackles
by two guards. He is followed by General Hammond and Janet. Teal'c
glances at his teammates as he is lead away.]
O'NEILL
(shakes his head as Janet and Gen. Hammond approach)
What's with the chains?
HAMMOND
Maybourne.
[Carter makes a disgusted sound.]
O'NEILL
Of course...
[Upset, Daniel looks away, unable to watch Teal'c being led away down
the corridor.]
O'NEILL
God!
[Enraged, O'Neill stalks away.]
EXT--A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS
[A white delivery truck is coming down the road.]
INT--INSIDE THE BACK OF THE TRUCK
[Teal'c is seated on one side flanked by SFs. Harlow and Maybourne are
seated further away nearer to the cab.]
MAYBOURNE
(Low to Harlow)
How long you figure he has?
HARLOW
It's tough to say. Depends on how strong the larval Goa'uld is. We
have drugs that may help.
MAYBOURNE
That won't be necessary.
HARLOW
Of course it is. We can...
(Realization dawns and he looks at Maybourne.)
You want him to change.
[Maybourne just looks at Harlow, then, Teal'c's hands begin to shake.
Reaching up to the helmet, he pulls and the chains of his manacles
break free and he screams in agony. He is quite pale looking and
appears to be in great pain.]
INT--TRUCK CAB
[The driver hears the screaming and loud thumps coming from the back.
Suddenly, Teal'c's arms burst through the glass and metal grate of the
small window separating the cab from the cargo area. He grabs the
driver who struggles.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter and Daniel are seated at the table. O'Neill is standing behind
them staring out into the Gate room.]
CARTER
All I'm saying is that notwithstanding what happened to Teal'c,
there may be invaluable technology on that planet.
O'NEILL
(Turns around and approaches the table leaning into Carter's face.)
Carter, there are bugs on that planet. Big, huge, ugly, honkin'
bugs.
HAMMOND
(Entering the room.)
Colonel, we just picked up an emergency communication from the
driver.
[Hammond leaves and SG-1 start to follow him.]
EXT--A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS
[The truck is disabled and sits slightly askew on the side of the
road.]
INT--THE TRUCK CARGO AREA
[Everyone is unconscious in the back and Teal'c has already freed
himself from his chains and suit. He has changed into one of the SF's
uniforms, but he reaches into his pouch to pull out his Goa'uld.
Grabbing one of the guard's walkie-talkies, he leaves the truck. The
squirming Goa'uld larva is left behind on top of the biohazard suit.]
EXT--COLORADO FOREST
[Teal'c is running through the forest.]
EXT--MOUNTAIN ROAD
[A military HumVee approaches the disabled truck. O'Neill, Carter and
Daniel get out of the vehicle and approach the delivery truck. O'Neill
and Daniel climb in the back. Carter checks on the driver. O'Neill
bends down to check Harlow.]
CARTER
(Through the cab window.)
The driver's unconscious.
DANIEL
(Near the back of the truck, looking down.)
Jack...
O'NEILL
(turning)
Yeah?
DANIEL
It's alive...
[Daniel reaches out to touch the weakened larval Goa'uld.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Janet is shining her pen light into the eyes of one of the guards that
led Teal'c away. Maybourne is sitting on a bed next to them with his
arm in a sling.]
MAYBOURNE
I want as many personnel and canine units as this base has at my
disposal 5 minutes ago!
O'NEILL
(walks in with Daniel following)
All of whom report to me. I'm running this search.
MAYBOURNE
This is still my responsibility.
O'NEILL
Oh, I'm holding you responsible, Maybourne, don't you fret. But the
troops are SGC. I'm running the show. You got a problem with that,
take it up with Hammond.
MAYBOURNE
(Rising and grabbing his jacket)
I will.
[Maybourne's departure is blocked by O'Neill.]
MAYBOURNE
(Quietly, to O'Neill only)
Striking an officer is a quick way to a court-martial.
O'NEILL
(looks down at Harry)
I'm not going to hit you, Maybourne. I'm going to shoot you.
[Maybourne stares irritably at O'Neill, then walks around him to
leave.]
O'NEILL
(To everyone else.)
All right...what the hell happened here?
HARLOW
Well, he just went crazy. He's so strong. I've never seen anything
like that.
DANIEL
What about the larval Goa'uld?
HARLOW
I don't know. He must have taken that out himself.
DANIEL
Why?
O'NEILL
Um...he told me he'd rather die than change into something else.
DANIEL
Well, there has to be quicker, less painful ways to kill yourself,
even for a Jaffa.
HARLOW
I don't think that's the way it's going to happen. I mean, I doubt
that he will die.
DANIEL
Uh, he depends on that Goa'uld to live.
HARLOW
The alien insect's venom is affecting his physical makeup. With
every passing moment, he is ceasing to be a...a Jaffa. The larva may
be the only thing that's holding that transformation back.
O'NEILL
So by takin' the worm out he might be expediting this...change?
DANIEL
Why would he do that?
HARLOW
Well, the metamorphosis...could be altering his mind.
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Teal'c's symbiote in a glass cylinder in fluid. Janet and Carter are
monitoring it.]
FRAISER
It's stable.
CARTER
I don't think it will be for long.
FRAISER
I just wish I knew more about Goa'uld physiology.
CARTER
The frustrating thing is, I might. Jolinar might have left me with
some information but I...
FRAISER
OK, look, we've got samples of the fluid from inside Teal'c's pouch.
So, for now, we'll just have to do our best to synthesize the
environment.
EXT--FOREST
[SGC Teams with dogs are searching the forest for Teal'c.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
O'NEILL
(pointing to a map)
...and there's no sign of him inside the perimeter.
HAMMOND
We don't have jurisdiction if he's already gotten outside of that.
DANIEL
(Running up the stairs)
We've got him!
[All follow Daniel down to the control room.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel leads Hammond and O'Neill down the stairs.]
DANIEL
There were picking up a radio in the field and patched it in here.
O'NEILL
(Taking a phone handset from an Airman.)
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
(over the phone)
O'Neill, it is I. Do not allow Col. Maybourne to follow me.
O'NEILL
He's not going to. Where are you?
EXT--FOREST
TEAL'C
I will not say.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
C'mon, Teal'c, where are you? We can help you.
EXT--FOREST
TEAL'C
It is too late.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
All right, listen. You're changing. You don't want this to happen.
You told me you'd rather die. Teal'c?
[Silence.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c!
EXT--FOREST
[The radio Teal'c had been using is abandoned on the ground.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill hangs up the handset, frustrated and worried.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[The larva in the tank. It is lying on the bottom of the tank and looks
weak.]
HARLOW
It is possible we can still save your friend...if we can get him
back.
CARTER
How?
HARLOW
Well, I have access to several variations of experimental RNA
inhibitors which are being researched at the moment, and combined
with the natural healing abilities of the symbiote...
FRAISER
Wait a minute. You knew this and you didn't offer right away when it
could have helped?
CARTER
Maybourne was hoping Teal'c would change and you were going to let
him.
HARLOW
No I wasn't...whatever you may think. Samantha, I am offering you my
help.
CARTER
(sighs)
OK, what do you need?
HARLOW
Well, we have to find out which of the drugs will work.
CARTER
How?
HARLOW
We need the alien insect's venom.
[Carter sighs as she appears to ponder how they're going to get it.]
INT--SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond and Carter are standing by Hammond's office window.]
HAMMOND
How do you know you can trust Harlow this time?
CARTER
I know and you think Maybourne put him up to this just to get a
specimen of the insect.
HAMMOND
I wouldn't put it past him.
[He goes over to sit down at his desk.]
CARTER
Right at the moment, sir, we don't have a lot of options.
[O'Neill and Daniel walk in.]
O'NEILL
We got nothin', sir.
DANIEL
Must have covered 20 miles in an hour.
HAMMOND
Maybourne is flying in his own personnel.
O'NEILL
Any action on the red phone?
HAMMOND
Still indisposed.
CARTER
In the meantime, we have kind of a good news/bad news scenario here.
If we do find Teal'c soon, we may have a way of saving him.
O'NEILL
OK...that's good news.
CARTER
But someone had to go back to BP6-3Q1 and catch one of those alien
insects, preferably alive.
[O'Neill cringes.]
DANIEL
And that would be the bad news.
O'NEILL
I'll go, sir.
CARTER
You'll need someone to watch your back.
DANIEL
And I'll go too.
HAMMOND
(Rising from his chair)
I'll make sure it's not for nothing. We'll find Teal'c.
O'NEILL
(Seriously.)
Pack your bug spray, kids.
[He leaves hurriedly.]
EXT--THE STREETS OF COLORADO SPRINGS
[Teal'c is walking down a street. We hear rap music in the background
and see several punks on the street hanging out. One of them notices
Teal'c coming their way.]
PUNK #1
Man, check this dude out.
(He approaches Teal'c, his buddies follow.)
Hey man, where you goin'?
(Teal'c slows and stops as he approaches the punks)
Hey, cool tattoo, man. Where'd you get that?
TEAL'C
Chulak.
PUNK #1
Chulak? Where's that? East side?
TEAL'C
Remove yourself from my path.
PUNK #1
(To the others.)
Listen to this guy.
(To Teal'c)
I'll remove myself when you tell me how they do tattoos like that in
Chulak.
TEAL'C
The skin is cut with an Orak knife and pure molten gold is poured
into the wound.
PUNK #1
(Grimacing.)
Ow, man, don't that hurt when they do that?
[Teal'c grabs the punk by the throat and moves him aside. The punk is
obviously scared.]
TEAL'C
Tremendously.
[He puts the punk down and continues on his way. He looks back over his
shoulder and about that time a younger child moves out to look at him.
The child is wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses and carrying a large
squirt gun.]
ALLY
That guy is cool.
PUNK #1
Ally, get outta here. No one wants you around.
[He pushes Ally. Ally leaves in the same direction Teal'c had gone.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The klaxons sound as the Stargate engages. Jack, Carter and Daniel are
at the base of the ramp, geared up and ready to depart. O'Neill glances
back one to the control room and the team then head up the ramp.]
EXT--CITY STREETS
[Teal'c is walking through a warehouse district. He notices a police
car and hears chatter on their radio. He continues on.]
INT--SGC
[Hammond is on the phone.]
HAMMOND
Yes. Thank you.
[He hangs up as Dr. Fraiser walks in.]
FRAISER
Any word on the search?
HAMMOND
No. How's the Goa'uld doing?
FRAISER
Not well.
HAMMOND
(quieter)
Damned if I ever thought I'd be praying for one of those things to
live.
FRAISER
(shakes head in agreement)
How long have they been gone?
HAMMOND
I'm about read to send SG-3 after them.
EXT--CITY STREETS
[Teal'c has walked up to what appears to be an abandoned building. He
walks towards it.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Teal'c enters the building. He is finding it more difficult to walk
and eventually collapses. He looks at his arms, now covered in
lesions.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The klaxons are sounding.]
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
Incoming wormhole. It's SG-1.
[Hammond looks at Janet and raises his eyebrow slightly. They both go
to watch SG-1 return. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c come through in a
rush. All are wearing gas masks.]
O'NEILL
(recovering from his tumble through the Gate)
Lock it up!
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The iris begins to close, but not before one bug flies through. It
dives toward O'Neill, who ducks and growls. He pulls off his mask and
looks to the entrances.]
O'NEILL
(To the control room)
Close those doors!
[The technician closes the blast doors.]
O'NEILL
(Looking around, his weapon raised.)
Where is it? Where is it!?
DANIEL
(pointing)
There!
[The bug flies around the Gate room and then straight toward O'Neill.
who fires his P-90 at it. The bug continues to fly over O'Neill, who
turns and continues to fire at it. The bug flies through the Gate and
falls to the ground on the other side. O'Neill gets up to investigate.
The bug is on the ground but still moving.]
O'NEILL
Just winged it.
[Carter approaches with liquid nitrogen or some other freezing
substance and shoots the bug.]
O'NEILL
(after a few seconds)
All right! Hold it...you got it!
[He touches Carter's shoulder and she stops.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[The bug lies on a table and Harlow is looking at it with a magnifying
glass. SG-1 and Hammond look on.]
HARLOW
Not your garden variety mosquito.
HAMMOND
There's no word on Teal'c yet, but Maybourne's put out an all points
bulletin to the state and local police.
O'NEILL
We've got to find him first, sir.
HAMMOND
Right at the moment, Maybourne has the manpower advantage and the
jurisdiction.
CARTER
You really should see this, sir.
[She pushed a remote and starts playing video that they recorded on the
planet.]
DANIEL
(by way of narrating)
We thought we heard noises coming from one of the buildings.
CARTER
It seems the final stage of the metamorphosis requires a dark place.
HAMMOND
That's a man.
DANIEL
It looks like the inhabitants of the planet were human...possibly
from Earth, originally.
O'NEILL
Daniel was right.
DANIEL
But their entire civilization was obviously wiped out by this
bug...and all those inhabitants were changed.
CARTER
It's amazing, really. I mean, they had all the technology we do,
maybe more. And they couldn't prevent their demise at the hands of a
simple insect.
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah, real simple.
[Carter raises her eyebrows in concession.]
O'NEILL
Take a look at this, sir.
[The video shows the cocooned form of the man they had been looking at
when suddenly several smaller versions of the bug erupt from the
cocoon. Then the video turns to static O'Neill cringes and swallows.]
HAMMOND
All those things came from one body?
[O'Neill looks to Carter.]
HARLOW
Of course...equal matter conversion.
CARTER
(nods her head in agreement)
It's how they reproduce. The insect's venom actually converts the
body's mass into it's own DNA material. But a human, or...in this
case, a Jaffa's total matter is far greater than one of the insect's
natural mass.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
HAMMOND
So Teal'c isn't going to turn into just one of those things.
CARTER
No, sir. He's going to turn into a whole lot of those things.
EXT--ABANDONED BUILDING
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Teal'c is looking at his hands, which seem to be covered in a sticky
substance. Just then Ally bursts into the room, pointing her squirt
gun.]
ALLY
Nobody move.
[Teal'c looks at her. He does not look good. There are lesions all over
his neck and face now too.]
ALLY
(very quietly)
Sorry. I didn't know the room was occupied.
TEAL'C
(almost a whisper)
What type of weapon do you possess?
ALLY
This? Chill, dude. It's just a water gun. I was playing, see?
[She squirts Teal'c who groans as the water hits him.]
ALLY
Uh, sorry, man. Please don't freak on me.
TEAL'C
Leave me.
ALLY
(taking off her cap to reveal long brown hair)
You're not from around here, are you?
(She removes her sunglasses and moves closer to Teal'c.)
Whoa, man, if you ask me...you look like you could use a couple more
days in rehab.
TEAL'C
No one must know that I am here.
ALLY
OK. Are you sure, though? I mean you look worse than my Dad did
after he got shot...and he died.
TEAL'C
You must leave.
ALLY
OK.
[She gets up to leave.]
TEAL'C
Wait.
ALLY
What?
TEAL'C
I must have nourishment.
ALLY
Oh, man! You want my chocolate bar?
TEAL'C
I must eat.
ALLY
(sighs)
OK. How 'bout we share it.
[She opens the candy bar and gives a chunk to Teal'c. She then eats
some herself.]
ALLY
Peanuts and caramel. Pretty good, huh?
TEAL'C
Can you get more?
ALLY
Maybe. What's in it for me?
TEAL'C
Peanuts and caramel.
ALLY
No, dumb ass, like I mean...what do I get?
TEAL'C
I have nothing to offer you.
ALLY
How 'bout...let's say you owe me one. Like in the Godfather...how's
that?
[Teal'c does not answer so Ally gets up to go.]
ALLY
OK...back in a flash.
TEAL'C
No one must know.
ALLY
Don't sweat it.
TEAL'C
I cannot prevent it.
ALLY
I meant OK.
[She leaves.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Daniel is helping Harlow with the examination of the alien insect.]
HARLOW
Will you retract that flap for me, please?
[Daniel looks around to be sure that Harlow is not trying to hand the
retracting tool to someone else. No one else is in the room.]
DANIEL
Me?
HARLOW
It's perfectly sedated.
[Daniel reluctantly takes the instrument.]
HARLOW
It's very tough armor our little friend has. Quite a creation. All
right, now...
[Carter walks in as Harlow begins digging into the bug.]
HARLOW
(whispering)
There.
[He pulls something out of the bug as Daniel and Carter look on.]
HARLOW
There's the juice.
CARTER
Uh, I worked out a probability model...absolute worse-case scenario
if the mutation in Teal'c runs the full course...
DANIEL
How bad?
CARTER
Well, the insect can multiply exponentially, so every person who's
stung could turn into about 10 bugs. Now, we don't have an exact
time on the incubation, but...
HARLOW
...But we're easily guessing on the safe side...
CARTER
We could have swarms in the order of millions in 6 to 8 weeks.
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Ally is eating a candy bar and doing recon. She looks on as police are
speaking to the boys Teal'c encountered earlier. Walking away, she
returns to where Teal'c is and finishes her candy bar as she
contemplates her next move. She thumps Teal'c with a candy bar.]
ALLY
Hey.
(hlds out a candy bar for him)
You a 'Kimble'?
TEAL'C
(whispering)
What is a 'Kimble'?
ALLY
What planet are you from? You know...Dr. Richard Kimble? The
Fugitive? I'm asking if you're wanted by the law. Looks like the
cops are asking about you on the street.
TEAL'C
They must not find me.
ALLY
What'd you do?
TEAL'C
I have done nothing.
ALLY
Innocent till proven guilty.
TEAL'C
You must leave.
ALLY
(licking her fingers)
Why?
TEAL'C
I am...dangerous.
ALLY
No way. You won't hurt me.
TEAL'C
How can you know this?
ALLY
I got the sense. My old man gave it to me. He was a cop. He could
tell who the bad guys were just by smellin' 'em.
TEAL'C
What is your purpose here?
ALLY
(shrugs)
Got nothin' better to do.
TEAL'C
Do you not attend an educational institution?
ALLY
What planet are you from? Duh...nobody goes to school in the summer,
unless you're stupid.
TEAL'C
What of the one who gave you birth?
ALLY
My mom? She works all day so I can get dinner and a place to sleep.
Listen, you're a sittin' duck down here.
TEAL'C
And ducks are bad?
ALLY
Uh...the sitting kind are. Here...if you can get up, I can show you
a place to hide.
[She takes Teal'c by the hand.]
INT--SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is on the red phone. O'Neill is standing across his desk.]
HAMMOND
Yes, sir. I understand. We will.
(He hangs up the phone and addresses O'Neill)
The president has overruled Maybourne's orders.
O'NEILL
So, if the local authorities find Teal'c, we get him back.
HAMMOND
Yes, but Maybourne still has jurisdiction to continue his search.
O'NEILL
OK...so the race is on.
EXT--ABANDONED BUILDING STAIRWELL
[Ally is helping Teal'c up a staircase.]
ALLY
Shouldn't you really see a doctor?
TEAL'C
I must rest.
ALLY
No it's just up...it's just a bit more up there. Almost...
EXT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[A white van pulls up to the building. Several men in hazmat gear
carrying weapons jump out of the van. Locking and loading, they rush to
the building.]
SF #1
Move it out...let's go!
[A second van approaches and more men pour out of this van. Maybourne
is in the front seat and he too exits the vehicle and peers up at the
building, donning his hat and then walks toward the building.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Using a battering ram, the soldiers break in the doors to the building
open.]
SF #2
We're through!
SF #1
Fan out!
INT--ELSEWHERE IN THE ABANDONED BUILDING
[Ally pats her hand on a ladder.]
ALLY
It's up here. It's not a long way.
[Teal'c climbs laboriously up the ladder. His head pops through a small
square hole in the floor.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Soldiers run up the stairs, weapons pointed as they continue to
search.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Harlow is showing Carter some readouts.]
HARLOW
I think we've got it. It's this drug that's actually slowing the
transformation in the sample. Now, that wouldn't cure a normal
human, but Teal'c may at least stand a chance with the help of his
symbiote's natural healing abilities.
FRAISER
We may not have that for much longer.
[Carter and Harlow move to where Janet is monitoring the symbiote.]
HARLOW
What?
FRAISER
It's dying.
HARLOW
What can we do?
[Carter shakes her head as she has no idea.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[SFs burst through a door as the search the room Teal'c and Ally were
just in. They spot Ally's water gun, and look around the room. The
camera pans to the ceiling where a pipe extends through a hole. Teal'c
stares down through the whole.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING--AN EMPTY CORRIDOR
[Ally peers around the doorway into the corridor. She steps out and
walks cautiously down the hall. She passes an SF who steps out of the
shadows behind her. Sensing his presence, she stops, realizing she's
been caught.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING--TEAL'C'S HIDING PLACE
[Teal'c lies curled on the floor, too weak to move.]
EXT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[SF's leave the building. Ally is being guided along by one of them.
She is brought to Maybourne.]
SF #2
This is all we found.
[Gently pushing Ally forward.]
MAYBOURNE
Hello, young lady.
[Ally gives him a snotty smile.]
MAYBOURNE
I'm Colonel Maybourne. I work for the United States of America.
You're government--the good guys.
ALLY
(rolls eyes)
Yeah, right.
MAYBOURNE
(Bends down to look her in the eye)
Oh, we're here on a little investigation. Actually, we're looking
for someone. He was last seen around this building. We think he
could still be here. Maybe you could help us. Now, he's tall...
ALLY
I ain't seen nobody, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
MAYBOURNE
Why is that?
ALLY
Because, I don't like the way you smell.
[Maybourne straightens up, glaring at her.]
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[O'Neill enters.]
FRAISER
Colonel, from the looks of it, we only have minutes.
O'NEILL
Captain, is there anything your Tok'ra memories could...
CARTER
I know, sir, I know. I can't just access them at will. Believe me,
I've been trying.
O'NEILL
Oh, it's too bad you can't zap it with those paddles like they do
on...E.R. That guys that's...
(he notices Janet staring at him.)
What?
CARTER
It couldn't be that simple.
FRAISER
Defibbing would kill it.
CARTER
But we've done our best to synthesize almost every environmental
condition the Goa'uld larva has inside Teal'c's pouch.
O'NEILL
What?
CARTER
Nutrition, temperature.
FRAISER
Except electrical current.
CARTER
And there is a very small constant electrical charge flowing through
all of our bodies. The Goa'uld may need that.
FRAISER
OK...so then all we need is a small enough power source.
CARTER
(Nodding.)
Yeah.
O'NEILL
(Still puzzled.)
What?
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Ally climbs the ladder to where she left Teal'c.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING--TEAL'C'S HIDING PLACE
[Ally appears at the ladder.]
ALLY
They're gone.
[She looks at Teal'c and is stunned.]
ALLY
Oh, my God.
[Teal'c is now beginning to turn in to a cocoon. He is covered in white
sticky stuff.]
ALLY
(slowly approaching)
What happened to you?
[She kneels down next to him and looks him over.]
ALLY
Man, this is like...serious alien stuff going on here. If you don't
tell me what to do, I am going to get the cops.
[Teal'c is gasping as he tries to communicate.]
ALLY
My Dad used to know a couple of guys we can trust.
[She starts to get up but Teal'c reaches out and grabs her hand.]
TEAL'C
No.
ALLY
But look at you. You don't really want this to happen, do you?
INT--SGC MEDICAL LAB
[Janet and Carter have hooked up an electrical current to the symbiote
tank. Harlow and O'Neill look on.]
FRAISER
It's getting better.
CARTER
It was so simple.
O'NEILL
Well...I guess my work here is done.
[Carter and Janet smile at each other. The phone rings. Janet goes to
answer it.]
FRAISER
Fraiser. Yeah. Colonel.
[She holds out the phone. O'Neill turns and walks to the phone.]
EXT--A PAY PHONE
[Ally is in the phone booth.]
ALLY
Hello...is this Colonel Jack O'Neill? It's about time. I only had to
talk to about 15 people to get to you. Do you know a big dude named
Teal'c? Yeah, man, I would hurry if I was you.
EXT--ABANDONED BULDING
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[O'Neill climbs the ladder up through the opening in the floor with a
flashlight. He enters the room and spots a near-completely cocooned
Teal'c on the floor.]
O'NEILL
Oh, my God.
[He hurries over to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c.
[Daniel is the next up the ladder. He sees O'Neill and Teal'c and is
alarmed, but calm.]
DANIEL
I'll go get help.
O'NEILL
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Yeah. It's me.
TEAL'C
Kill me.
O'NEILL
Uh...no.
TEAL'C
The change cannot be stopped.
O'NEILL
I won't lie to ya...you don't look so great...but you're going to
make it. You're going to be OK.
[O'Neill begins removing the white, sticky, stringy substance that is
covering Teal'c's face.]
EXT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Teal'c is being brought out of the building on a gurney. He is covered
with a blanket and only his head is visible. His face is quite pale and
covered with lesions. Ally is trailing along with Daniel and O'Neill,
who are following the medical personnel.]
ALLY
(To Daniel.)
Why can't I go with you?
DANIEL
Sorry, you just...can't. These guys here are going to take care of
you and make sure you're OK.
[Ally looks on forlornly as Teal'c is loaded into the back of the
military hum-vee while O'Neill supervises.]
ALLY
Is Teal'c going to be OK?
[She looks up at Daniel.]
DANIEL
I hope so.
ALLY
Me, too.
[Daniel walks toward the hum-vee in which Teal'c and O'Neill already
are waiting.]
ALLY
Hey...
[Daniel stops and looks back at her.]
ALLY
Tell him he still owes me one.
[Daniel nods.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter, Daniel, and O'Neill are sitting and waiting as Teal'c is
wheeled into the room. Dr. Fraiser, wearing surgical scrubs, is right
behind Teal'c. Harlow is also there, wearing scrubs.]
FRAISER
His pouch had started to close, but we were able to reopen it. The
Goa'uld is back where it belongs and it seems to be doing OK.
DANIEL
And Teal'c?
HARLOW
With the help of the drug, it appears the symbiote has stopped the
metamorphosis.
FRAISER
We're hoping the Goa'uld has the ability to reverse the damage
already done.
[Hammond walks in.]
DANIEL
It can't be easy knowing the thing you despise most about yourself
is what saved your life.
O'NEILL
Hey, even I'm happy he's got the snake.
HAMMOND
This sounds like good news.
CARTER
Hope so.
HAMMOND
Maybourne has ordered the insect specimen and all related research
transferred to the Area 51 facility.
O'NEILL
(shaking his head and under his breath)
I should've shot him.
HARLOW
I regret that's impossible, sir.
HAMMOND
Why is that?
HARLOW
Well, as soon as Teal'c is fully recovered, the insect is going to
be involved in an unfortunate lab accident. I'm afraid I'll have to
take full responsibility.
[Harlow smiles as Carter, who returns the smile. O'Neill raises his
brow in surprise, then nods his head in agreement. Teal'c lies
unconscious still, lesions still raw on this face.]
INT--ABANDONED BUILDING
[Ally is playing "cop" in the building with her water gun. She sneaks
around a corner and is surprised to see Daniel and a fully-recovered
Teal'c standing there. Teal'c is smiling warmly at her.]
ALLY
Teal'c!
[Taking off her sunglasses excitedly, she runs up to him.]
ALLY
Hi!
TEAL'C
(Grinning.)
Greetings, Ally.
ALLY
You're okay.
TEAL'C
(giving a slight nod)
Thanks to you I am feeling much better.
ALLY
Aw, man, it was no sweat. You look way better. I guess you can't
really tell me what happened...all that top-secret, James Bond
stuff, right?
TEAL'C
That is correct. To show my gratitude, I have brought you a new
weapon.
[Teal'c holds up a huge Super-Soaker water gun, and Ally gasps, her
eyes practically pop out of her head.]
TEAL'C
One with increased range and firepower.
ALLY
Wicked! This is so cool! Have any time to play?
DANIEL
Uh...actually we--
[A large stream of water suddenly blasts Teal'c in the chest as Ally
pulls the trigger on her new toy. Teal'c slowly looks down at the wet
spot on his chest while a musing Daniel wipes a little water out of his
own eye, which had been hit by some of the splash. Ally giggles and
runs off.]
DANIEL
Guess we shouldn't have loaded it, huh?
[Teal'c pulls out some sunglasses and puts them on, while Daniel wipes
away more water on his face. Teal'c then turns to Daniel.]
TEAL'C
How else could she defend herself?
[Teal'c then turns his water gun on Daniel and fires point-blank range
into Daniel's chest. Daniel gasps lightly at the shock of the cold
water on his chest as Teal'c takes off down the hall after Ally.]
DANIEL
(Dryly.)
How else?
[Daniel wipes his eye again, then pulls his tee-shirt away from his
chest and flaps it rapidly, shaking out the water.]
