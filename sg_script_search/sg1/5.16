     VOICEOVER
     Previously on Stargate SG-1...

   [Scenes from "Summit"--Ren Au explaining that they need someone to pose
   as a human slave at the upcoming System Lord summit. Someone who speaks
   fluent Goa'uld. Ren Au explains to Daniel that he will need to release
   a poison into the air which will kill all the Goa'uld symbiotes. Jacob
   explaining to Daniel that he should prick Yu with a ring that contains
   a chemical which will persuade Yu that Daniel is his servant, Jarren.
   Ren Au explaining to Carter that Martouf lives on in Lantash. The
   Goa'uld attack on Ravanna. Osiris arriving at the Summit. Lantash
   entering Elliot. Daniel explaining to Jacob that Sarah/Osiris is at the
   summit, and that he could have been recognised. Osiris finds Daniel,
   and the door on them closes.]

     VOICEOVER
     And now the conclusion.

   INT--Yu's quarters

   [Daniel and Osiris are alone. Osiris pull out a thin dagger and
   advances on Daniel.]

     OSIRIS
     What are you doing here?

     DANIEL

     (looking at the dagger and slowly backing away)
     Me? Right now? Nothing, why? You have something in mind?

     OSIRIS

     (he places the dagger at Daniel's throat)
     Insolence. Tell me what subversions you are a part of or I will
     bleed you dry.

   [Daniel still has the ring on. He grabs her hand releasing the
   chemical. Osiris backs away, looking confused.]

     DANIEL
     May I help you?

   [Osiris looks around.]

     OSIRIS

     (raising the dagger again)
     Who are you?

     DANIEL
     I am Lord Yu's servant. This is my master's quarters.

   [Osiris looks around, still a little dazed.]

     DANIEL
     You must have the wrong room. I've gotten lost a few times myself;
     these corridors all seem to look the same.

   [Osiris turns to walk away.]

     DANIEL
     If you don't mind my asking, isn't it forbidden to bring weapons to
     the summit?

     OSIRIS
     If you speak of it again, I promise, they will be your last words.

   [Daniel bows. She walks off. Daniel talks into the communicator.]

     DANIEL
     Jacob! You still there?

     JACOB

     (on the cargo ship)
     Yeah. What happened?

     DANIEL
     Ahh, Osiris and I kind of got into a...but the chemical worked.

     JACOB

     Why didn't you just release the poison?
     (long pause)
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Because I would have killed Sarah. There's got to be a way we can
     save her, right? You've taken symbiotes out of the host without
     killing them before.

     JACOB
     We'd have to get her out of there first.

     DANIEL
     So?

     JACOB
     Daniel. There's a bigger picture here. You have to release the
     poison. Do it now. You know what's at stake Daniel, no single
     person's life is more important. Complete your mission.

   [Daniel weighs Jacob's words.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [Gliders fly over a mounting ground invasion force.]

   INT--RAVANNA, TOK'RA TUNNELS

   [Carter, O'Neill, Teal'c and Elliot are looking around at the cave in.]

     ELLIOT
     Crystals.

     CARTER

     (supporting Elliot as they stand)
     What?

     ELLIOT
     The Tok'ra use crystals to form the tunnels.

     CARTER
     Yeah, we know that.

     ELLIOT
     And we can use them to make more.

     O'NEILL
     Where are they?

     ELLIOT
     The lab.

     O'NEILL
     All right, you wait here. Teal'c with me.

   [They leave in one direction, while Carter moves Elliot off in
   another.]

     CARTER
     Sir, see if you can find one of those Tok'ra communicators. We may
     need it.

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT ROOM

   [The System Lords are sat once again in the summit room. They are
   listening to Osiris. Some seem more convinced of her arguments than
   others.]

     OSIRIS
     Weakness is befalling the System Lords. If this tenuous alliance
     crumbles it will leave the Goa'uld vulnerable to threats that exist
     outside this galaxy. We must put aside our differences and
     individual struggles for power to strengthen the Goa'uld and ensure
     our supremacy over those who threaten our domination.

     YU
     You speak of grand principle--

   [Daniel gets out the poison.]

     BA'AL
     But you have no official seat here.

     OSIRIS
     Then I ask you to officially recognise my status here.

     BA'AL
     What do you offer as support for your claim for position as System
     Lord?

     OSIRIS
     Nothing. I am here to represent the vote of another.

     YU
     Whom do you serve?

     OSIRIS
     Anubis.

   [There is outcry.]

     OLOKUN
     What!

     BA'AL
     You lie!

   [He stands.]

     YU
     He is dead!

   [He rises in his seat.]

     OSIRIS

     (she rises and slowly approaches Yu)
     That was what you assumed after you attempted to murder him. Was it
     not enough that he was banished from the System Lords?

     YU
     Never to be allowed to return!

     OSIRIS

     That was long ago and only one System Lord remains from that time.
     (looking at Yu)
     He has sent me to ask that you accept him back or...place yourselves
     at his mercy.

   [Daniel puts the poison away.]

   INT--TOK'RA LAB

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter cautiously.]

     O'NEILL
     Bodies are gone.

   [Teal'c explores the ruins and finds a chest. Opening it, he sees a
   variety of crystals. Jaffa voices can be heard approaching. O'Neill,
   who is keeping a look out, see Jaffa close to one of the entrances to
   the lab.]

     O'NEILL
     We got company.

   [They take cover and 2 Jaffa enter the lab. They are shot by O'Neill.
   Jaffa are heard approaching at the sound of gunfire. Teal'c grabs a
   staff weapon. Teal'c steals one of their staff weapons and they peer
   round a corner, ready to defend their position.]

     JAFFA
     Tok'ra...pelnak....Kree.

   [The Jaffa enter, and O'Neill and Teal'c open fire. They kill three.]

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT

   [Daniel walks into Yu's quarters. He gets out the communicator.]

     DANIEL
     Jacob?

     JACOB

     (on cargo ship)
     Yeah. Are you ready?

     DANIEL
     Ah. Not exactly.

     JACOB
     Dammit Daniel.

     DANIEL
     Look I was going to do it and then Osiris said she was here
     representing another Goa'uld named Anubis.

     SELMAK
     He is dead.

     DANIEL
     Apparently not. He wants to rejoin the System Lords.

     SELMAK
     Why now? Where has he been for the last thousand years?

     DANIEL
     I don't know but we suspected there was a new Goa'uld out there on
     the rise, we just didn't know which one. Just turns out he's not so
     new.

     SELMAK
     If it is really Anubis--

     DANIEL
     Then killing all the System Lords here would just open the door for
     him to take over completely. You always said yourself; a bunch of
     warring System Lords is better than one all powerful one so...

     SELMAK
     You do not understand how bad Anubis is. He was banished by the
     System Lords because his crimes were unspeakable. Even to the
     Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, so. Guess what? Mission's off.

     SELMAK
     Anubis has not waited this long just to return to the System Lords.
     There must be more going on.

     DANIEL
     So...

     SELMAK
     You must stay and find out what it is. If you can.

   [Daniel nods reluctantly.]

   INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS

   [Carter is tending to Elliot/Lantash as they wait for Teal'c and
   O'Neill to return. There are dead bodies nearby of crushed Tok'ra.]

     ELLIOT
     They should have been back by now.

     CARTER
     I'm sure they're okay, they'll be back soon. How're you doing?

     ELLIOT
     It's very strange.

     CARTER
     I know.

     ELLIOT
     It's like...I suddenly know everything about someone else's life.
     Two other people actually. I hear his thoughts every now and then.
     But he's using all his strength to try and save me.

   [There's noise above, crashes. Carter looks up.]

     CARTER
     Sounds like they're coming round for another run.

   [One of the crashes is very loud. The chamber shakes and more debris
   falls.]

     ELLIOT
     What a joke.

     CARTER
     What?

     ELLIOT
     I can't believe I'm actually going to die on my first mission.

     CARTER
     You're not.

     ELLIOT
     Come on, Major. Even if this symbiote can fix what's wrong with me,
     we're never getting out of here.

     CARTER

     (falsely cheerful)
     Sure we are. You've read our mission files. We go through the Gate,
     get into trouble, get out of it, we go home.

     ELLIOT
     Tell that to Major Mansfield.

     CARTER
     Okay, forget the pep talk. You knew what you were signing up for.

     ELLIOT
     Yeah.

     CARTER
     You got this assignment because you were strong, both physically and
     mentally. Now give the symbiote inside you a chance. He needs you as
     much as you need him right now. Do not-

   [There is a huge crash. More of the ceiling collapses. Carter looks
   round to find the exit blocked. She looks at Elliot, then at the
   blocked exit, and sighs.]

   EXT--ZIPACNA'S MOTHERSHIP

   INT--ZIPACNA'S MOTHERSHIP PELTAK

   [Zipacna's First Prime walks up to Zipacna and bows.]

     FIRST PRIME
     The base has been infiltrated. Many dead Tok'ra were found as well
     as three humans of the Tau'ri.

     ZIPACNA
     Allies of the Tok'ra.

     FIRST PRIME
     A few Tok'ra we captured died before we could extract any
     information. However, moments ago, six Jaffa were found dead outside
     what we believe to be a lab. Three had obviously been killed by
     weapons of the Tau'ri.

     ZIPACNA

     (annoyed)
     Then there are survivors still free.

     JAFFA
     It would seem so.

     ZIPACNA
     What about the chemical weapon?

     JAFFA
     No evidence of it has been found. The Tok'ra computers were
     sabotaged before our ground troops arrived.

     ZIPACNA

     (greatly displeased)
     Then find the missing survivors.

     JAFFA
     The tunnels are extensive, my lord.

   [Zipacna looks angry.]

     JAFFA
     But we will not fail you.

   [He bows and leaves.]

   INT--TOK'RA TUNNEL

   [Carter is removing fallen debris to try and clear the tunnel. It is an
   insurmountable task.]

     ELLIOT
     He loves you Major. That's one of the only reasons he was fighting
     to live. He just wanted you to know.

     CARTER
     The symbiote I carried was Martouf's mate. Martouf and I became
     close friends because of it.

     ELLIOT
     I'm telling you he loves you. As much as he once loved Jolinar. He
     regrets what happened, that the host ultimately died. He doesn't
     want you to feel responsible.

     CARTER

     (quietly)
     It's okay.

     ELLIOT
     It's getting hard to breathe.

     CARTER
     Yeah. Hang on.

   [She continues to remove debris.]

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT

   [Daniel walks down a corridor and glances at a strange vat of some
   sort. He turns, and goes and investigates. The container has ornate
   carvings of Goa'uld symbiotes on. Removing the lid, Daniel discovers
   several symbiotes swimming inside it. He looks concerned.]

   INT--TOK'RA TUNNEL

   [Carter is still trying to move the debris. She stops, shaking her
   head, and looks over at Elliot, who is finding it increasingly
   difficult to breathe. The oxygen within the chamber is rapidly
   disappearing.]

     O'NEILL

     (over radio)
     Carter. Carter, if you hear me, respond.

     CARTER
     Sir, we're here. The tunnel collapsed. We're trapped.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, we noticed that. Listen, how do we use these crystals to move
     these walls?

     ELLIOT
     Each crystal is designed to create a different section of tunnel.
     Small, square ones will create short straight openings.

     CARTER
     Sir, use a small square one if you've got it.

   [Teal'c removes several crystals from his pocket and begins to study
   them.]

     O'NEILL

     Roger that.
     (to Teal'c)
     You got a small square one there?

     TEAL'C
     There are several of both square and rectangular design.

     O'NEILL
     Small?

     ELLIOT
     If they choose the wrong one they could collapse the tunnel in on
     us.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Sir, make sure you use the right crystal, it's perfectly square.

   [Teal'c holds up a crystal.]

     O'NEILL
     Looks square to me.

   [Teal'c sticks the crystal into the wall which removes the blockage and
   opens up to reveal Carter and Elliot.]

     O'NEILL
     Sweet.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c walk up to Carter and Elliot.]

     CARTER
     Thank you.

     O'NEILL
     You bet. Any time.

     CARTER
     Did you find a Tok'ra communicator?

     O'NEILL
     No. No, we didn't.

     TEAL'C
     Many Jaffa troops search the tunnels. They will be here soon.

     ELLIOT
     Use the long rectangle.

   [Teal'c checks his pocket. He plants a crystal in the wall which
   disintegrates and morphs into a new tunnel.]

     O'NEILL

     (impressed)
     Nice.

     ELLIOT
     You should seal the tunnel behind us.

   [O'Neill picks up Carter's P-90 and Teal'c uses the staff weapon to
   fire on the ceiling of the tunnel, causing it to collapse.]

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT, YU'S QUARTERS

   [Osiris is talking to Yu. Daniel is preparing tea and listening
   intently.]

     OSIRIS
     Time has taught him humility and respect for the union of the System
     Lords.

     YU
     You take me for a fool.

     OSIRIS
     Please. The Goa'uld have warred with each other since the beginning
     of time. Anubis has been amassing power so that he may win back your
     respect. He is also no fool. He knows you would not accept him back
     without need.

     YU
     We do not need Anubis!

     OSIRIS
     Dissent and disbelief previously unseen in the ranks of the Jaffa,
     infiltration and subversion by the Tok'ra and you cannot continue to
     ignore the threat of the humans on Earth.

   [He glances at Daniel, who is pouring tea.]

     OSIRIS
     How many must die, how many dominions must fall and how can we
     continue to claim to be Gods if we cannot act like them? The Tau'ri
     cannot be allowed to triumph again and again.

     YU
     The treaty with the Asgard protect their planet.

     OSIRIS
     From the System Lords.

     YU
     Who must enforce the treaty upon all Goa'uld.

     OSIRIS
     But not from one who's been dead for a thousand years.

     YU
     What do you propose?

     OSIRIS
     Accept my vote on behalf of Anubis and before he resumes his
     position amongst you, he will destroy Earth.

   [Daniel briefly looks up.]

   INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS

   [Teal'c is supporting Elliot while Carter leads. O'Neill is bringing up
   the rear.]

     O'NEILL
     How many more of those things do we have?

     TEAL'C
     Six.

     CARTER
     We can't stay down here forever, we're out of water.

     TEAL'C
     The Jaffa will not rest until they have found us.

     O'NEILL
     Why do you say that?

     TEAL'C
     If their intent was simply to kill the Tok'ra they have weapons that
     could have destroyed this facility from space.

   [Elliot coughs and is in obvious difficulty.]

     TEAL'C
     Their attack using ground troops suggests they are looking for
     something.

     CARTER
     The poison.

     ELLIOT
     We can't let them have it. If it comes down to it we'll have to
     destroy the crystal that contains the formula.

     O'NEILL
     Come on. They got to stop looking for us eventually.

     TEAL'C
     Even if they do stop searching, they will never leave the Stargate
     unguarded.

     O'NEILL
     Well, Jacob and Daniel will be back sooner or later.

     ELLIOT
     The Tok'ra will have broadcast an alert telling them to stay away.
     They will assume we died along with the other Tok'ra.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe.

     CARTER
     Well without any way of communicating with them, how will they find
     us?

     O'NEILL
     Let's keep moving.

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT, CORRIDOR

   [Olokun's slave walks by, while Daniel watches. When he has left,
   Daniel gets the communicator out.]

     DANIEL
     Jacob?

     JACOB

     (over radio)
     Yeah. Go ahead.

     DANIEL
     They're going to vote on whether to accept Anubis back. Apparently
     he has a plan to attack Earth.

     JACOB

     (on cargo ship)
     Did you get any details?

     DANIEL
     Osiris didn't say. Hey, here's a question for you. Why do you think
     the Goa'uld are allowing their human slaves to hear everything
     that's going on?

     JACOB
     I'm not sure. The truth is, we suspected they were going to kill the
     slaves when the Summit was done.

     DANIEL
     And you didn't think that was important enough to tell me?

     JACOB
     Not considering that you were going to kill all the Goa'ulds.

     DANIEL
     I'm not doing that any more.

     JACOB
     True. What's your point?

     DANIEL
     There's a big vat of live symbiotes here.

     JACOB
     So they're not planning on killing the slaves after all.

     DANIEL
     Not by the looks of it.

     JACOB
     Get to the shield generator and shut it down. I'll get you out of
     there.

     DANIEL
     Not yet.

     JACOB
     Daniel, if you're caught and that poison falls into the wrong hands.

     DANIEL
     I won't get caught.

   [He puts the communicator away at the sound of footsteps nearby.]

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT CHAMBER

   [Each of the Goa'uld are seated again, with their human slaves just
   behind them.]

     BA'AL
     Who among us accepts the return of Anubis to the System Lords?

   [Ba'al clasps his hands and nods his head, so does Olokun. Morrigan
   nods her head, Kali nods, Bastet nods. The other unnamed System Lord
   does too. Yu shakes his head.]

     BA'AL
     The vote need not be unanimous. By a count of six to one, Anubis is
     awarded the status of System Lord and welcomed back among those that
     lead the Goa'uld. Osiris will be allowed to vote on his behalf.

     OSIRIS
     You shall not regret this.

     BA'AL
     May we rule forever.

     OLOKUN
     There is much to discuss in that regard.

     BASTET
     But first.

     BA'AL

     (opens his hands and looks to the ceiling)
     Lor kor harak.
     (shouts)
     Sha mel.

   [The lights go out and something is ringed in. It is the vat of
   Goa'uld. The System Lords get up and gather round the vat. Ba'al,
   Osiris then Kali reach in and take one out. The slaves present look
   confused. The rest of the Goa'uld reach in and we see them bite into
   the symbiotes and eat them. Daniel looks disgusted.]

   INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS

   [Carter is tending to Elliot, who is fading fast. Teal'c approaches
   from the far end of the corridor.]

     TEAL'C
     There does not appear to be any Jaffa currently pursuing us.

     O'NEILL
     Good, we haven't heard bombers in a while. Let's try the surface.

     CARTER
     Elliot, can you hear me? How do we use the crystals to tunnel up to
     the surface?

     ELLIOT
     Surface?

     CARTER
     Yeah, we wanna get up there and get some water.

     ELLIOT
     Diamond.

   [Teal'c gets the collection of crystals from his pocket, and starts to
   look for a diamond.]

     CARTER
     You said the Tok'ra are probably transmitting an alert to warn
     others away.

     ELLIOT
     Long range sensors, detect incoming ships, transmit signals to deep
     space.

   [Teal'c and O'Neill look at the crystals, but several appear to be
   diamond shaped. They are unclear. Teal'c chooses one.]

     CARTER
     Could we reprogram one to signal Jacob and Daniel?

     ELLIOT
     It's possible.

     TEAL'C
     Where are they?

     ELLIOT
     Four of them, 25 miles from the Gate, each is due north, south, east
     and west.

     O'NEILL
     I figure we're three miles from the Gate.

     CARTER
     Give or take. Either way, we have to get to one of those sensors.

   [She picks Elliot up. Teal'c plants the diamond crystal and a tunnel
   appears, leading to the surface.]

     O'NEILL
     Let's go.

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT

   [Daniel and Ba'al's slave are preparing something.]

     DANIEL
     You knew they were going to eat them?

     SLAVE
     Yes. They do that every night for as long as the summit continues.

     DANIEL
     What do you think will happen when this is over, to us, I mean?

     SLAVE
     That is between you and your master.

     DANIEL
     Don't you think it is strange that the Goa'uld are letting us see
     their sacred rituals, hear their most secret conversations?

     SLAVE
     I have been in the service of my master for 24 years. In that time I
     have seen and heard many, many things. Have you not?

     DANIEL
     My master's regular Lotar could not be present. I took his place on
     short notice.

     SLAVE
     I see.

     DANIEL
     May I speak honestly with you?

     SLAVE
     Have you not been honest prior to now?

     DANIEL
     Yes, of course. What I mean is, can I trust you that no matter what
     I say, this conversation will remain between us?

   [The slave nods.]

     DANIEL
     I believe the Goa'uld are powerful beings, that use humans like us
     as hosts. I believe they use their power to portray Gods so the
     masses will follow and serve them.

     SLAVE
     I agree.

     DANIEL
     You know this to be true?

     SLAVE
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     And yet you still serve?

     SLAVE
     As do you.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but my fear is, when this is over, my master will not wish me
     to spread the secrets that I have learned and will kill me to
     prevent it.

     SLAVE
     You would not be here if your master did not trust you.

     DANIEL
     True. But what if they do not care what we have seen and heard
     because when they are done eating the symbiotes they plan to put the
     leftovers in us?

     SLAVE
     You should only be so fortunate.

     DANIEL
     Excuse me?

     SLAVE
     I have served my master so well for so long in the hope that one day
     he will grant me the honour of implantation.

     DANIEL
     The honour?

     SLAVE

     (enthusiastically)
     Yes. Endless pleasure and the power of the Goa'uld. And the chance
     to one day ascend to the rank of System Lord.

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT ROOM

   [Daniel walks back in with a jug.]

     BASTET
     I lost two motherships in that battle.

     OSIRIS
     Your strategy was obviously weak.

   [They exchange hostile glances.]

     YU
     Your master has exacted tolls from each of us.

     OSIRIS
     Yet you have all voted to welcome him back into the fold.

     BA'AL
     The power he has regained so quickly is worthy of respect.

     OLOKUN
     What does he offer now to repay the damage he has done in garnering
     his forces?

     OSIRIS
     Anubis owes the System Lords nothing. He joins you for the greater
     good of all Goa'uld.

     BA'AL
     Anubis may have grown strong but he does not outweigh the collective
     power of the System Lords. What deed does Anubis offer as evidence
     of the dedication you claim on his behalf?

     YU
     Speak now or leave us.

     OSIRIS
     As I have said before, Anubis believes that the greatest threat to
     the Goa'uld is that from within.

   [Daniel listens more intently.]

     OSIRIS
     As we meet here, that threat is being greatly weakened. Over the
     years we have all lost a great deal to the infiltrations,
     subversions and rebellious acts of the Tok'ra. Today, will be
     henceforth as known as the day the blood of the Tok'ra ran free and
     their rebellion ended for good.

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [The landscape is pockmarked with craters from explosion. Carter comes
   up a bank with some water while O'Neill and Teal'c make a stretcher for
   Elliot.]

     TEAL'C
     There are gliders patrolling the area.

     O'NEILL
     I figure we got twenty, twenty five miles to go in that direction.

     CARTER
     With this terrain, I figure we can make a mile every fifteen
     minutes. That should hopefully put us at the sensors in under nine
     hours.

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT, CORRIDOR

   [Daniel stops a slave.]

     DANIEL
     Excuse me. I wish to pass on a message from my master Yu to Osiris.
     He wishes to meet.

   [The slave nods and leaves.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [Daniel's voice comes over the communicator.]

     DANIEL
     Jacob?

     JACOB
     What the hell's going on Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Anubis knows the location of the Tok'ra base. Osiris says he's
     attacking right now.

     JACOB
     Get to the shield Daniel, shut it down. I'm coming in.

     DANIEL
     Forget that, I have a new plan.

     JACOB
     What are you doing?

   [Daniel enters Yu's cargo ship.]

     DANIEL
     I'm stealing Yu's cargo ship. I can fly out from inside the shield
     without shutting it down, right?

     JACOB
     Yes, why?

     DANIEL
     Uh, 'cos I'm taking Osiris with me.

     JACOB
     Do you have her now?

     DANIEL
     No, but I'm working on it.

   [He powers up the systems on the ship.]

     JACOB
     Daniel, the chemical weapon you're carrying could be the only way we
     can stop the attack on Ravanna.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, and Osiris could eventually lead us to Anubis. And you and
     your buddies can do your best to take the snake out and save Sarah,
     right?

     JACOB
     How are you going to fly that ship?

     DANIEL
     Well, I've flown a mothership. How hard can this be?

   INT--GOA'ULD SUMMIT, CORRIDOR

   [Ba'al's slave comes across Yu.]

     YU
     Where is my Lotar, Jarren?

     SLAVE
     I have not seen him, your lordship.

   [Yu walks off.]

     SLAVE
     My lord? Forgive me. While you know I faithfully serve my master
     Ba'al, and therefore hear whatever I say with certain suspicion. I
     believe it is my duty to tell you that your new Lotar cannot be
     trusted.

   [Yu walks off.]

   INT--Yu's CARGO SHIP

   [Osiris walks in, but there is no one to greet her. She looks around
   suspiciously and pulls out her dagger. She walks into the cargo hold
   and Daniel runs in to close the doors.]

     OSIRIS
     Stop!

   [The doors close and Daniel walks backwards only to be sent flying by
   Yu as he hits Daniel. Yu opens the doors and is stabbed by Osiris.
   Daniel tries to run to the escape pod, but is grabbed by Osiris and
   thrown backward. She grabs him by the neck, and places the dagger at
   his throat. Daniel tries to push the dagger away.]

     OSIRIS
     How unfortunate that Lord Yu could not trust his slave. Each was
     mortally wounded in the fight as the slave attempted to kill his
     master.

     DANIEL
     Sarah. It's me, Daniel.

   [Osiris is momentarily distracted by this statement. Yu suddenly grabs
   Osiris and pulls her off Daniel. They battle for possession of the
   dagger. Daniel punches some buttons and heads for an opening escape
   pod. He jumps in and Osiris shoves off Yu. She heads for the buttons to
   stop Daniel but can't get there in time.]

     OSIRIS
     No!

   [The pod punches out and goes through the shield.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [Jacob sees the pod.]

     JACOB
     That better be you Daniel.

     DANIEL

     (over the communicator)
     Get me out of this thing.

     JACOB
     I'm on my way.

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are carrying Elliot. Carter ahs taken point.]

     ELLIOT
     Major?

     CARTER

     Hold up.
     (to Elliot)
     Yeah.

     ELLIOT
     I better tell you how to reprogram the sensor.

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [The pod is ringed in and promptly falls over. Jacob runs in and opens
   the pod.]

     JACOB
     Are you okay?

     DANIEL

     (in pain after falling backward)
     Oh yeah. Thanks.

   [Jacob helps him out.]

     JACOB
     What happened?

     DANIEL
     I had her and then Yu had me and I had to get out of there without
     her finding out.

     JACOB
     The poison?

     DANIEL
     It's right here.

     JACOB
     Good man.

   [They go to the front seats.]

     DANIEL
     How long is it going to take us to get there?

     JACOB
     Pushing the hyperdrive engines full power, six hours. But we may
     already be too late.

     DANIEL
     I know this may seem unimportant right now, but I may as well tell
     you anyway. I think I figured out why the Goa'uld population hasn't
     been growing much lately.

   [The ship jumps into hyperspace.]

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [Teal'c and O'Neill are carrying Elliot on the stretcher.]

     CARTER

     (off camera)
     Colonel.

   [Carter clears away some debris off the sensor.]

     O'NEILL
     Nice.

   INT--ZIPACNA'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Zipacna is reading from a Goa'uld data device. His First Prime
   enters.]

     FIRST PRIME
     My lord. A cargo ship was detected exiting hyperspace but it cloaked
     immediately. Its current location is unknown.

     ZIPACNA
     Huh. Deploy a squadron of gliders. And have them scan the atmosphere
     for disturbances. And if the ship even attempts to land on the
     planet, shoot it down.

   [The First Prime bows, then turns and starts to leave.]

   What about the survivors?</blockquote>

     JAFFA
     They have not been found as yet, my lord. The search continues.

     ZIPACNA

     (annoyed)
     Then join the search yourself. And if you do not find either the
     formula or a living Tok'ra who can tell me of it, do not bother to
     return.

   [He returns to reading the data device.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [A beeping starts.]

     JACOB
     We're getting an alert from the surface.

     DANIEL
     What's it say?

     JACOB
     The base has been compromised. Assume no survivors. We should go.

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [Elliot lies on the ground while Carter works on the sensor device.]

     CARTER
     That's it. I'm done.

     O'NEILL
     How do we know it's working?

     CARTER
     I guess if someone comes to rescue us.

   [O'Neill nods, then looks up at the sky.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [There is another bleeping sound.]

     JACOB
     We're getting another signal.

     DANIEL
     What is it?

     JACOB

     (a small smile starts)
     It's an SOS.

     DANIEL
     Well, it has to be Jack or Sam.

     JACOB
     Hopefully both. And more. Let's ride.

   EXT--SKY

   [Gliders start to fire on the cloaked ship.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

     DANIEL
     What the hell?

   [The cargo ship uncloaks.]

     JACOB
     We've been hit. Our cloaking mechanism has failed. They must have
     locked onto our heat signature as we passed through the atmosphere.

   [More shots are fired.]

     JACOB
     I can't shake 'em.

   [There are sparks from control panels. The cargo ship starts to shake
   ever move violently.]

     JACOB
     I can't shake 'em. I'm diverting power to the shields. We're losing
     altitude fast. Hang on Danny, we're going in.

   [The Ravanna forest can be seen through the ship's window.]

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c look round as they hear the firefight above
   them.]

     TEAL'C

     (pointing to the sky)
     There.

   [Jacob's cargo ship can be seen hurtling toward the ground, with a
   plume of smoke billowing from it. Gliders chase it.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

     JACOB
     This is going to be rough.

   [Both he and Daniel brace for impact.]

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [The cargo ship crashes through trees, bumps over a hill, and nosedives
   into soft earth, coming to a halt. There are several shots of Jacob and
   Daniel inside the ship, flinching as they hit trees.]

   EXT--RAVANNA

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Stay with Elliot.

   [Teal'c and O'Neill go to the cargo ship.]

   INT--JACOB'S CARGO SHIP

   [Daniel comes to. He is hunched over the control panel, but still in
   his chair. As he comes to sparks erupt from the panel. Jacob is lying
   on the floor, with blood on his forehead.]

     DANIEL
     Hey. You okay?

     JACOB
     Not really.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you'd think a race advanced enough to fly around in space
     ships would be smart enough to have seat belts, huh?

     JACOB
     We just prefer not to crash.

     DANIEL

     (pulling Jacob up)
     Come on, we'd better get out of here.

   EXT--RAVANNA

   [O'Neill and Teal'c come down a little path and meet Jacob and Daniel.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you injured?

     JACOB
     I'll live.

     O'NEILL
     How's our ride?

     JACOB
     It's not going anywhere fast.

   EXT--RAVANNA FOREST

   [Carter is tending to Elliot when she hears someone approaching. She
   brings up her P-90. She sees it is Jacob, followed by the other members
   of SG-1.]

     CARTER
     Dad. You all right?

   [They embrace briefly.]

     JACOB
     Yeah. Looks worse than it is. Are you all right?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I'm fine.

     DANIEL
     How's Elliot?

     CARTER
     He's in rough shape. He got injured during a cave in, Lantash went
     into him to try and save him but it's not working.

     JACOB
     There's a chance we might be able to save the cargo ship but not
     before this whole area is swarming with Jaffa. Those gliders
     definitely made our position.

     TEAL'C
     We cannot escape through the Stargate.

     DANIEL
     We still have this.

   [He gets the poison out.]

     JACOB
     As much area as that will cover I don't think the chemical will
     spread from here to the Stargate.

     CARTER
     Well we can't release it here, it will kill you, Elliot and Teal'c.

     O'NEILL
     Then I guess I've got to figure out a way to get it to the Gate.

     JACOB
     It's suicide. You're assuming the Jaffa won't shoot you on sight.

     TEAL'C
     Given the lack of cover and the size of the Jaffa army, I do not
     believe even I could make it to the Stargate undetected.

     ELLIOT
     Leave it here with me.

   [They all turn and look at Elliot.]

     O'NEILL
     What good's that going to do?

     ELLIOT
     Leave here and hide. The Jaffa will find me. I'll tell them I know
     the formula, they'll take me to the Gate.

     TEAL'C
     He is correct. He will be taken to the base camp by the Stargate
     before being sent to the mothership.

     O'NEILL
     Won't they search him first?

     ELLIOT
     Then I'll....Then I'll set off the weapon, take out as many as I
     can.

   [SG-1 exchange glances. Elliot closes his eyes, and Lantash takes
   control.]

     LANTASH

     Please. We're both going to die. I cannot save us.
     (looks directly at Carter)
     But there's a chance we can save you.

     O'NEILL
     What about Elliot?

     ELLIOT
     It doesn't make sense for any of you to risk your lives to try and
     save me. Give me the device.

   [Daniel looks to O'Neill, who looks away, then nods reluctantly. Daniel
   gives him the device.]

     ELLIOT
     Now go. They'll be here soon.

   [Carter caresses the side of his face. He looks at Carter.]

     ELLIOT
     He's happy now; he just wanted you to know how he felt.

     CARTER
     I do. And I'll never forget him. Or you.

   [A glider flies over.]

     TEAL'C
     Ground forces will not be far behind.

     JACOB
     Sam, we got to go.

   [Carter strokes Elliot's cheek as he looks terrified. Carter is led
   away by Jacob. O'Neill nods at Elliot, then walks off. Elliot is left
   alone, his breathing laboured. He hears a Jaffa hunting horn, and puts
   the poison in his pocket. He looks terrified but resolved. Many Jaffa
   footsteps can be heard, followed by another horn blast.]
