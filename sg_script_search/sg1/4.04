TEASER
FADE IN
INT--GATE ROOM
[The Gate activates. Guards surround it with their weapons drawn. The
iris is closed.]
TECHNICIAN
(on intercom)
Offworld activation, repeat, we have an offworld activation.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and O'Neill enter the room.]
TECHNICIAN
We're receiving Bra'tac's IDC, sir.
O'NEILL
Bra'tac?
HAMMOND
Open the iris, have Teal'c come to the Gate room.
INT--GATE ROOM
[O'Neill walks in. A lone cloaked figure exits the wormhole. The guards
aim their weapons. The figure removes the cloak and reveals herself as
a beautiful woman. She spreads her arms in a gesture of peace.]
SHAUN'AUC
I mean you no harm.
[The Gate disengages.]
O'NEILL
Bra'tac...you've done something with your hair!
HAMMOND
(in control room)
Identify yourself!
SHAUN'AUC
I am Shaun'auc of the Red Hills. Master Bra'tac opened the Chappa'ai
but was unable to accompany me.
O'NEILL
Why is that?
SHAUN'AUC
There is much unrest on Chulak. He took great risk in sending me
here.
[Teal'c enters the Gate room.]
TEAL'C
(surprised)
Shaun'auc!
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Friend of yours?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[O'Neill signals for the guards to lower their weapons. Shaun'auc walks
down the ramp to Teal'c and they stand staring at each other, holding
hands.]
SHAUN'AUC
Tal matte, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
Kell matte!
[O'Neill clears his throat to gain Teal'c's attention.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c...how about a little introduction of some sort.
SHAUN'AUC
There is no need.
[She turns to face O'Neill.]
SHAUN'AUC
Bra'tac has told me much of the Tau'ri. You are O'Neill...Teal'c's
apprentice.
O'NEILL
Yes...
(realizes what she said)
...apprentice?
[Teal'c smiles at O'Neill.]
SHAUN'AUC
Also a warrior of great skill and cunning.
O'NEILL
Apprentice?
[Hammond enters.]
SHAUN'AUC
Hammond of Texas, a great and strong leader among humans.
HAMMOND
What can we do for you?
SHAUN'AUC
You must take me to the Tok'ra immediately.
[O'Neill raises his eyebrows in surprise.]
SHAUN'AUC
I have information that could destroy the Goa'uld.
[They all stare at her.]
END OF TEASER
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--DAY
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1, Hammond, Fraiser and Shaun'auc are sitting around the table.]
SHAUN'AUC
I have found a way to communicate with my symbiote.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Is that possible?
TEAL'C
It is not.
SHAUN'AUC
That is what we were trained to believe, Teal'c. The Goa'uld have no
wish for the Jaffa to influence their young.
DANIEL
That makes sense.
TEAL'C
How then was this communion achieved?
SHAUN'AUC
With in a deep state of Kel-no-reem.
CARTER
Well, we know that the symbiote is completely isolated from the
Jaffa who carries it. How can there be communication?
FRAISER
Medically speaking the symbiote acts almost like an internal organ.
There's an exchange of hormones and electrical impulses, but it's on
a completely unconscious level.
HAMMOND
It's a function of their immune system.
[O'Neill looks at Hammond, surprised at his knowledge.]
SHAUN'AUC
It has taken many years, but I have raised that primal communication
to the conscious level.
DANIEL
Oh, ok, assuming that you...err...what do you talk about?
SHAUN'AUC
I have convinced it that the Goa'uld are evil. That its own desires
for power and domination are wrong. It is willing to join the Tok'ra
and reveal all Goa'uld secrets to them.
[She looks at Hammond]
O'NEILL
I know I'm just the apprentice at this table, but...
TEAL'C
Why then not instruct this symbiote to deliver these secrets
directly?
O'NEILL
Exactly.
SHAUN'AUC
We do not communicate in words. It is more feelings, images,
memories. It will only be fully capable of communicating the
knowledge it was born with once it takes a host.
CARTER
And since you convinced it that the Goa'uld are evil it will only
take a willing host?
SHAUN'AUC
(in pain)
It is most urgent!
TEAL'C
Your symbiote is ready to take a host even now!
SHAUN'AUC
It has already passed its time. You have my word that it will harm
no one. I have convinced it to wait!
[O'Neill raises his eyebrows in disbelief.]
FRAISER
Once a Goa'uld larva leaves the body the Jaffa's immune system stops
functioning. You're putting yourself at great risk.
SHAUN'AUC
I believe that risk is worth taking. If you would take me to the
Tok'ra immediately?
HAMMOND
We can't do that. I'm sorry.
[She looks around at everybody]
SHAUN'AUC
You do not believe I speak the truth.
DANIEL
No, it's not that we don't believe you...
TEAL'C
(interrupting)
We do not. What you say cannot be proven.
O'NEILL
I think what Teal'c's trying to say is that...
TEAL'C
I have said precisely what I intended, O'Neill!
[They stare at each other.]
O'NEILL
Ok, then I guess what I'm trying to say is that we'd like to believe
you, we really would...
SHAUN'AUC
You have my word...
(looks around)
...but that is not enough!
(She stands to leave)
Then the secrets of the Goa'uld will die with me!
HAMMOND
Shaun'auc, please understand?
[The symbiote stirs in her pouch.]
SHAUN'AUC
(in pain)
I do understand, General Hammond, Bra'tac was wrong about the wisdom
of the Tau'ri!
[She collapses to the floor in agony. Everyone stands, alarmed.]
TEAL'C
Shaun'auc! Shaun'auc!
[The symbiote suddenly half emerges from her pouch. Everyone is
shocked. O'Neill looks disgusted at the symbiote.]
HAMMOND
(to guard)
Airman!
[The guard aims his gun at the symbiote.]
TEAL'C
Do not!
SHAUN'AUC
(To her symbiote)
Taluk, mak kal'ma. Shal tai...shal tai...shal tai.
{The symbiote recedes into her pouch. Shaun'auc passes out.]
TEAL'C
Dr Fraiser, you may now approach.
[Fraiser runs over to help Shaun'auc.]
FRAISER
We need to get her to the infirmary.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is monitoring Shaun'auc who is asleep in an infirmary bed.
Teal'c is sitting on the bed watching her. O'Neill and Hammond are also
present. Fraiser walks over to Hammond and O'Neill.]
FRAISER
She wasn't exaggerating. The symbiote is fully adult.
O'NEILL
Yeah, saw that!
HAMMOND
So her immune system is breaking down?
FRAISER
Yes, I'm not sure how long the symbiote will remain before it has no
choice but to seek out a new host. That is its primal instinctual
behavior. I may have to recommend quarantine, sir.
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
Well, if you think so?
[O'Neill looks shocked to have been asked.]
O'NEILL
Absolutely...sir!
SHAUN'AUC
No.
[Fraiser walks over to the bed.]
FRAISER
I gave you a sedative. You should be asleep.
SHAUN'AUC
Kal'ma has neutralized the sedative.
FRAISER
Kal'ma?
TEAL'C
(angrily)
It means child.
(To Shaun'auc)
The demon you carry within you is no child!
SHAUN'AUC
Do I not carry it in me as I would my own? Have I not taught it
right from wrong as any mother would? You have closed your mind,
Teal'c. I expected more!
[Hammond and O'Neill exchange glances at this outburst.]
TEAL'C
May we speak privately?
SHAUN'AUC
My symbiote has assured me that this will not happen again.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Oh well, if the snake says so then who are we!
[Fraiser, Hammond and O'Neill exit. Shaun'auc grimaces in pain.]
SHAUN'AUC
The others I can understand, but you have known me since before I
went to the temple! How can you doubt me? This is my life's work!
TEAL'C
A life lived in worship of the Goa'uld!
SHAUN'AUC
No, I believe now as you do that they are false gods.
TEAL'C
Words from one who became a priestess in the temple.
SHAUN'AUC
(emotionally)
One day as I meditated in the temple with the others I heard the
thoughts of my symbiote! Dreams that were not my own! I reached out
to them with my mind and I heard it answer. Not in words but in
grotesque images and pain. I realized then that the being that I
carried was no god! A powerful mind yes, but not that of a god. I
dedicated my life that day to showing it the way of peace. It
understands now that the Goa'uld are an abomination. Can you not see
what it is that I offer?
TEAL'C
Bra'tac is wise, but I do not know why he would have sent you here
like this!
SHAUN'AUC
He believes, Teal'c. How can I make you believe too?
TEAL'C
There is a way.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel and Carter are reviewing information on the Goa'uld as O'Neill
knocks and walks in.]
CARTER
How is she?
O'NEILL
Err...Fraiser says she has maybe a couple of days tops. Find
anything?
DANIEL
No, but Teal'c knows more on the subject than I ever will.
CARTER
He sure doesn't believe her.
O'NEILL
(leaning down on the desk)
Well, there may be a little more than meets the eye here. I'm
thinkin' they got history!
CARTER
History?
O'NEILL
Oh yeah!
DANIEL
She's a temple priestess.
O'NEILL
So?
DANIEL
So they don't do a lot of dating.
O'NEILL
Maybe not, but there was some serious sparkage when she arrived!
CARTER
Ok, the question is, what if she's telling the truth?
O'NEILL
So what, she can't tell the Tok'ra any more than they already know
can she?
CARTER
Actually, sir, she can, the Tok'ra...
O'NEILL
(interrupting)
...Consider themselves different than the Goa'uld, I know. But let's
call a snake a snake, shall we?
CARTER
Physiologically they're both parasitical and pass on their knowledge
through genetic memory, yes, but the majority of the Tok'ra left the
Goa'uld gene pool over two thousand years ago.
DANIEL
Yeah, they probably learnt a thing or two in that time.
CARTER
Which makes Shaun'auc's symbiote very valuable, sir. To us and the
Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
If Teal'c doesn't buy it then I don't buy it and there's no way of
proving it, so what are you going to do?
[Teal'c enters the room.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill?
[O'Neill turns round and sees him.]
O'NEILL
Master Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I am in need of your assistance.
O'NEILL
I'm here to serve!
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson, Major Carter I am in need of your assistance also.
[They look puzzled and follow him from the office.]
EXT-- CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--EVENING
INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS IN THE SGC
[The room is full of lit candles. Teal'c is sitting ready to meditate
and the rest of SG-1 watch over him.]
TEAL'C
In the deepest levels of Kel-no-reem the heart beats in extremely
long intervals. It is even possible to meditate so deeply that one
may stop the heart altogether. The practice is forbidden.
CARTER
Wouldn't your symbiote try to start it up again?
TEAL'C
That is correct. According to Shaun'auc it is only at this time that
a communion between Jaffa and symbiote is possible.
CARTER
Like a near death experience?
TEAL'C
That is correct.
O'NEILL
Is it dangerous?
DANIEL
Jack, he's stopping his heart.
[O'Neill looks annoyed at Daniel.]
O'NEILL
I mean for us!
[Daniel looks embarrassed.]
TEAL'C
I am unsure of what will occur if and when communion with my
symbiote is achieved. It may be necessary to restrain me.
O'NEILL
Well...knock yourself out!
[Teal'c meditates as SG-1 watch anxiously.]
[He sees a vision of a Jaffa being dragged by other Jaffa, and a
woman.]
TEAL'C
(opening his eyes)
I believe I saw a vision of my father!
DANIEL
It's working?
TEAL'C
I will begin again.
[He meditates and sees his father and the woman. Cronus appears and
Teal'c's father is brought before him. He crushes Teal'c's father's
symbiote by thrusting his hands into his pouch, and kills his father.
As his father dies in the vision, Teal'c collapses in his quarters.
Carter rushes to the phone in the room as Daniel and O'Neill move to
help him.]
CARTER
Medical emergency, Teal'c's quarters!
[Teal'c opens his eyes.]
TEAL'C
That will not be necessary, Major Carter.
CARTER
(on telephone)
Belay that last order and stand by.
[She puts the phone down.]
O'NEILL
(To Daniel)
Get him up.
[They help Teal'c to sit up.]
O'NEILL
What happened?
TEAL'C
I have received a vision from my symbiote. It was a memory it chose
to share. Its hatred for me is great.
CARTER
Then it is possible. Shaun'auc is telling the truth.
TEAL'C
Yes...yes!
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Anise is waiting to meet with SG-1 and Hammond. She walks to the
briefing table and sits down.]
ANISE
The great queen Egeria. She broke from the Goa'uld over 2000 years
ago. Her offspring became the Tok'ra.
DANIEL
Egeria, Roman goddess of fountains.
O'NEILL
Fountains?
DANIEL
Also childbirth.
O'NEILL
How do those two go together?
DANIEL
It doesn't matter. She was also adviser to Numa Pompilius, a
legendary ruler.
ANISE
Correct, Dr Jackson. Egeria came to the Tau'ri to stop the Goa'uld
from taking humans through the Stargate as slaves. Ra found her and
killed her, but not before she had spawned our movement.
CARTER
Literally?
ANISE
Yes.
O'NEILL
Thanks for the image.
HAMMOND
Then the original number of Tok'ra is all you have?
ANISE
Very few Goa'uld came over to our side, but none in the past few
hundred years. Our numbers have diminished as symbiotes unable to
find new hosts died or fell in battle. That is why Shaun'auc's offer
is so provocative. Until the symbiote is blended with a host we
cannot be sure of the outcome. But if what she claims is correct we
could one day increase our numbers.
HAMMOND
So you've decided to accept her offer?
ANISE
I will make the proposal to the Council with my recommendation.
O'NEILL
How long will that take?
ANISE
It will not be an easy decision. There are great risks involved.
CARTER
She doesn't have a lot of time.
TEAL'C
Shaun'auc's symbiote is fully mature. It must take a host within the
day, two at most.
ANISE
Then I will leave immediately.
[She stands, as do the others.]
TEAL'C
(To Anise)
I would make a personal request.
FREYA
What is it, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
Shaun'auc came to this world expecting not to survive.
FREYA
She needs a symbiote to replace that which she now carries.
TEAL'C
By the time you return it may be too late.
FREYA
There are no Jaffa within the Tok'ra ranks.
TEAL'C
(emotionally)
I do not wish for her to die.
FREYA
I cannot promise, Teal'c, but we will try.
[Teal'c bows and Anise leaves.]
INT--VIP QUARTERS
[Teal'c enters the room. There are many candles lit and Shaun'auc is
sitting meditating on the floor.]
TEAL'C
(smiling)
The Tok'ra council is considering your offer.
SHAUN'AUC
My symbiote is eager to meet them. I hope they can reach their
decision within the time.
[She clutches her stomach in pain. Teal'c reaches down and helps her to
her feet.]
TEAL'C
Your pain grows worse!
SHAUN'AUC
Yes.
TEAL'C
For what reason did you wait so long?
SHAUN'AUC
I was afraid you would not believe. Since word came to the temple
that you betrayed Apophis I have thought of you every day.
TEAL'C
As a Shol'va?
SHAUN'AUC
No, Teal'c. Because of you my doubts became certainties. When we
were children you were always the strongest, the bravest. That you
would one day be First Prime was never doubted. But you did what no
Jaffa before you had ever done. You challenged the gods themselves
and won.
(she strokes his face)
Among many on Chulak you are as revered as the gods once were and
yet you walk away.
TEAL'C
My place is here.
SHAUN'AUC
Is it? Bra'tac cannot be expected to bear the burden alone. It was
you who first began walking this path. Do not abandon those who have
followed you this far!
[She turns away from him. He grabs her and spins her around.]
TEAL'C
(angrily)
I have abandoned no one.
[He releases her and she walks away again then turns to him.]
SHAUN'AUC
When I die and you are the only one capable of teaching others what
I have learned, what will you do then?
TEAL'C
Do not concern yourself with me.
SHAUN'AUC
I have all but given my life for a cause that you inspired!
TEAL'C
Tal shak kree!
[She looks shocked at him.]
TEAL'C
I will advise you when there is news.
[He turns to leave the room.]
SHAUN'AUC
When you touched the mind of your symbiote, what did it show you?
[Teal'c stops.]
TEAL'C
The murder of my father. It was a most painful death.
SHAUN'AUC
At the hands of Cronus?
TEAL'C
Yes.
SHAUN'AUC
It wanted you to know fear.
TEAL'C
Yes.
SHAUN'AUC
You are stronger than that. Why does it appear to have succeeded?
[She walks up to him. He is facing away from her.]
SHAUN'AUC
My first communion was the same. It took many days before I tried
again. But one day the images it chose to share with me began to
change. They became sorrowful, as though my kal'ma were awakening to
its own shape. In time the images became beautiful, even caring. If
that is all...
TEAL'C
(turning to face her)
There is more.
TEAL'C
(emotionally)
I hate losing you a second time!
SHAUN'AUC
No, never more.
[They kiss passionately]
EXT-- CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--MORNING
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIP QUARTERS
[Teal'c is leaving Shaun'auc's room as Daniel is walking down the
corridor.]
DANIEL
Teal'c!
TEAL'C
(smiling)
Kell shah Daniel Jackson!
DANIEL
Morning, how's err Shaun'auc?
TEAL'C
The pain of carrying a symbiote past its time is extreme. Shaun'auc
bears it well.
DANIEL
I can imagine. Listen, I'm just heading off for breakfast...
TEAL'C
I am not.
[Teal'c moves to go in a different direction to Daniel.]
DANIEL
Err...could you stop walking?
[Teal'c stops and turns to face Daniel.]
DANIEL
(quietly)
Is everything all right?
TEAL'C
Yes.
DANIEL
You see, I've just noticed that you've been, you know, preoccupied
lately, obviously, and err I'm kinda going out on a limb here asking
but it's just that if you want to talk that I was here to talk...
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson!
[He grabs Daniel by the shoulder and Daniel looks at him surprised.]
TEAL'C
If all Jaffa can be taught to commune with their symbiotes then the
days of the Goa'uld are truly numbered!
DANIEL
And Shaun'auc can teach them?
TEAL'C
If Shaun'auc survives I intend to be at her side. If she does not I
will not allow her sacrifice to be in vain!
[Before Daniel can reply Carter comes running up to them.]
CARTER
Teal'c, we just got word from the Tok'ra. They've accepted
Shaun'auc's offer.
TEAL'C
When may we depart?
CARTER
Now, Colonel O'Neill's waiting for us in the gear up room.
[They walk away. Daniel looks worried as he follows.]
EXT-- VORASH
[SG-1 and Shaun'auc are met by some Tok'ra representatives.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[SG-1 and Shaun'auc enter via the ring system. Anise and two other
Tok'ra are waiting.]
ANISE
Shaun'auc of the Red Hills, welcome to Vorash.
SHAUN'AUC
It is a great honor to meet the Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
They're all right if you like the type.
ANISE
It is an equal pleasure to see you, Colonel O'Neill.
[She walks over to SG-1 and shakes Carter's hand.]
ANISE
(to Carter)
Your father asked that I shake your hand and give Colonel O'Neill a
big kiss from him.
[They all look surprised.]
CARTER
Err, that might have been the other way around.
O'NEILL
Maybe. Is Freya in there?
[Anise blinks and the host takes control.]
FREYA
Of course, Colonel.
SHAUN'AUC
Then it is true; host and symbiote share the body equally.
FREYA
And we are both pleased to tell you good news. As you requested,
Teal'c, one of our operatives has retrieved a newly spawned symbiote
to replace that which Shaun'auc offers.
SHAUN'AUC
(to Teal'c)
You have done this for me?
FREYA
Not only for you. If you truly have turned your symbiote to the
Tok'ra cause then your life is more valuable than any of ours!
[Shaun'auc closes her eyes and whispers to her symbiote.]
SHAUN'AUC
Kal'ma, it will not be long now.
TEAL'C
She has carried her symbiote far past its time.
FREYA
Then come, this way.
[They all follow Anise down a corridor.]
FREYA
We were able to find a host both willing and eager.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Eager too, huh?
[They enter a chamber where several people are waiting. Anise indicates
a man.]
ANISE
This is the volunteer host, Hebron of Paraval.
O'NEILL
(to Hebron)
Jack O'Neill, Earth. Err...forgive my bluntness here, but do you
have any idea what you are getting into?
ANISE
We have told him everything.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well I've noticed the Tok'ra have a tendency to leave out
minor details along the way sometimes.
(To Hebron)
You do know this thing's going to be in your head, right? You only
get your body part time?
HEBRON
My own people were enslaved by the Goa'uld a generation ago, I
understand what benefit may come of this.
O'NEILL
(unconvinced)
All right.
TEAL'C
This is Shaun'auc.
[Shaun'auc and Hebron look at each other.]
HEBRON
What can you tell me of the one with whom I will spend the rest of
my days?
SHAUN'AUC
That he wishes to forswear his birthright and desires to stop the
Goa'uld from causing any more harm.
HEBRON
Then we will have that in common.
SHAUN'AUC
You will share with him much, much more than I.
[She cries out in pain and collapses to the floor, supported by
Teal'c.]
SHAUN'AUC
I have waited too long!
TEAL'C
It must be done now!
ANISE
We are not yet ready for the transference.
SHAUN'AUC
It can wait no longer!
[Sounds of the symbiote emerging are heard. Carter, O'Neill and Daniel
grimace at the sight.]
SHAUN'AUC
Teal'c, it cannot wait!
[Hebron tears open his shirt.]
HEBRON
I am ready.
(he falls to his knees)
Take me!
[The symbiote emerges and O'Neill draws his gun. The symbiote lunges
for Hebron's neck and enters it. Hebron grasps at his neck and gasps.
He falls backwards. Shaun'auc passes out as Anise goes to Hebron. SG-1
stand back with a look of disgust at the process. Hebron's eyes open
and glow.]
ANISE
Colonel O'Neill, lower your weapon. The transference is complete.
O'NEILL
Transference, is that what you call that!
TEAL'C
(to Shaun'auc)
Shaun'auc?
[Anise helps Hebron to stand. He has a wound on his neck where the
symbiote entered.]
TANITH
There was no more time, Shaun'auc's life was in grave danger. I had
to act.
(to Anise)
Have you a prim'ta ready for implantation?
ANISE
Yes.
TANITH
Do it now, she is near death.
[Anise nods at a guard, who leaves.]
TANITH
I am Tanith, it is my honor to pledge my allegiance to the Tok'ra.
[Teal'c looks down at the unconscious Shaun'auc.]
INT--TOK'RA UNDERGROUND MEETING ROOM
[Carter and O'Neill are sitting at a table waiting for news. Daniel is
standing leaning against Carter's chair. Footsteps are heard
approaching and they all look up.]
DANIEL
How is she?
[Anise enters.]
ANISE
Shaun'auc is still very weak. The symbiote we were able to retrieve
was quite young.
CARTER
But she's going to be ok?
ANISE
We believe so.
[Tanith enters behind Anise. O'Neill eyes him suspiciously.]
O'NEILL
Hello, Hebron.
TANITH
He is here, Colonel O'Neill.
DANIEL
Actually, we'd like to hear that from him.
TANITH
Of course.
[He lowers his head and the host takes control.]
HEBRON
It is true, it is a strange feeling but I am very much here.
O'NEILL
How do we know that?
HEBRON
Tanith wants you to know that we will submit to any test you may
wish to perform to assure you that I am speaking freely as host.
Rest assured Tanith is pure of heart. Shaun'auc was indeed a great
teacher.
O'NEILL
Good, then maybe Tanith wouldn't mind sharing some of that fine
Goa'uld knowledge.
[Tanith takes over from Hebron.]
TANITH
(smiling)
Of course.
ANISE
When the time is appropriate.
O'NEILL
I think now is appropriate.
ANISE
I disagree.
O'NEILL
Oh, here we go, here we go!
ANISE
Tanith has asked to join the Tok'ra, not the SGC.
O'NEILL
(angrily)
Are you kidding me!
ANISE
We will gladly share what knowledge we feel is useful to the
furthering of our alliance with Earth.
CARTER
Does my father go along with this?
ANISE
I am sure he will.
O'NEILL
How do I hang up with Anise and talk to Freya?
ANISE
Why?
O'NEILL
I like Freya!
ANISE
She and I are in complete agreement.
O'NEILL
How do I know that?
ANISE
I have told you.
O'NEILL
And I'm supposed to trust you...You know this whole talking to two
people in one body thing really sucks!
[Teal'c and Shaun'auc enter the chamber. Tanith looks at Shaun'auc.]
TANITH
Shaun'auc!
[She looks at him and smiles.]
TANITH
It is good to finally see the face of she that taught me so much!
SHAUN'AUC
Oh, to speak with you in words, it is something I never dreamed of.
TANITH
There will be time for words. You must stay a while, we have so much
to talk about.
SHAUN'AUC
I know.
[Tanith looks at Teal'c.]
TANITH
Teal'c, I sense that she is still extremely weak.
TEAL'C
Her new symbiote is extremely young for the task of healing her.
[Tanith looks at SG-1.]
TANITH
I hope that your indecision did not put her at more risk than
necessary.
[Tanith smiles at Shaun'auc and then leaves the room. O'Neill puts his
hat on.]
O'NEILL
(annoyed)
I guess we'll just mosey on back to Earth. Tell General Hammond how
the Tok'ra boned us again.
[He leaves followed by Carter and Daniel.]
ANISE
Colonel!
[She follows him, as do Teal'c and Shaun'auc.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNEL
[O'Neill is leading SG-1 out of the tunnels, followed by Anise.]
ANISE
Please take no offense.
O'NEILL
Hey, we're getting used to it.
[They reach the transportation rings site. O'Neill, Carter and Daniel
stand ready to be transported.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, you can come back and visit Shaun'auc after we've debriefed.
(to Anise sarcastically)
That is if it's all right with our good friends and allies.
ANISE
He is welcome, of course.
O'NEILL
Swell...
(to SG-1)
Let's go.
[Teal'c looks at Shaun'auc]
TEAL'C
O'Neill, I would like a moment.
O'NEILL
We'll wait at the Gate.
[Carter, Daniel and O'Neill leave via the transportation rings.]
TEAL'C
I must inform the Tau'ri of my intention to leave their service.
SHAUN'AUC
I will await your return.
TEAL'C
We will return to Chulak and tell every Jaffa in every village of
your return.
SHAUN'AUC
Together!
TEAL'C
Tal matte, Shaun'auc.
SHAUN'AUC
Tal matte, my love!
[Teal'c leaves via the transportation rings.]
INT--TANITH'S QUARTERS IN TOK'RA BASE
[Tanith is looking at himself in a mirror. He turns around as Shaun'auc
enters the room.]
SHAUN'AUC
Have I disturbed you?
TANITH
The hour is late. You should be resting.
SHAUN'AUC
I could not wait to speak with you.
TANITH
Yes.
(He walks over to her)
We must speak of your audacity.
[Shaun'auc looks puzzled.]
SHAUN'AUC
I do not understand.
TANITH
How dare a priestess touch the mind of one who would be her god!
SHAUN'AUC
You despise the Goa'uld!
TANITH
(evilly)
I am the Goa'uld!
SHAUN'AUC
(shocked)
But I showed you the...
[Tanith clamps his hand over her mouth and grabs her.]
TANITH
You showed me the means to destroy the Tok'ra...
[She struggles in his arms.]
TANITH
Now accept your reward.
[Tanith's eyes glow and he smiles.]
EXT-- CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--NIGHT
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, Daniel and Hammond are sitting round the table. O'Neill is
standing near to his seat. Teal'c is standing at the end of the table.]
TEAL'C
It is with much sadness that I must take my leave of the SGC.
[SG-1 and Hammond look shocked.]
HAMMOND
Are you certain?
O'NEILL
He means leave of absence, sir!
TEAL'C
I have said what I mean, O'Neill. I intend to live the remainder of
my life on Chulak.
O'NEILL
What on Earth for?
TEAL'C
Do you not recognize the greatness of Shaun'auc's achievement?
DANIEL
I think the point is that if the whole idea was to get the secrets
of the Goa'uld into the hands of the Tok'ra...
O'NEILL
And us, by the way.
DANIEL
...Then it's done. Mission accomplished!
CARTER
Yeah Teal'c, even if you could train a large enough number of Jaffa
to communicate with their symbiotes, the Tok'ra have a hard enough
time finding hosts.
O'NEILL
But the point is you belong here!
TEAL'C
I belong where I am needed most, O'Neill, and that is on Chulak at
Shaun'auc's side.
[The sounds of the Gate activating are heard and sirens sound.]
TECHNICIAN
(on intercom)
Offworld activation!
[They all leave the briefing room.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Armed guards stand ready by the Gate. The iris is closed.]
INT--CONROL ROOM
[SG-1 and Hammond enter.]
TECHNICIAN
Incoming traveler, sir, it's the Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
Here to share squat with us no doubt.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[The iris opens and Anise steps through. She looks at Teal'c sadly and
then two further Tok'ra step through the Gate carrying a stretcher with
a body on it. Teal'c runs to the gateroom followed by the rest of
SG-1.]
ANISE
Teal'c, it is with great sorrow that I return.
[Teal'c looks at the stretcher.]
TEAL'C
Shaun'auc!
ANISE
We found the body just outside her chamber.
[Daniel, O'Neill and Carter look shocked.]
ANISE
The symbiote she carried was also dead. If we had found a more
mature larva...
TEAL'C
She appeared well!
ANISE
Shaun'auc's death is simply the unfortunate result of waiting too
long.
[Teal'c pulls down the sheet which covers Shaun'auc's face.]
TEAL'C
(emotionally)
Shaun'auc, Tal mek. Creon te shree. Tal mek.
DANIEL
(translating)
Our love does not end in death.
[Teal'c leans and kisses Shaun'auc.]
ANISE
(to O'Neill)
I wanted Teal'c to have the body for whatever spiritual ritual he
may wish to perform.
[Teal'c looks close to tears.]
INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
[Teal'c is meditating, surrounded by lit candles. He sees another
vision from his symbiote of his father's murder by Cronus. As Cronus
crushes his father's symbiote, Teal'c screams in pain. O'Neill is
walking down the corridor by Teal'c's quarters. He hears the scream and
rushes to knock on Teal'c's door.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[Inside his room Teal'c, suddenly opens his eyes.]
O'NEILL
(knocking on the door)
Teal'c!
[Teal'c opens his door.]
O'NEILL
What's up?
TEAL'C
Shaun'auc was murdered!
INT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
EXT-- VORASH STARGATE
INT--TOK'RA MEETING ROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter, accompanied by some Tok'ra guards. Anise and
two other Tok'ra are sitting round the table. They stand.]
ANISE
We have not yet obtained information of any value from Tanith. Your
return is premature.
O'NEILL
You folks should invest in some doors.
ANISE
We have no secrets from each other.
O'NEILL
I beg to differ with you!
TEAL'C
I have reason to believe the Goa'uld Shaun'auc carried was not truly
convinced to become a Tok'ra. I believe the Goa'uld used this
opportunity to become a spy among you.
ANISE
What evidence have you for this?
TEAL'C
The murder of Shaun'auc! The system lord Cronus murdered my father
by crushing his symbiote in such a way it allowed the symbiote's
blood to mix directly with that of my father. The method is slow and
immensely painful.
ANISE
How do you know this?
TEAL'C
In communion with my own symbiote. It is a vision my symbiote chose
to share.
ANISE
Why?
TEAL'C
To demonstrate Goa'uld hatred and superiority.
ANISE
Still, if that is your proof...
TEAL'C
We found Goa'uld blood in Shaun'auc's bloodstream and trace amounts
on her hands. Confirming my vision!
ANISE
And so you have come to exact revenge?
TEAL'C
(angrily)
I have!
ANISE
I'm sorry, we cannot allow you.
[They look at each other. Teal'c is furious. He lunges at the Tok'ra
next to him, knocks him over and runs from the room to seek out
Tanith.]
ANISE
Stop him!
INT--TOK'RA CORRIDOR
[Teal'c knocks down Tok'ra guards as he runs down the corridor
frantically. He is finally stopped by five Tok'ra and yells at them in
Goa'uld. O'Neill runs after him with his gun ready. He kneels down by
the distraught Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, we'll get the Goa'uld out of the host.
[Anise approaches.]
ANISE
No! He will be infinitely more valuable to us if we do not.
[Teal'c and O'Neill look at her suspiciously.]
O'NEILL
You knew!
[Anise blinks and the host takes control.]
FREYA
We suspected, but only after her death. Teal'c, we truly had hoped
Shaun'auc had succeeded, but if we allow Tanith to believe he has
deceived us we will be able to use that against the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
(still being restrained)
Disinformation.
FREYA
Yes, if we control what he sees and hears the Goa'uld will never
know our true intentions. We will be able to use that advantage for
months. When Tanith no longer serves a useful purpose we will
extract what Goa'uld secrets we can in other ways.
[O'Neill walks up to her.]
O'NEILL
What about the host?
[Anise takes control from Freya.]
ANISE
He knew well the risks. When we have learned all we can we plan to
remove the Goa'uld. We are fighting a war for our very existence. I
make no apologies for the means.
[Teal'c and O'Neill stare at her.]
ANISE
(to Tok'ra guards)
Release him.
[The guards let Teal'c go and he stands, clearly very angry.]
INT--TANITH'S CHAMBERS
[Teal'c enters with O'Neill and Anise following. Teal'c walks up to
Tanith with a grim look on his face. He stares at Tanith.]
TANITH
(slowly)
Hello, Teal'c. You must feel the pain of Shaun'auc's death as deeply
as I do. It is a terrible loss to both of us and has been
difficult...Why have you come to see me?
TEAL'C
To look upon you and know that Shaun'auc's sacrifice will not be in
vain.
TANITH
You have my promise. I hope one day we will meet again, Teal'c, and
together remember she who meant so much to both of us.
TEAL'C
We will meet again.
(He bows his head)
You have my promise.
FADE OUT
THE END
