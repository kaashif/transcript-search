TEASER
EXT--AIRBASE
[Carter, O'Neill, Daniel and Major Davis are standing on runway 18]
CARTER
Teal'c was ordered to push the envelope. I'm sure he'll be back
soon.
[O'Neill is looking up at the sky through binoculars.]
O'NEILL
Well, that'd be nice.
DANIEL
Where else would he go?
O'NEILL
Good point.
[A black Jeep pulls up.]
O'NEILL
Well, here we go.
[Carter stands to attention. Major Davis opens the car door. General
Hammond and General Vidrine get out of the Jeep which drives off.
O'Neill stands to attention and salutes. Vidrine salutes back.]
HAMMOND
Is there a problem, Colonel?
O'NEILL
No, Sir. Not at all. I'm sure Teal'c just felt he'd take her for a
spin...Around the world.
HAMMOND
Well, while we're waiting, I have someone who'd like to meet your
team.
DAVIS
Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Samantha Carter, Doctor Daniel Jackson,
allow me to introduce to you Lieutenant General Vidrine.
VIDRINE
Colonel.
O'NEILL
General.
VIDRINE
Major.
CARTER
General.
VIDRINE
Doctor.
DANIEL
General.
VIDRINE
General Hammond has told me nothing but good things.
O'NEILL
Has he, Sir? Well, then I'm sure he's left something out.
VIDRINE
Such as?
O'NEILL
(Speaking into radio)
Teal'c? Ya there, buddy?
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Look immediately to the southwest, O'Neill.
[They all turn. We see a Death Glider swoop over them at high speed. It
passes over them. sound of a sonic boom. They all duck. The glider
passes three feet over their heads.]
O'NEILL
WOOO-HOOO-HOOO!
VIDRINE
What in God's name is that?!
DAVIS
That, General, is the X-301 intercept.
O'NEILL
(speaking into radio)
Lookin' good, Teal'c. Give us another fly-by, low and slow.
TEAL'C
As you wish.
DAVIS
It's a hybrid craft, Sir, made with a combination of good ol'
American know-how, and two Goa'uld Death Gliders that SG1 recovered
a couple years ago.
VIDRINE
It may be the most impressive aircraft I've ever seen!
CARTER
Oh, it's more than that, Sir. Up till now, we haven't had a platform
from which we could launch an attack against a Goa'uld ship...now we
do.
[Glider makes a slower flyby.]
VIDRINE
What makes it fly?
CARTER
It's difficult to explain, Sir. The power plant doesn't exert force
against gravity so much as take inertia out of the equation. Even
pilots are immune to ordinary G-forces. We don't completely
understand the physics...
VIDRINE
Major, I'll just accept the fact that it flies.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
[Teal'c is having fun at the controls.]
EXT--GLIDER
[The glider makes another pass overhead.]
O'NEILL
Oh, it flies, yes, Sir!
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--AIRBASE
[O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, Teal'c, Hammond and Vidrine are still
standing on runway 18. Teal'c approaches with a helmet in his hand. The
Glider is behind him.]
VIDRINE
I always like to get a view of the man in the cockpit. How does she
fly, Son?
TEAL'C
The vehicle preformed within the expected parameters.
O'NEILL
WOO-HOO! Sorry, Sir. I couldn't help but get caught up in Teal'c's
enthusiasm.
DAVIS
Upon completion of a fight-test program, we hope to deploy the X-301
as an orbital defence craft under your command, Sir.
VIDRINE
In all seriousness, if that's all right with you, Colonel? How
effective can a single fighter be against a potential fleet of
Goa'uld warships?
TEAL'C
That is what these tests endeavour to determine.
VIDRINE
Let's find out. What's next?
O'NEILL
I take second seat for an air-to-air live fire test.
HAMMOND
Our SGC control room will serve as Mission Control, Sir.
VIDRINE
Light that candle, boys.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
[Teal'c and O'Neill head back to the glider.]
TEAL'C
Does General Vidrine wish to perform some sort of candle-burning
ritual?
O'NEILL
Yes, that's it, exactly.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Davis are seated at the control panel.]
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Request permission to proceed with weapon's test.
DAVIS
You're a go, Digger One.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
[Teal'c is in the front pilot seat, O'Neill behind and slightly raised
in the weapon's control seat.]
TEAL'C
Proceeding to target area.
CARTER
(over radio)
Copy that. You're a go for phase 2.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[We see a blip on a radar screen]
DANIEL
That's them?
DAVIS
The X-301 is equipped with stealth technology which normally
wouldn't show up on radar, so we've installed a special transmitter
for the test.
CARTER
These blips represent the target drones. X-301 is carrying 2
AIM-120A air-to-air missiles.
VIDRINE
Major, are you suggesting a slammer missile would be capable of
taking out a Goa'uld mother ship?
CARTER
If it's armed with a naquadah-enhanced warhead, and modified with a
shield frequency modulator, yes, Sir!
EXT--GLIDER IN FLIGHT OVER LAND
TEAL'C
Beginning attack run now.
O'NEILL
WOO-HOO-HOO!
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Digger One, you're going to overshoot!
[We see the words Tracking Failure appear on the radar screen.]
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
Uh...Teal'c? Target's back that way.
TEAL'C
I am no longer in control, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Excuse me?
TEAL'C
The craft is no longer accepting input from the controls. The drive
is at full power.
EXT--GLIDER IN FLIGHT HEADING INTO ORBIT
O'NEILL
Flight, I'm declaring an emergency.
TEAL'C
The ejection system has malfunctioned.
O'NEILL
We are no longer in control of the vehicle. I repeat, we have lost
control and can not eject. Please advise.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Digger One, Digger One? This is flight. They're not responding.
DAVIS
We're experiencing atmospheric interference.
VIDRINE
Major Carter?
CARTER
The glider was setting up to attack the target drones when it
accelerated into a steep vertical climb. It's off our radar, we're
attempting to require...
DANIEL
Are you saying they've gone into orbit?
CARTER
I'm saying they're headed straight out into space.
VIDRINE
You said the 301 was capable of space flight.
CARTER
Yes, Sir, it is, but that wasn't part of the test.
DANIEL
Teal'c wouldn't do this intentionally. There has to be something
wrong.
HAMMOND
A malfunction?
CARTER
Must be, Sir.
HAMMOND
Get me the shuttle action officer at space command.
CARTER
The shuttle won't be able to reach them, Sir, unless we can find
some way to turn them around.
HAMMOND
It's all we've got!
DAVIS
We're got NASA's deep-space tracking looking for the glider now.
With the DSP and NORAD data, they should be able to get a hack on it
and hopefully restore communication.
EXT--SPACE, ABOVE EARTH.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
Uh...flight, this is Digger One...Cheyenne, we have a problem!
Nothing's working back here.
[O'Neill looks out of the window. We see Earth getting smaller and
smaller behind them.]
O'NEILL
Uh...Teal'c, on our six. Is that what I think it is?!
TEAL'C
If you think it is Earth, yes.
O'NEILL
It's...shrinking.
TEAL'C
Its size remains constant, rather, it is we who are moving away at
extreme velocity. These instruments indicate drive shut down. We are
no longer accelerating.
O'NEILL
Well, that's good.
TEAL'C
I will Attempt to restart.
[Teal'c presses the start button and we hear]
VOICE OF Apophis
Shol'va! To all those who would turn against their god, know this!
For your insolence, you will die in the cold of space. What is
rightfully mine will now return to me!
O'NEILL
Was that who I think it was? And did he just say what I think he
said?!
TEAL'C
If you think it was Apophis, and if you think he said the device
from which this craft is constructed contains a device designed to
return this glider to his home world, then, yes.
O'NEILL
He also mentioned something about dying...
TEAL'C
In the cold of space.
O'NEILL
Right! Well, the ol' boy hasn't lost his touch, has he?
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
DANIEL
Digger One come in. Jack or Teal'c please respond. Nothing!
DAVIS
NASA Deep-Space tracking is trying to boost the signal.
DANIEL
General, maybe we should contact our allies capable of space flight.
Tell 'em our situation.
HAMMOND
Proceed, Doctor. SG2 will stand by to assist.
VIDRINE
How fast is the glider going now?
DAVIS
Roughly a million miles an hour, give or take. At least they're no
longer accelerating.
VIDRINE
George, maybe it would be best if I returned to the Pentagon. See
what our people can contribute from that end. You bring them home.
HAMMOND
Yes, Sir.
[Vidrine leaves.]
CARTER
Sir, I have an idea, but a whole lotta things have got to go right
for it to work.
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Cheyenne, we have a problem!
CARTER
Digger One, this is flight! Reading you five by!
HAMMOND
Why haven't they responded?
CARTER
We'll have to wait for it, Sir.
DAVIS
It's a time lag, Sir. The time it takes for our signal to travel
from earth to the X-301 and back.
INT--GLIDER, COCKPIT
O'NEILL
How are we on consumables?
TEAL'C
We have sufficient power and life support for several days.
O'NEILL
Several days? Well, that's something. How long will this thing take
to get to wherever it's going?
TEAL'C
Assuming this device is programmed to return to Apophis's home
world, several hundred years.
O'NEILL
Several hundred?
TEAL'C
Years.
O'NEILL
Yeah, just uh...let me do the math on that here. Carry the four...
TEAL'C
The instillation of this device was clearly the result of my
betrayal of Apophis. Before I became Shol'va, such a device would
have been unnecessary.
O'NEILL
So?
TEAL'C
I am indirectly responsible, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Oh, stop it. We'll be fine.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Digger One, come in.
O'NEILL
There, see?
DANIEL
Jack or Teal'c, please respond!
O'NEILL
Yeah, flight. Digger One, we read you. We have lost control of the
craft to some sort of recall device. That apparently, the
scum-sucking, slimy snake-assed Apophis installed in his death
gliders. Over! Flight, do you copy? Uh...flight. I don't know
whether or not you can hear me, but...uh...controls are not
responding. No thrusters and no reaction control system. We
are...purely ballistic. Over.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Colonel, you're so far out, there's already a time lag of a few
minutes, so conversation is going to be a problem. We've received
some preliminary tracking data from the deep space network. The
glider is going to pass relatively close to Jupiter. We're hoping if
we can somehow nudge your trajectory just a bit, you can perform a
sling-shot manoeuvre back toward earth. Message ends 1430 Zulu.
DAVIS
A time lag. Good thinking, Major.
CARTER
It would take a few minutes for our radio signal to get that far
out, even at the speed of light.
O'NEILL
(over radio)
...yeah, flight. Digger One...we read you...we have lost control of
the craft to some sort of recall device. That apparently...Apophis
installed in his death gliders. Over! Flight, do you copy?
Uh...flight. I don't know whether or not you can hear me,
but...uh...controls are not responding. No thrusters and no reaction
control system. We are...ballistic.
CARTER
Dammit! I was counting on them having at least some ability to
manoeuvre! I don't know how to swing them around Jupiter without
reaction control systems!
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
CARTER
(over radio)
We're hoping we can somehow nudge your trajectory just a bit, you
can perform a sling-shot maunder back to earth. Message ends 1430
Zulu.
O'NEILL
Message understood at 1433 Zulu. Okay! How do we do that?!
TEAL'C
Without control of our thrusters, we are incapable of nudging.
O'NEILL
Right. Uh, flight, this is Digger One. We have negative...nudging
capabilities. Stand by, flight. Teal'c, the weapons system we
installed shouldn't be affected, right?
TEAL'C
What are you considering, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Our missiles.
TEAL'C
At this velocity a great deal of thrust would be required to
significantly alter our trajectory.
O'NEILL
We just need a nudge.
TEAL'C
I am unsure of that specific measurement.
O'NEILL
Uh, flight. Digger One. We've got two AIM-120 Alpha rocket motors
that may, I'll say again, may, be at our disposal.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Uh, flight. Digger One. We've got two AIM-120 Alpha rocket motors
that may, I'll say again, may, be at our disposal. Can we over ride
the release mechanism and keep 'em attached through burnout? If so,
we'll need to calculate where, when, and duration of burn. Digger
One at 1458 Zulu.
HAMMOND
Major Davis?
DAVIS
They want to cook off the missiles, Sir.
HAMMOND
What for?
CARTER
If we can get enough Delta V out of the missiles' rocket motors, our
plan might still work. We'll need an over ride procedure. Can you do
it?
DAVIS
That's the easy part.
CARTER
Talk them through it. I'll need half an hour to make the burn
calculations, Sir.
DAVIS
Half an hour? Major, don't get me wrong, but the margin for error
for this...
CARTER
That's the time we've got.
DAVIS
I realize that! They thrust in the wrong direction, they hit
Jupiter.
CARTER
Wait any longer and we're too late. Sir?
HAMMOND
Do it.
DAVIS
Okay, missile selection switched to AIM-120A air to air mode to 4.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
Slow down, for cryin' out loud...
DAVIS
(over radio)
...you'll see an out of range message. Enter update and load the
figures I read you previously which will override the firing
inhibitors.
O'NEILL
Teal'c you getting' all this?
DAVIS
(over radio)
...at that point you will get a tone.
CARTER
(over radio)
Fire missile 2 followed by missile 1 at T plus 10. I know this
sounds like a lot, guys, but it's what we have to do. You can
commence at any point from 1622 Zulu. This is flight. 1618 Zulu.
O'NEILL
That's right about now. Whenever you're ready.
TEAL'C
Air to air mode bore.
O'NEILL
Update.
TEAL'C
Update.
O'NEILL
Ready. Flight, this is Digger One, we copy updates and are ready to
begin burn. Selecting...Missile 2. And...
EXT--GLIDER
[Missile 2 ignites.]
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
4--3--2--1--
EXT--GLIDER
[Missile 1 ignites. We see the glider fly close to Jupiter.]
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
[We see "Disengaging" on the weapon control screen in front of Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Weapons are releasing!
[Through the front of the glider we see one missile spin off ahead of
the glider, lose its burn and then tumble back toward the glider.]
EXT--GLIDER
O'NEILL
Look out!
[The missile strikes the glider.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Preliminary data coming in.
[We see the projected and actual path of the glider on the computer
screen.]
CARTER
Digger One, this is flight. We have no joy on the burn. I'm sorry,
Colonel, but the missiles just didn't have enough thrust. Your
current trajectory takes you out of the solar system and towards the
Oort cloud, which you should reach in a...in a few months. We're all
still thinking down here so...don't give up. 1813 Zulu.
EXT--GLIDER
[We see the glider passing by Jupiter.]
CARTER
(over radio)
We're all still thinking down here so...don't give up. 1813 Zulu.
O'NEILL
Cabin pressure's holding. We didn't spring a leak...though I may
have just...taken one!
TEAL'C
Our situation has indeed worsened.
O'NEILL
Ya think?!
TEAL'C
Indeed. The impact of the missile has damaged both power and life
support.
O'NEILL
I've always wanted to see the Oort cloud, so there's that. Flight,
this is Digger One. Failed burn caused damage to our power systems.
And life support.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel, Davis, Hammond, Tech and Carter are seated around the table]
DAVIS
No propulsion of any kind, and this attempt to change their course
has damaged both life support and power systems. For the moment,
we're recommending a complete shutdown of all nonessential systems.
DANIEL
Maybe there's a way they could disconnect or...or override what ever
it is that locked them out in the first place.
HAMMOND
It's worth considering.
CARTER
No, Sir, I don't think it is.
DANIEL
Why not?
CARTER
Well, it's logical to assume that there's also a failsafe mechanism
to prevent the pilot from attempting exactly that.
DAVIS
We don't know that for a fact.
CARTER
Yeah, but it makes sense. At this point, I recommend we concentrate
on ways to maximise life support.
DAVIS
The engineers who designed the craft are running scenarios now. They
can scrub CO2. But oxygen and power are going to be a problem now.
And it's going to get cold up there.
HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson?
DANIEL
The Tollan don't have a space craft fast enough, or close enough to
get there with in a year.
HAMMOND
And the Tok'ra?
DANIEL
Uh...yeah! I spoke with Anise personally. She said they had a scout
ship within a day or so of earth. Barely. But it's on a covert
mission to a Goa'uld-occupied world, and the High Council doesn't
want to expose their operative by...making...contact.
DAVIS
Then, why would they bother to tell you that much?
DANIEL
They hope that the operative will complete the mission and report
back in time to help Jack and Teal'c.
HAMMOND
I assume Anise refused to say where and what this covert mission
was.
DANIEL
And to understand not wanting to jeopardize the life of a Tok'Ra
important to both of us. I mean, I sort of lost my temper, but she
said she was doing us a favour by telling us as much as she did.
CARTER
Maybe she was. I mean, we know a scout ship's maximum speed from our
mission to Netu. We also know it's a Goa'uld-occupied world
relatively close to Earth, so...
DAVIS
So...that narrows it down.
CARTER
Yes, it does. Sir, with your permission...
HAMMOND
Granted!
INT--GLIDER, COCKPIT
TEAL'C
Navigation...off. Fire control systems...off.
O'NEILL
Targeting computer...off.
TEAL'C
Illumination to minimum setting.
O'NEILL
Is that all we can shut down?
TEAL'C
The radio, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Right. Flight, this is Digger One at one-niner 52 Zulu. We have
initiated power conservation and will have to terminate the
downlink. We'll reconfigure for a comm. pass five minutes before and
after every hour.
DANIEL
(over radio)
This is flight. Hold tight, guys. We got a new plan. We're trying to
reach you with a Tok'Ra scout ship. Message ends at...What time is
it? Uh...1947 Zulu.
O'NEILL
Uh...flight, Digger One, we would prefer to do something. Tell us
how to fix this thing, we'll fly ourselves home.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Oh! If you're thinking of trying to disconnect the recall device,
Sam thinks that would just make things worse.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
This is P2C-257. This is the only Goa'uld-occupied world which is
remotely within a scout ships range of Earth at maximum speed. The
Tok'ra operative must be there.
HAMMOND
What are the risks?
CARTER
Well, Sir. SG14 spent several days there observing the Goa'uld
mining operation. They managed to get in and out without being
detected. So can we.
HAMMOND
There's still the matter of identifying the Tok'ra operative.
CARTER
Anise said it was someone important to both of us.
DANIEL
Someone we know.
CARTER
At least that's what we're hoping.
DANIEL
We know what the risks are, Sir, and we're ready.
HAMMOND
I can see that. You have a go.
CARTER
Thank you, Sir. Tell them to hang on, Sir. We'll get there.
EXT--GLIDER AROUND JUPITER.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
HAMMOND
(over radio)
Digger One, this is Hammond. Doctor Jackson and Major Carter are
procuring a craft fast enough to rescue you, but you're going to
have to hang on for another 24 hours. I know that sounds like a long
time, and I know you want to do something to get your selves out of
this, but the best thing you can do is conserve your energy. Hammond
out at 2100.
O'NEILL
24 hours.
TEAL'C
Our current power and life support will not last 12 hours.
O'NEILL
Let me do the math...
EXT--GLIDER IN DEEP SPACE.
EXT--PLANET, FOREST, NIGHT
[Carter and Daniel are crawling through the undergrowth. Carter watches
the Goa'uld around the pyramid using a night vision.]
CARTER
We may have to go in through the mine.
DANIEL
What about contacting the operative by radio?
[Sounds around them. Suddenly there's a light above them and the sound
of a ring transporter activating.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
[Daniel and Carter are transported in. They rise. Carter aims her gun
at a door that opens to reveal Jacob.]
JACOB
Are you out of your minds?! What the hell are you two doing here?!
CARTER
We were looking for you.
JACOB
Well, you better have a damn good reason because I was twenty
minutes away from detonating a weapon's grade shipment of Naquadah
that would have vaporised a sizable chunk of this planet! Now if I
hadn't spotted you two coming through the Stargate...
CARTER
You saw us?
JACOB
Yes, The ship was cloaked. 'Was' being the operative word. Now, they
know we're here.
CARTER
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c need your help.
JACOB
What happened?
DANIEL
They're stranded in a disabled glider headed into space.
CARTER
This was the only ship within range.
JACOB
Good enough. Well, let's go.
[Carter and Daniel exchange a glance before following Jacob.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
What is it, Major?
DAVIS
General, Sir, Major Carter and Doctor Jackson are now aboard a
Tok'ra scout ship being piloted by her father, Sir. We're
designating it Digger Two.
HAMMOND
I call that good news, Major. What's the problem?
DAVIS
We've only received the one coded message, Sir. Before they made the
jump into hyper space. Now, by my calculations, even at the scout
ship's top speed...Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c will be dead by the
time they arrive.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
What do you say we turn up the heat?
TEAL'C
We must conserve as much power as possible.
O'NEILL
By the way, I've done the math.
TEAL'C
As have I.
O'NEILL
So, what do you say we turn up the heat? It's cold in here.
TEAL'C
I am aware.
O'NEILL
You know, I've already done that...freezing to death thing, and it's
just not as enjoyable as it sounds. So, if we just consider there's
no chance...
TEAL'C
There is a chance.
O'NEILL
24 minus 12...
TEAL'C
If I placed myself in an extremely deep state of Kel'No'Reem, my
heart rate will decrease, and our oxygen requirement will be lowered
considerably.
O'NEILL
Who will I talk to?
TEAL'C
There is little to say, O'Neill. We have fought and won many battles
together. It has been an honour to serve the Tau'ri by your side. We
are brothers.
O'NEILL
Wow, that's uh...
TEAL'C
Is there anything you wish to say, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
What could I possibly say after that? Backatcha!
TEAL'C
If we are to die, we die well.
[Teal'c puts himself into a state of Kel'no'reem.]
O'NEILL
We could do better.

CARTER

JACOB
No kidding. We're at 132% of maximum speed. If we don't shake apart
first, we might just get there.
DANIEL
Is that wise?
JACOB
No!
DANIEL
Oh.
SELMAK
You did not know about the recall mechanism?
CARTER
Well, apparently, Apophis didn't need a recall device until Teal'c
planted the seeds of rebellion on Chulak. We didn't have a clue.
SELMAK
The devices are new, even to the Tok'ra.
CARTER
You could have told us!
SELMAK
You could have told us of your intentions.
DANIEL
Uh, yes, why didn't we?
JACOB
Same reason we didn't. Politics. So, how do you intend to get them
out the glider once we get there? I mean, there's no chance it'll
fit into the cargo bay.
DANIEL
We were hoping you could kinda...um, like...beam them out.
JACOB
Beam them out? What am I, Scotty?
CARTER
I have an idea, Dad. But Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c are going to
have to take a leap of faith.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
This is Digger One...1011...Zulu. Teal'c's meditating to conserve
oxygen...I'm trying to sleep, but it's hard. CO2 levels are high.
Headache...is bad. Send aspirin. I estimate...three hours. This is
Digger One.
INT--TOK'RA SCOUT SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[The ship is vibrating badly and there is the sound of metal under
strain.]
CARTER
What's wrong?
JACOB
Nothing's wrong. Not yet.
DANIEL
But there will be something wrong?
JACOB
Well, let's just say I'd like to stop for a second and make some
repairs, but this is not a particularly safe part of town to pull
over.
DANIEL
Oh.
JACOB
And, what were you thinking, anyway? Retrofitting a death glider?
You should have known better. The technology you're screwing around
with is way over your head!
CARTER
That is the most arrogant...! I can't believe that that just came
out of your mouth!
JACOB
Well, it's the truth.
CARTER
You of all people should know!
JACOB
I am uniquely qualified to know just how technologically infantile
the human race is.
CARTER
Infantile?!
JACOB
Yes, in comparison with the Goa'uld and Tok'ra, you're very young.
CARTER
You...you are so...
JACOB
There's nothing wrong with being young, but you've got to learn to
take small steps. You can't just slap a US Air Force sticker on the
side of a death glider and call it yours. Advancement like that has
to be earned.
DANIEL
Um, aren't the Goa'uld, and the Tok'ra, for that matter, uh...where
they are by stealing the technology from other races?
CARTER
Yes!
JACOB
Yes, but the Tok'ra were flying around in ships like these when most
of the people on earth thought it was flat.
[Sound of an explosion.]
CARTER
What's that?
JACOB
What I was afraid of. We've overtaxed the drives.

Are we still in a bad part of town?
JACOB
The worst. We can probably get the drives back online, but it's
going to take a few minutes.
DANIEL
Excuse me? Is that what I think it is?
EXT--SPACE
[Two Goa'uld motherships are visible close by.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
CARTER
Can we cloak the ship?
JACOB
No. All main power systems are off line. Can you speak with the
Goa'uld dialect?
DANIEL
The dialect, yes.
JACOB
That's all you need. When they try to make contact with you, place
your hand here, and just use your imagination. Take your hand away,
and it'll broadcast. Sam, can you give me a hand?
[Carter and Jacob leave the flight deck. Daniel takes the pilot seat.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Davis is sitting at the radio, his head in his heads.]
O'NEILL
(over radio)
...trying to sleep, but it's hard. CO2 levels are high.
Headache...is bad. Send aspirin. I estimate...three hours. This is
Digger One.
DAVIS
Shall I respond, Sir?
HAMMOND
Do we have any new information to pass on?
DAVIS
No, Sir. Not since Major Carter reported they boarded the scout
ship.
HAMMOND
Let the man try to sleep.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
INT--SCOUT SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
GOA'ULD 1
(over communicator)
Kree tal shal mak! Heru'Ur!
DANIEL
Mak tal shree! Lo tak meta satak Oz!
GOA'ULD 2
Mak Tal Shree! Lok tak Meta satak Oz.
GOA'ULD 1
Mok Tal Oz?!
DANIEL
Mak Tal Oz kree!
GOA'ULD 2
Mak Tal Oz kree!
GOA'ULD 1
Kal tek shree, tak monak!
JACOB
All right, we're almost finished. Sam's just finishing.
DANIEL
Um, that's good, because I don't think they bought my act.
JACOB
Why? Who'd you say you were?
DANIEL
The er...great and powerful Oz!
JACOB
Sam!
CARTER
Almost there!
JACOB
We've got to go!
CARTER
Punch it!
EXT--SCOUT SHIP JUMPING INTO HYPERSPACE BEING CHASED BY GLIDERS
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
It's been almost 3 hours. I'd like to send a final message to
Colonel O'Neill.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
CARTER
(over radio)
Flight, Digger Two. We are in the solar system, and preparing for
retrieval. We estimate our time to station keep with Digger One is
four minutes. Stand by. We're trying to contact with Digger One,
Sir, so far without success.
EXT--GLIDER
[We see the scout ship pull up nose-to-wing with the glider]
CARTER
(over radio)
Digger One, this is Carter. Do you read?
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Are we too late?
CARTER
I think they're unconscious.
DANIEL
Well, we have to wake them up somehow.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
CARTER
(over radio)
Dammit, Colonel! We haven't come all this way to take you home in a
box, now wake up!
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Let me give them a nudge.
EXT--SCOUT SHIP
[The scout ship nudges the glider.]
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
CARTER
(over radio)
Colonel O'Neill?
[O'Neill looks around. He is disorientated.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
[O'Neill looks out of the window and sees the scout ship.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Yes, Sir!
O'NEILL
Hi!
CARTER
Hi, Sir. We're going to find a way to get you back home safe and
warm. What's your reserve oxygen status?
O'NEILL
Uh...I don't...what?
CARTER
What's your reserve oxygen status?
O'NEILL
Carter, is that you?
CARTER
Sir, we're over here ready to bring you home. But you're going to
have to trust me. He's suffering from anoxia, oxygen deprivation. Do
you trust me, Sir?
O'NEILL
Sure!
CARTER
Good! Is Teal'c conscious?
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[O'Neill throws a piece of metal at Teal'c]
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Look, it's Carter! She wants to talk to you!
TEAL'C
Major Carter. Little oxygen remains.
CARTER
Cabin pressure?
TEAL'C
Also very low.
CARTER
We copy that. So we want you do exactly what we say. First, remove
your restraints. Then on my mark, blow the canopy of the glider and
push off.
TEAL'C
We will die!
CARTER
Negative! It'll be all right if it's only for a few seconds.
JACOB
Teal'c, the only way we can bring you aboard is with the ring
transporter. That means you have to be clear of the glider. You got
it?
TEAL'C
I understand.
JACOB
Good. I need you at least 5 meters from the scout ship, close
together. Stand by until I get into position.
O'NEILL
Jacob, is that you?
JACOB
Yes, it is, Jack. Now do what we tell you.
O'NEILL
Do you know your ship's bigger than ours?
CARTER
Colonel, we need you to concentrate.
O'NEILL
Blow the canopy.
CARTER
On my mark, not before.
O'NEILL
Right!
CARTER
Make sure your helmets are secure and set your oxygen at 100%.
You'll need to pre-breath the last of it in breaths in deep breaths
holding each one in. You'll need to power the system before you blow
the canopy. Then disconnect the umbilical and exhale as much as
possible. Stand by!
EXT--SPACE
[We see the scout ship taking position over the glider.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
We're in position. Stand by in the hold.
CARTER
Colonel, Teal'c? Are you ready?
O'NEILL
Ready!
CARTER
Three...two...one...mark!
EXT--GLIDER
[The canopy of the glider blows off. O'Neill and Teal'c float up into
space. The scout ship cargo doors open. O'Neill and Teal'c are picked
up by the transport rings.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP, HOLD
[Carter looks back to see O'Neill and Teal'c appear in the ship scout
ship. O'Neill and Teal'c collapse to the floor. Daniel rushes to them
and crouches next to O'Neill.]
DANIEL
They're all right!
CARTER
Flight, this is Digger Two. We have Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c
aboard! They're both alive.
[Carter rises and back to Teal'c and O'Neill.]
CARTER
Welcome aboard!
[O'Neill reaches for Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Hey...Jacob...Thanks for stopping by!
JACOB
What the hell? I was in the neighbourhood! Ya need a lift home?
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir. Thank you.
[They all look at one another, relieved. O'Neill smiles up at Daniel.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Davis and Hammond are listening to Carter's message. They raise their
hands in relief and the Control Room erupts in cheers. Davis and
Hammond shake hands, smiling ear to ear.]
DAVIS
Yeah! Well done, Digger Two, well done! Congratulations! Now come on
home!
