   EXT--CHULAK, A LARGE OPEN TENT, DAY

   [A number of Jaffa priests are beginning a ceremony, using a Goa'uld
   larva in a large glass jar. Teal'c enters, wearing armor and carrying a
   staff weapon. A young boy, seemingly unconscious, is lying on a bed.
   The priests uncover a Goa'uld pouch on the boy's stomach. Suddenly, the
   scene changes to an adult Teal'c lying on the bed. One of the priests
   is holding the larva, obviously preparing to implant Teal'c.]

     PRIEST
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c starts to struggle and is held down by the other priests.]

     PRIEST
     Teal'c.

   [The larva is seen entering Teal'c's pouch as Teal'c yells. The little
   boy is seen walking around the tent, looking around at Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c! Rya'c!

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Teal'c wakes suddenly, obviously distressed.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c! Rya'c!

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Carter are in the observation room, looking down
   on Teal'c. Fraiser is in the room with Teal'c, dressed in surgical
   scrubs and wearing a mask.]

     O'NEILL

     (via microphone)
     Teal'c!

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c!

   [Fraiser walks up to Teal'c's bedside.]

     FRAISER

     Easy! It's okay now.
     (to SG-1)
     He's coming around.

   [Teal'c slowly becomes conscious, while the rest of SG-1 look down on
   him, very concerned.]

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld within me?

     O'NEILL

     (via microphone)
     They had to put Junior back in, Teal'c.

     FRAISER
     We almost lost you. The drug didn't work, Teal'c. I'm sorry.

     DANIEL

     (via a microphone)
     You were calling out something--Rya'c. Does that mean anything?

     TEAL'C
     It means nothing.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Fraiser is briefing SG-1 and Hammond.]

     FRAISER
     As soon as we removed Teal'c's goa'uld, his major organs began to
     shut down and he ran a high fever.

     HAMMOND
     So the drug failed?

     FRAISER
     Yes. But it proves that the Goa'uld is Teal'c's immune system. Now,
     if we can learn about it and safely duplicate its effect, we can
     save lives on Earth.

     DANIEL
     Without killing Teal'c in the process.

     HAMMOND
     Well, I guess the boys in Langley won't be able to study a Goa'uld
     after all.

     TEAL'C
     It is still a possibility.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, you can't. You don't have an immune system without your
     Goa'uld. We can't play with your life like that.

     TEAL'C
     There are many hundreds of Goa'uld larvae on Chulak.

     HAMMOND
     Chulak?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, right...you're kidding. Right?

     TEAL'C
     It is one of the few worlds in all the galaxy with such an
     abundance.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, but Teal'c, uh...if you recall, last time we were there...

     O'NEILL
     ...we had to shoot our way out. Maybe made a bad impression...

     HAMMOND
     It's out of the question. I can't authorize it.

     TEAL'C
     Then I will speak of it no further.

   [Appearing somewhat perturbed, Teal'c rises and walks out of the room.]

     HAMMOND
     Dismissed.

   [Hammond exits to his office. O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Dr. Fraiser
   rise.]

     DANIEL
     What was that?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know. I'll find out.

   [O'Neill leaves the room.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

   [A candle is burning. There is knocking at the door. The door opens and
   O'Neill enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Mind if I...

   [Teal'c is silent, but glances at O'Neill, making O'Neill
   uncomfortable. Teal'c is sitting cross-legged on the floor, with a
   semicircle of candles in front of him.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [O'Neill enters and shuts the door. Teal'c is staring straight ahead.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, um, I'm sorry if I didn't...

   [O'Neill gestures and pauses.]

     O'NEILL
     You do understand why we can't go back to Chulak, right?

   [Teal'c looks up at O'Neill with a raised eyebrow as O'Neill shrugs.]

     O'NEILL
     They'll get that drug to work long before that thing dies inside
     you.

     TEAL'C
     I am not concerned about my life. I am concerned for the life of my
     son.

     O'NEILL
     Your son?

     TEAL'C
     His name is Rya'c. I have not spoken of him, or of my wife.

   [O'Neill looks surprised and sits at Teal'c's desk.]

     O'NEILL
     You left...a family back there?

   [At Teal'c's non-reaction, O'Neill places his head in his hands.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you told the G--no, you swore to the General you had no ties
     back there. Why didn't you tell us the truth?

     TEAL'C
     A warrior becomes vulnerable if his family is held hostage to the
     enemy.

     O'NEILL
     You didn't think we'd trust you if we knew? Teal'c, how the hell are
     we supposed to trust you now? Huh? You got any more surprises?

     TEAL'C
     With or without you, O'Neill, I must return to Chulak.

     O'NEILL
     Either way it's suicide, my friend.

     TEAL'C
     Within days, my son will come of age. He will be called to the
     religious life of our world. He will undergo the ceremony of
     implantation. The Primta. The day when a young boy receives his
     first Goa'uld symbiote, and becomes a true Jaffa. Just as all other
     Jaffa before him.

     O'NEILL
     I take it you don't want that to happen?

     TEAL'C
     It is the means by which the Goa'uld enslave the Jaffa. I am not the
     only one among my people who believes this. My first teacher, the
     Jaffa Master Bra'tac, he knew very well the Goa'uld are false gods.
     But I can not...I will not allow my son to become a slave.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel, Carter, and O'Neill are meeting with Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     Absolutely not.

     CARTER
     With respect, Sir, we've considered the risks.

     HAMMOND
     You have, have you?

     DANIEL
     Yes, and we are all behind Teal'c, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I can see that. What I can't see is why.

     CARTER
     We believe there's more to be gained from this mission than a single
     larval Goa'uld.

     HAMMOND
     Such as?

     DANIEL
     The warrior Jaffa class are the foundation of Goa'uld power; they
     serve as both incubators for their young and as their army. An army
     made almost invulnerable by the restorative powers of the Goa'uld
     larva they carry. I mean, it's, it's literally a Faustian bargain.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c claims there are other Jaffa who believe in freedom from the
     Goa'uld as much as he does.

     CARTER
     Imagine the strategic advantage, sir, if we could undermine the
     loyalty of the very group the Goa'uld depend on to maintain their
     power.

     HAMMOND
     How many of these other jaffa can you be sure of?

     O'NEILL
     We're pretty sure of at least...one guy.

     HAMMOND
     One?

     DANIEL
     Yes, and, and where there's one there has to be more than... one.

     HAMMOND

     (dubiously)
     Oh absolutely. Colonel, would you join me in my office a moment?

   [Hammond gets up and leaves.]

     O'NEILL
     Sure.

   [O'Neill follows.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill walks in. Hammond is still standing.]

     HAMMOND
     Shut the door.

   [O'Neill closes the door.]

     HAMMOND
     Have a seat, Jack.

   [O'Neill sits, as does Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     This is not my first barbecue, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     I'd love to get a Goa'uld larva that the lab coats at Langley can
     study, but I don't order my best people on a mission behind enemy
     lines unless I think it's absolutely necessary.

     O'NEILL
     I believe it is, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Why? There's something you're not telling me Colonel. If you don't
     want to come clean about the real motivation behind this mission,
     then fine. The mission is not approved. You will go where I tell you
     to go.

     O'NEILL
     Sir, please...

     HAMMOND

     (yelling)
     Dismissed!

   [O'Neill looks through the window to Carter and Daniel and then
   stands.]

     O'NEILL
     General, Teal'c has a son.

     HAMMOND
     What did you say?

     O'NEILL
     Back on Chulak. His kid's about to be implanted with one of those
     larva things, at a ceremony, and Teal'c wants to stop it.

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     Why, Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c was an enemy soldier. He's compromised.

     O'NEILL
     General, he was afraid we wouldn't trust him if we knew he had a
     family back there. Was he right? When Teal'c saved our lives on
     Chulak, he gave up his family, Sir. Don't you think we owe him
     something?

   The klaxons blare. O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Hammond run down the
   stairs to the control room.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Teal'c is in his Serpent Guard uniform dialing the Stargate himself.]

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c!

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing?

     HAMMOND
     Stand back from the keyboard.

     TEAL'C
     I am returning to Chulak for my son.

     HAMMOND
     No. I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.

   [A couple of SFs appear, guns cocked and pointed at Teal'c. O'Neill
   steps towards Teal'c as Daniel and Carter look on, concerned.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on Teal'c, don't do it this way.

     TEAL'C
     I will risk no one's life but my own. Why will you not let me
     return?

     HAMMOND
     You know far too much about this command, this facility, our
     defenses. I can't let that kind of knowledge fall into enemy hands.

     TEAL'C
     I will die before allowing that to happen.

     HAMMOND
     Dammit Teal'c, that's just what's going to happen if you go through
     that 'gate alone.

   [Teal'c and Hammond stare at each other.]

   HAMMOND
   Which is why I am inclined to authorize a mission to return to Chulak
   and allow you to bring your son back.</blockquote>

   [Teal'c stops the dialing sequence.]

     TEAL'C
     Thank you, General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     When is this ceremony supposed to happen?

     TEAL'C
     Within the day.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate engages. SG-1 enter the room disguised as priests while
   Teal'c is in a Serpent Guard uniform.]

     CARTER
     Daniel? The glasses.

   [Daniel removes his glasses and puts them inside his cloak. They walk
   up the ramp.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill? I am in your debt.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, it's nothing.

     TEAL'C

     (to the assembled SGC personnel and Hammond.]
     We shall return.

   [Teal'c's helmet closes.]

     O'NEILL
     Ready to ship out, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Godspeed Colonel.

   [SG-1 walk through the 'gate.]

   EXT--CHULAK, DAY

   [Waiting on the other side are priests and Jaffa. The Jaffa have staff
   weapons aimed at the new arrivals. The priests walk up to Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     These are scholars from the court of Apophis. I am to escort them to
     the temple.

     PRIEST #1
     Why do you not show your face, my lord?

     TEAL'C
     My helmet was damaged in combat. It must be repaired.

     PRIEST #1
     Perhaps I can help.

   [He reaches towards the helmet but Teal'c grabs his hand.]

     TEAL'C
     Nemet, kree! You dare touch me, priest?

   [The priest falls to his knees, in obvious pain.]

     TEAL'C
     I shall tell Apophis of your vigilance, priest. You shall be
     rewarded.

   [He lets go of the priest, who stands up. Teal'c marches off, and SG-1
   follow.]

   EXT--FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [SG-1, who are back in uniform, are hiding the robes under some bushes
   and rubbing off the temporary marks of Apophis from their foreheads.]

     TEAL'C
     We will go directly to my former home. The ceremony should take
     place there.

     O'NEILL
     All right Teal'c, show us the way.

   [SG-1 walk down a slope towards a clearing containing a burnt-out
   building. Teal'c runs up to it as they near.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, is this your...?

     TEAL'C
     My former home. A gift from Apophis for many years of service.

   [Teal'c walks around to the rear and sinks to his knees, distressed,
   and begins to cry. A large sword/serpent mark has been painted on the
   side of the building. The rest of SG-1 come up to Teal'c's position.]

     DANIEL
     What does this mark mean? I don't recognize this.

     TEAL'C
     This was the home of shol'va.

     DANIEL

     (to O'Neill and Carter)
     Traitor.

     O'NEILL
     Well, it looks like this happened a long time ago.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, there's no reason to believe your wife and son were in the
     house when this happened.

   [Teal'c gets up and goes inside, smashing at the burnt wood. He is
   obviously devastated by what he has seen. O'Neill approaches him, as do
   the others.]

     O'NEILL

     (somewhat at a loss)
     Teal'c, Carter's right. You don't know what's happened here.

   [A man suddenly appears, placing his staff weapon against O'Neill's
   neck.]

     BRA'TAC
     Obi tan! Shree! Shree! Shree!

   [Teal'c comes outside.]

     TEAL'C
     Tek matte Bra'tac.

   [Bra'tac looks at Teal'c in surprise, lowers his weapon, and smiles.]

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     It is good to see you, friend.

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac embrace.]

     BRA'TAC

     (admonishing)
     Were I an enemy, you would be dead.

     TEAL'C
     My wife and son?

     BRA'TAC
     I am told they escaped the burning. I thought you might return in
     time for your boy's ceremony, Teal'c. Brave, but unwise.

     TEAL'C
     If you were awaiting my return, perhaps there are others?

     BRA'TAC
     Others don't know you as I do. But I expected you to come alone.

   [He looks around at the others. Daniel and Carter approach the group.]

     TEAL'C
     They are friends. Colonel O'Neill. Captain Carter. Daniel Jackson.
     Warriors of great skill and cunning.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Oh, Teal'c, that's...

     TEAL'C
     My first teacher, Bra'tac. The greatest Jaffa master I have ever
     known.

     O'NEILL
     It's an honor to meet you, Sir.

   [Bra'tac walks to O'Neill but ignores him, going to Carter instead.]

     BRA'TAC
     You, you are among the warriors who defeated the palace guard at
     Chulak? A human woman?

     CARTER
     Hey, I'll have you know I kicked my...

   [He moves on to Daniel.]

     BRA'TAC
     And you? A warrior of great skill and cunning?

   [Bra'tac grabs Daniel's wrist and puts his mouth around his hand, as
   though to bite it.]

     BRA'TAC
     I could snap you like kindling! How could you bring these hashack
     with you?

     O`NEILL

     Hey! Hey! Hey! Who you calling a hassock?
     (turning to Daniel)
     What's a hassock?

     BRA'TAC
     You challenge me hashack?

     O'NEILL
     Ah, no. I don't think we came to fight you.

     BRA'TAC
     A shame.

   [He turns and swings back around to knock O'Neill with his staff
   weapon. O'Neill grabs the weapon and knocks Bra'tac to the floor,
   ending with with the staff poised pointed at Bra'tac's head.]

     O'NEILL
     We're here on a mission. If you don't want to be a part of it, just
     say so.

   [Bra'tac laughs.]

     BRA'TAC
     You choose your friends well, Teal'c. Though were I a hundred years
     younger, it might not have been quite so easy.

     O'NEILL
     You're over a hundred years old? God, I'm sorry.

   [O'Neill reaches down to help him up but Bra'tac grabs him and throws
   him to the ground.]

     BRA'TAC
     A hundred and thirty three.

     O'NEILL
     You must work out.

   [Bra'tac reaches to help O'Neill up.]

     BRA'TAC
     No one has ever defied the Goa'uld and lived to tell of it. There
     was much talk in Chulak of the warriors of Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Really?

     TEAL'C
     Our time here is limited. Can you take us to find my wife and son?

     BRA'TAC
     Your family is kreshta. Outcasts. The kreshta live in a handful of
     camps outside the city. I do not know which one your family belongs
     to.

     TEAL'C
     Then we should begin now.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I will not leave Chulak without seeing my son.

     O'NEILL
     Captain, I want you and Daniel to go back to the Stargate, take up
     positions where you can lay down cover fire. We might need it.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

     DANIEL
     Ah, a minute ago we were warriors of great skill and cunning.

     O'NEILL
     Wait there for us for 24 hours. If we're not back by then, we
     probably won't be.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir. We'll be waiting. Good luck, Sir.

   [Daniel and Carter walk away.]

     TEAL'C
     If we are discovered, you will be brought before Apophis along with
     us.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it.

     BRA'TAC
     No. The bridge is too well guarded.

     O'NEILL
     No, actually there, I was using a cliché that...

     TEAL'C
     Kal shak my friend. Honor us with your guidance.

     BRA'TAC
     We go south. Those camps nearest the city. I believe your wife would
     go there.

     TEAL'C
     I agree.

   [They walk off leaving O'Neill standing.]

     O'NEILL
     South is good.

   [He follows.]

   EXT--ROAD THROUGH FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Hey Teal'c! Maybe Bra'tac's feeling a little tired, might want to
     take a little rest...

     BRA'TAC
     You will follow. Teal'c and I will lead.

     O'NEILL
     No, no, no. Actually you see, I'm in charge here.

     BRA'TAC
     The Stargate is well patrolled. Your deceptions will not work a
     second time. You need my help to stay alive, human.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, all right. Whatever, I'm easy.

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c tells me your world is without gods. Difficult to imagine.

     O'NEILL
     Well it's not without gods. A lot of people believe there's a god.
     Not everyone believes in the same god, the same way but...let's just
     say nobody believes in anyone with glowing eyes and a snake in his
     head.

     BRA'TAC
     Then you serve no one?

     O'NEILL
     I serve the SGC under a General Hammond.

     BRA'TAC
     So this Hammond is...

     O'NEILL
     Just a man. A very good, very bald man...from Texas.

   EXT--ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [Carter and Daniel are making their way through the trees.]

     CARTER
     Poor Teal'c. What he must have gone through keeping quiet about his
     family.

   [Carter stops Daniel quickly and they duck. A procession of priests and
   priestesses is passing. Two of the priests are carrying a heavy
   container.]

     DANIEL
     Jaffa priests. That's Apophis' emblem.

     CARTER
     What are they carrying?

   [Suddenly, a bell tolls.]

     CARTER
     What's that?

     DANIEL
     It's a bell.

     CARTER
     As in a church bell?

     DANIEL
     Probably.

     CARTER
     I haven't been to church in a while.

   [Daniel and Carter follow the priests.]

   EXT--ROAD THROUGH FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Bra'tac walk to an overhang overlooking the camp.
   People scream and run into shelters as they see the Jaffa uniforms.
   Teal'c notices a tent on the far side of the camp. He runs down through
   the village towards the tent.]

   EXT--OPEN TENT, DAY

   [Inside a priest is holding a glowing hand device over Rya'c's stomach.
   Teal'c bursts in.]

     TEAL'C
     Priest! Stand aside!

     PRIEST #2
     Teal'c. The traitor.

   [The priest goes to pick up a knife.]

     PRIEST #2
     You dare to show yourself, shol'va?

     TEAL'C
     I have no wish to harm you, priest.

   [Teal'c drops his weapon and raises his arms to the side.]

     TEAL'C
     But I will not allow you to perform the Primta on my son.

   [The priest attacks Teal'c who fights back. A hooded person enters the
   tent and jumps on Teal'c's back. Teal'c pushes the priest away, who
   falls on a table smashing the bowl containing the Goa'uld. Teal'c
   restrains the other person and removes the hood. It is a woman.]

     WOMAN
     Teal'c.

   [O'Neill and Bra'tac arrive.]

     O'NEILL
     And this would be?

     TEAL'C
     My wife. Drey'auc.

   [Drey'auc gets up and looks over at the priest. O'Neill goes to him and
   turns him over. He has fallen on his knife and is dead, as is the
   larva.]

     DREY'AUC

     (to Teal'c, furious)
     I had to beg the priest to perform the ceremony! They bought the
     tablet and the tent for the primta all the way to camp. Why have you
     returned?

     TEAL'C
     My son will not be a slave, Drey'auc. He will taste freedom. As I
     have.

   [O'Neill lifts the larva from the floor, checking that it is dead.]

     DREY'AUC
     Freedom, Teal'c? You have condemned your son to death.

   EXT--FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [O'Neill and Bra'tac drag the priest away from the tent.]

   INT--TENT ON CHULAK, DAY

     DREY'AUC
     Your heresy is an abomination, Teal'c. Even by the outcasts I am
     shunned.

     TEAL'C
     The abomination is my people enslaved by the Goa'uld.

     DREY'AUC
     How can you call the gods that you served for so long, your enemy?

     TEAL'C
     Since the Earth people opened my eyes. The Primta is slavery.

     DREY'AUC
     Did you see where I am raising your son? Is this better than the
     home that Apophis granted you as first prime?

     TEAL'C
     It is not.

     DREY'AUC
     You have abandoned and betrayed us. Do you know what I have endured
     to convince the priests that we are still loyal? They were about to
     lift the banishment so that we could return to the city!

     TEAL'C
     So you want this more for yourself than for our son?

   [Drey'auc hits Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     I will speak to him.

   [Teal'c tries to wake Rya'c as Drey'auc fights to remove Teal'c's hands
   from the boy.]

     DREY'AUC
     No, no. He believes you are dead!

     TEAL'C
     Dead?

     DREY'AUC
     It is easier than the truth.

   [Teal'c grabs Drey'auc by the hair.]

     TEAL'C
     What have you told him, woman?

   [She pulls away from him.]

     DREY'AUC
     What would you have me tell him? That a father left his son for
     people he does not know? Who are not his blood? You tell him that,
     husband; you witness the dishonor in his eyes.

     TEAL'C

     (pleading)
     Drey'auc...

     DREY'AUC
     Come. Carry your son back to the hovel that has become his home.

   [Teal'c carries Rya'c in his arms.]

   EXT--FOREST ROAD LEADING TO LARGE CLEARING, DAY

   [The priests and priestesses appear at the clearing, followed by Carter
   and Daniel, who are hiding from them. The procession goes to a small
   building, where one of the priestesses fills a vessel with liquid from
   the container and pours it into a tank. They then walk away. It is
   clear the tank is full of larvae.]

     CARTER
     We have to get a closer look.

   EXT--OUTSIDER'S CAMP, DAY

   [The camp is tattered and clearly very impoverished. Rya'c is lying on
   a bed in a makeshift tent, coughing. His face is blotchy and red.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c? Rya'c?

   [Rya'c opens his eyes.]

     RYA'C

     (smiling)
     Father?

   [Teal'c holds his son's hand as Rya'c coughs.]

     RYA'C

     (to Drey'auc)
     I knew he was not dead.

     TEAL'C
     How long has the sickness been in him?

     DREY'AUC
     Since we were driven from our home. Do you understand now? Without
     the healing powers of the Goa'uld, he will die.

     TEAL'C
     What have I done?

   [O'Neill and Bra'tac arrive.]

     O'NEILL
     How's he doing, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     He is dying.

     O'NEILL
     I'm no doctor, but I know scarlet fever when I see it.

   [O'Neill takes a small envelope from his vest.]

     TEAL'C
     Can it be treated by your Earth medicines?

     O'NEILL

     There's some vaccines, antibiotics.
     (to Drey'auc)
     Give me that water.

   [He pours some powder into the drinking vessel and stirs it with the
   empty packet.]

     O'NEILL
     Give that to him.

   [She does.]

     DREY'AUC
     I thank you.

     O'NEILL
     It won't cure him, you know. It'll take more powerful drugs than
     I've got with me.

     TEAL'C
     What of your Earth doctors?

     O'NEILL
     If we can get him through the Stargate, maybe.

   EXT--SMALL TEMPLE IN CLEARING, DAY

   [Carter and Daniel are having a closer look at the larvae in the glass
   container.]

     DANIEL
     Bingo. Goa'uld larvae.

     CARTER
     Here in the open like this, no guards?

     DANIEL
     Well, who on Chulak needs to steal one?

     CARTER
     We do.

     DANIEL
     Right.

   [Carter passes her MP5 to Daniel and gets out a thermos-style flask.]

     CARTER
     Okay, we can do this.

     DANIEL
     I'm ready.

     CARTER
     Okay. On three. One, two, three.

   [Carter doesn't put her hand into the larvae liquid.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, on four.

     CARTER
     Four.

   [Carter quickly puts her hand in and grabs a Goa'uld larva, pushing it
   into the flask, cringing the entire time.]

     CARTER
     I really, really, really hate these things.

   [She puts the flask into the larva liquid to fill it, then puts the lid
   on.]

     CARTER
     Okay, come on.

   [Daniel doesn't follow, but cocks and raises the MP5.]

     CARTER
     Daniel? What are you thinking?

     DANIEL
     Just that every single one of these infant Goa'ulds will one day
     take a human life. And all I have to do is...

     CARTER
     If we kill them when they are as vulnerable as they are right now,
     we'd be no better than the Goa'uld. Let's go.

   [Carter turns and Daniel follows. He then turns back and fires on the
   tank. The Goa'uld's spill out, squealing. Carter looks at Daniel,
   obviously shocked, and takes the MP5 from him. They leave the
   clearing.]

   EXT--FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [Bra'tac, Drey'auc, Teal'c and O'Neill move through the forest, with
   Rya'c in his father's arms.]

     DREY'AUC
     He is burning.

   [They come to a small, clear part of the forest.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter and Daniel should be here.

   [Teal'c puts Rya'c on the ground. Drey'auc checks on him.]

     DREY'AUC

     (crying)
     Oh, he no longer draws breath, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c. Rya'c.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c. We should try to make it to the Stargate.

     TEAL'C
     By then it will be too late. There is another way.

     DREY'AUC
     No, no, no.

   [Teal'c starts to remove his armor.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you wanna think about this? You can't live for more than a
     couple of hours without that thing.

     BRA'TAC
     It is a father's right.

     DREY'AUC
     What of you, Teal'c?

   [Tearful, Teal'c bends down and opens Rya'c's clothing.]

     TEAL'C
     I am sorry, my son, that it is I who must do this to you. But I do
     it to save your life.

   [Teal'c's symbiote comes out of his pouch and enters Rya'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Forgive me, my son. Forgive me.

   EXT--ROAD IN FOREST, DAY

   [Daniel and Carter are walking briskly along. Daniel is eating a
   chocolate bar.]

     DANIEL
     Do you think these things need to be fed?

   [A staff blast hits a nearby tree. They see a group of Jaffa coming
   after them from behind.]

     CARTER
     Go, go!

   [The Jaffa chase them, and Carter and Daniel take cover behind a large
   tree. Daniel throws away his chocolate and pulls out a gun. The Jaffa
   are firing continuously.]

     DANIEL
     What the hell do we do now?

     CARTER

     (pulling a pin from a grenade)
     Drop and cover your head. This is going to be close.

   [Carter gets up and throws a grenade in the Jaffa's direction. They
   cover up and it explodes, killing the Jaffa.]

     DANIEL
     Well, that was insane.

     CARTER
     Let's get back to the Stargate.

   [They leave.]

   EXT--SMALL FOREST CLEARING, DAY

   [Rya'c is lying on the ground, with Teal'c slumped against a tree.]

     CARTER

     (on radio)
     Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     Keep coming Captain, you're almost here.

     BRA'TAC
     The Goa'uld within him is strong. He's healing well.

     O'NEILL
     When will he be strong enough to travel?

     TEAL'C
     Soon. But by then, O'Neill, I will no longer be. Bra'tac.

   [Bra'tac goes to him.]

     TEAL'C
     I would have you hear my will.

   [Carter and Daniel walk up.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, let's just put a little hold on that right now.

     CARTER
     We'd better get moving, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     We've got a little problem. Teal'c's kid was too sick to make it to
     the Stargate so he gave him his own Goa'uld to keep him alive.

     DANIEL
     Ahh, we have one.

     O'NEILL
     You what?

     DANIEL
     We were gonna take it back with us, but...

   [O'Neill grabs Daniel and pushes him over to Teal'c, Bra'tac and
   Drey'auc.]

     DREY'AUC
     Praise the stars, we must hurry.

     CARTER
     We found what looks like a monastery.

     BRA'TAC
     You dare steal from the sepulcher of the temple?

     DREY'AUC
     It is sacrilege!

     O'NEILL
     Well, so what! Is it going to help him?

   [Daniel hands over the flask to Bra'tac.]

     BRA'TAC
     It is young. Not yet ready for implantation. But we will try.

   [Drey'auc lowers Teal'c to the ground, his head resting on her legs,
   and Bra'tac places the Goa'uld onto his stomach. Teal'c nearly cries
   out from the experience.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Other Jaffa come across the ones killed by Carter's grenade. One of
   them blows on a horn.]

   EXT--THE STARGATE, DAY

   [The priests and Jaffa at the Gate hear the horn.]

     PRIEST #1

     (to the Jaffa)
     Go!

   [The Jaffa leave.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Teal'c is carrying Rya'c as SG-1, Bra'tac and Drey'auc move through
   the forest.]

     O'NEILL
     How you holding up, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     My body grows strong again.

   [The horn blares again.]

     BRA'TAC
     We have been discovered.

   [Rya'c wakes up.]

     RYA'C
     Father?

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c.

   [Teal'c rushes them to the side of a tree then sits on his haunches,
   with Rya'c in his arms.]

     DREY'AUC
     Your father has given you life.

     RYA'C

     (happily)
     A Goa'uld?

     TEAL'C
     Your Primta. It is all I can give you until I return. Follow the
     guidance of Bra'tac and your mother, and you will learn to become a
     great warrior.

     RYA'C
     Stay.

     TEAL'C
     I cannot. But the day of my return will come.

     RYA'C
     When?

     TEAL'C
     It may be a very long time, my son. But the life of a Jaffa is long.
     I know the day will come when we will stand side by side in battle
     to free our people from the false gods. Remember, my son, remember.

   [Rya'c hugs his father and rises to go to his mother.]

     TEAL'C

     (to Drey'auc
     Blame me for the priest. Tell them I tried to steal your son away.

     DREY'AUC
     We will be all right, Teal'c. Go.

     TEAL'C
     My son is fortunate to have such a mother.

     DREY'AUC
     And his father will never return to free his people if he does
     not...go now.

   [Teal'c cries. The horns blare again.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, we gotta move.

   [SG-1 and Bra'tac leave, but Teal'c stops and turns back to see his
   wife and son once again.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Teal'c holds his Serpent Guard helmet while the rest of SG-1 find the
   priest robes which they had hidden earlier.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, here's the plan.

     BRA'TAC
     You will do as I say.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

     BRA'TAC
     You won't need those.

   [He takes the priest robe from Carter and throws it into a bush. They
   leave all the robes behind.]

   EXT--CLEARED PATH UPHILL, DAY

   [SG-1 come to the top of the hill and look down on the Stargate. Teal'c
   closes his helmet. SG-1 go down the hill following Bra'tac. A Jaffa
   guard and two priests see them coming.]

     BRA'TAC
     Behold my friends. The traitors.

     PRIEST #1
     Halt. Come no further.

     BRA'TAC
     I am to present my prisoners to Apophis himself.

     PRIEST #1
     You cannot pass, Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     You know of me?

     PRIEST #1
     Of course, Master. You were once the greatest Jaffa warrior of all.
     But no one may pass until the palace guard arrives.

     BRA'TAC
     I understand. Then we wait.

   [Bra'tac turns and fires his staff at their feet, igniting the ground.
   O'Neill and Carter draw their weapons to help but Teal'c stops them.
   Bra'tac knocks down the Jaffa and both priests. One priest comes up
   behind him and he knocks him out again.]

     BRA'TAC
     Not bad for a man of a hundred and thirty-three.

     O'NEILL
     Not bad at all. Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [Daniel goes to the DHD to dial out.]

     CARTER
     What will you do? When the priests come to, they'll tell Apophis
     that you betrayed them.

     BRA'TAC
     I suppose, I will cross that bridge when I come to it.

   [He smiles at O'Neill. Carter and O'Neill move to the Stargate.]

     TEAL'C
     I lack the words to thank you, Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     I thank you, Teal'c. I have another young warrior to teach of new
     worlds.

   [The Gate engages. Bra'tac places his arm on Teal'c's shoulder.]

     BRA'TAC
     Farewell, my friend.

     TEAL'C
     Farewell.

   [Teal'c joins Carter, O'Neill and Daniel on the steps to the Stargate.]

     O'NEILL
     Ten hut.

   [O'Neill and Carter salute and Daniel waves. They then go through the
   Stargate. Teal'c waits, raises his staff weapon in salute and follows.
   As Bra'tac walks away, the Gate shuts down.]
