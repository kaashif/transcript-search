in front of him.]

I take it the anti-Prior device is working?

Well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.

What the hell is going on?

I had to be sure this was working on her first.

INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
[The rustic pub is crowded and noisy. Vala is playing a sort of card
game across a table from a man. It is similar to poker but is played
with marked triangular pieces instead of cards.]
GAMBLER
You're bluffing. You have nothing.
VALA
Hmm.
[She takes a drink from the metal tankard beside her.]
VALA
I'll tell you what. I'll bet you everything I have on this table
against that cargo ship of yours outside.
GAMBLER
Your winnings wouldn't cover the value of that ship.
[She uncovers a large bracelet on her left forearm; it is a Sodan
cloaking device.]
VALA
What if I throw in this?
GAMBLER
And what's that supposed to be?
[She touches her right index finger to the device with a flair. She
quickly fades into invisibility, to the gasps of the onlookers around
her. After a moment she reappears, smiling proudly.]
GAMBLER
You've got your wager. As foolish as it may be.
[She puts the device in the middle of the table and pushes all of her
"chips" to the center as well. The gambler turns over all his pieces to
reveal three of one symbol and two of another. He smiles smugly as if
certain he can't be beaten. Vala moves her left hand a bit then flips
over her five pieces: she has four of a kind. The gambler slams his
hand on the table in disappointment.]
VALA
(smiling grandly)
I guess it's just my lucky day.
[She reaches for all the winnings in the pot, but the gambler grabs her
hand. A man behind her points a gun at her head. Others are gathered
around.]
VALA
(irritated)
I thought this was an honest establishment.
GAMBLER
It is. And that's why it's necessary to have you searched.
[The make Vala stand up. A man shakes out her sleeve, and several card
pieces fall out onto the table, proving she has been cheating.
Immediately six more guns are pointed at her head by other men.]
VALA
I don't suppose we could call this even...
[The guns suddenly fly out of the mens' hands. Then the men themselves
are pushed to the side of the room, clearing the path to the door.
Adria is there, and she enters, smiling.]
VALA
Adria.
ADRIA
Hello, Mother. It's good to see you; it's been far too long.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
VALA
(shocked)
I did not expect to see you again.
[She sits down.]
ADRIA
I had to return, Mother. My work here is unfinished.
GAMBLER
Who is this?
VALA
(dramatically)
You really don't wanna know.
[The gambler signals for others to attack Adria. She sends them all
against the wall of the pub.]
ADRIA
Get out. All of you!
[The patrons all run out of the pub in panic, leaving only Vala and
Adria.]
VALA
I don't suppose you're gonna let me just walk out of here.
ADRIA
I'm afraid not. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mother, but your
attempt to destroy the Ori was unsuccessful.
VALA
Am I supposed to take your word for that?
[Vala starts putting her chips into her pockets.]
ADRIA
I've been personally supervising the construction of dozens of
ships. Now that our intergalactic gate is operational again, there's
nothing to stop them from coming here. We should have the entire
galaxy converted in a matter of months.
VALA
Just because you've been building ships, doesn't prove anything.
ADRIA
What are you doing here? Where are your friends from Earth?
VALA
(sadly)
Friends come and go.
ADRIA
(sitting on the edge of the table)
Have they abandoned you?
VALA
(chocked up)
I'd rather not talk about it.
[Vala reaches again for the pile of chips in the pot, but Adria
mentally shoves her back into the chair.]
ADRIA
I really must know, Mother.
VALA
You do realize, in a traditional mother-daughter relationship, I'm
supposed to be the bossy one.
(defeated, sad)
Oh, whatever. It makes no difference now anyway.
FLASHBACK
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[At his table, Daniel is writing in a notebook filled with his notes,
sketches, and some Ancient writing. An Ancient book is nearby, along
with a parchment and stacks of books. Vala comes running in and stops
beside him, putting her hand on his shoulder. She appears to be in her
nightclothes, which are covered by a light robe.]
VALA
I've got it! I've figured it out.
DANIEL
(dubious)
Got what?
VALA
The answer you were looking for, to the the- Clava The-thessaurasi
thingamajigamy.
DANIEL
The Clava Thessara Infinitas?
VALA
Right, that's the one.
(smiling at him and touching his hand)
I know where it is.
[Daniel looks rather amazed.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is briefing Landry and the rest of SG-1 in front of a large
screen. The image shows a circular tablet with a square hole in the
center.]
DANIEL
The Clava Thessara Infinitas, literally, "the key to infinite
treasure", is the Ancient tablet Athena was seeking from Qetesh.
Now, supposedly it holds the clues to the whereabouts of a vast
storehouse of Ancient weapon technol--
[As Daniel has been speaking, Vala has been sitting forward in her
chair, smiling in pride at Teal'c, across the table from her. Now she
interrupts Daniel.]
VALA
(in a loud stage whisper)
Psst! Daniel, this is very interesting. Get to the good part!
[Daniel clenches his jaw in frustration.]
LANDRY
The good part?
VALA
I figured it out. I know where the treasure is.
CARTER
(skeptical)
You solved the Clava Thessara Infinitas?
VALA
(proudly)
Yes, I most certainly did.
[Vala hops up and rushes to the front of the room. She takes the screen
remote control from Daniel, who rolls his eyes.]
VALA
Daniel shared some of his findings with me last night before I went
to sleep. And after a rather, well, nasty dream in which I appeared
on a television program where it seemed you had to dance with
supposedly well known personalities in front of a panel of
judges...a shape came to my mind.
[Close up, the tablet is shown to have Stargate glyphs on it. Vala hits
the remote control, and a graphic infinity symbol appears horizontally
on the tablet, overlaying the picture.]
CARTER
The symbol for infinity.
VALA
Yes. Infinite treasure. Infinity. You see? And it intersects with
six symbols, which, when combined, correspond with...
[She pushes the remote. The glyphs through which the infinity symbol
passes are highlighted and appear in boxes at the bottom of the
screen.]
VALA
...a gate address.
CARTER
Why would the Ancients use the Earth symbol for infinity to hide
their treasure?
DANIEL
Actually, no one knows the exact origin of the symbol itself. It's
been found on Tibetan rock carvings dating back over a thousand
years, as well as a host of other places. For all we know, it could
well have originated with the Ancients.
[Vala sways back and forth happily.]
MITCHELL
You can rotate that symbol any which way you want.
VALA
Uh, yes, but this is how it appeared in my dream, and when we put
these six symbols into the database, it came up with only one
address.
MITCHELL
Why does this all sound familiar?
TEAL'C
Mmmm. Did Adria not send you information in dream form to lure us to
the planet where the Sangreal was hidden?
VALA
(holding up her hands in disagreement)
Hmm, yes, but no, this is different. I came up with this on my own.
CARTER
Okay, I suppose it is possible that Qetesh knew its location and
this is simply a latent memory being dredged up by Athena.
[Daniel waves at Carter is if to say that is Vala's explanation.]
VALA
There you go.
LANDRY
Do we have any idea what this Ancient storehouse actually contains?
DANIEL
No idea, sir, but it must be big if Athena was so eager to get her
hands on it.
VALA
I feel very strongly about this, General...
(at his reaction)
What can it hurt to send a team?
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
ADRIA
(sincere, interested)
I didn't send you that information!
VALA
(voice quivering)
That's what I tried to tell them, but they didn't believe me,
especially when the reconnaissance team returned.
FLASHBACK
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM AND GATE ROOM
[The gate is active, the klaxons sounding. Daniel and Vala join Landry
in the control room.]
DANIEL
What is it?
LANDRY
SG-3 and 8; they're coming in hot. Open the iris.
[The technician opens the gate. Weapons fire comes through the gate,
hitting the wall below the control room. Daniel flinches from the
blasts. The row of SF's fire back. Six men come through the gate, one
helping an injured man. Reynolds is the last of the six.]
REYNOLDS
(signaling to Landry)
They're right on our tail! Shut the gate! Shut it down! Shut it
down!
LANDRY
Do it!
[The gate shuts down.]
LANDRY
Med teams to the gate room immediately!
[Landry leaves, followed by Daniel and Vala.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The men make their way to the bottom of the ramp, Reynolds last.
Landry, Daniel, and Vala rush in.]
LANDRY
What happened?
REYNOLDS
(breathing heavily)
It was an ambush, sir. Ori soldiers made our position as soon as we
stepped through the gate. I lost two men. Couple more injured.
VALA
That's not possible. That can't be.
[He moves toward Vala angrily. Vala steps back behind Daniel, who
raises his hand a bit to warn off Reynolds.]
REYNOLDS
(bitterly)
You tell that to the men who died.
LANDRY
Colonel!
[Reynolds turns toward Landry.]
LANDRY
Debrief in my office.
REYNOLDS
Yes, sir.
[He glares at Vala as he passes her.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
VALA
I was so certain that I was right, I couldn't leave well enough
alone. And the very next night...
FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Vala is at the front of the room with the tablet graphic from before,
showing the horizontal infinity symbol.]
VALA
I had the same dream again, only this time, the infinity shape
appeared vertically rather than horizontally.
[The graphic changes accordingly, showing the symbol vertical with six
different glyphs than before.]
VALA
Note that again it intersects with six symbols and that again, the
six symbols only match one address in our database.
[Landry sighs and stands, unimpressed.]
VALA
What?
[Landry walks through the door to his office.]
VALA
What's the problem? We need to investigate this.
MITCHELL
(not looking at her)
Vala.
VALA
What?
MITCHELL
Do you not see what's going on here?
VALA
No.
MITCHELL
This is Adria telling us where to go so she can pick us off.
CARTER
Next you'll have a dream where the symbol's on a slight angle, and
I'll bet it will still correspond to one single gate address. She's
using you, Vala.
VALA
No. I would know.
MITCHELL
Well, you didn't know before...did you?
[Mitchell walks out on her, followed by Carter and Teal'c. She smiles
expectantly at a somber Daniel. After a moment, he gets up and leaves,
too.]
VALA
(voiceover)
Things just got worse from there.
INT--VALA'S VIP ROOM
[Vala sits on the bed, rocking, worried. Daniel is let in by a guard.
He looks somber, worried and reluctant.]
VALA
Daniel, what's happening?
DANIEL
It's not looking good. Most of the IOA delegates think you've been
compromised.
VALA
But I didn't do anything wrong; I was trying to help.
DANIEL
It doesn't matter what your intentions were. If Adria can manipulate
you like this any time she wants to, then you become a security
risk. They're talking about removing you from the team.
VALA
(meekly but shocked)
What?
DANIEL
They're also not comfortable with the idea of letting you go, given
everything you've learned about Earth's defenses.
VALA
I don't understand.
DANIEL
They're talking about confinement, Vala. At Area 51.
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
[Adria studies Vala; she looks sympathetic.]
VALA
You don't believe me, either.
ADRIA
You can't lie to me, Mother. I can read the truth in your mind. I'm
just surprised.
VALA
So was I.
ADRIA
How did you convince them to let you go?
VALA
I didn't. That's the funny thing.
FLASHBACK
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[In near darkness, Vala enters.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I guess they thought a locked door could hold me.
[She goes to a large metal cabinet and opens it. She takes the Sodan
cloaking device and puts it on.]
VALA
(voiceover)
Or they never imagined I'd make it off the base.
[She makes herself invisible.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The gate is active, and a team of marines heads up the ramp to leave.
Invisible to everyone, Vala follows them up the ramp. She is wearing
BDU's but has nothing with her by way of equipment. She gives a quick
look back, then goes through.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUB ON ALIEN PLANET
ADRIA
(truly concerned)
What do you plan to do now?
VALA
Well, I had just won myself a cargo ship when you dropped by and
broke up the game, so...
[She sputters her lips at the futility.]
ADRIA
Is that really what you want? A life alone, always on the run? That
life no longer suits you, Mother -- you belong with me. Return with
me to my ship and take up your rightful place as mother of the
Orici!
[Vala has stood up and is preparing to leave.]
VALA
(intensely)
Adria, stop it! I am not your mother. I may have given birth to you,
but we are not family. So, stop pretending.
[Adria stands.]
ADRIA
(smiling over slight panic)
You just need time to think about it. We'll talk further, on our
way.
VALA
(shaking her head in disbelief)
Where are we going?
ADRIA
To find the Clava Thessara Infinitas.
VALA
You think it's real?
ADRIA
I think that Colonel Carter was right. This might be knowledge from
your time as a Goa'uld being dredged up through your subconscious.
VALA
Well, you're too late. Despite the fact that they didn't trust me,
they thought that they should check out the second gate address,
anyway, just to be safe. I overheard them planning the mission as I
was leaving.
ADRIA
Yes, but there's something you're not telling me.
VALA
(falsely)
I don't know what you're talking about.
ADRIA
(stern, threatening)
Don't play games with me, Mother! If I have to force this
information out of you, it will be quite unpleasant.
VALA
They were worried about an ambush, so they're taking a ship.
ADRIA
We can beat them if we travel by Stargate. Let's go. Now!
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
EXT--SECOND GATE ADDRESS PLANET, DAY
[Adria and Vala come through to find the rest of SG-1 and some marines
waiting for them, armed.]
MITCHELL
Howdy!
[Adria smiles, and both women start down the steps. The gate shuts
down. Adria lifts a hand as if to take some action. Nothing happens.]
MITCHELL
You didn't really think we'd invite you to a party and not disable
your funky powers, did ya?
[Adria turns angrily to Vala.]
VALA
(to Adria)
I have no idea what's going on.
DANIEL
Don't worry, Vala, it's all part of the plan.
VALA
(angry and hurt)
Don't you ever speak to me, ever again!
[Suddenly many Jaffa arrive via beaming. They outnumber the SGC
personnel. Both sides aim weapons at each other.]
JAFFA
Lower your weapons!
MITCHELL
Buddy, I think you got the wrong planet.
JAFFA
Lower your weapons, or we will all perish. My master, Lord Ba'al,
has targeted this location from orbit.
[Mitchell lowers his P-90, signals to the others, and they do the same.
The Jaffa walks over to Adria and puts a device on her upper arm.]
MITCHELL
What are you doing?
JAFFA
Carrying out my orders.
[He, Adria, and the rest of the Jaffa beam out.]
DANIEL
Okay, that wasn't part of the plan.
INT--HOLDING AREA ON BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[Adria and the Jaffa beam aboard. The Jaffa removes the band from her
arm. Ba'al is waiting for them. There is a large cage-like jail cell
sitting in the middle of the room. It's made of metal bars.]
BA'AL
Welcome! Don't waste your time. I've learned a thing or two from our
Tau'ri friends. This room is being flooded with the same kind of
E.M. field they generate with that clever little device of theirs --
the one that prevents you from using your mind powers.
[Adria is standing at the open door into the cell.]
ADRIA
You should know that won't hold me forever.
BA'AL
(chuckling)
Of course not.
[The Jaffa forces her into the cell, and Ba'al closes the door.]
BA'AL
But that won't be a problem...after I'm done with you.
EXT--SPACE ABOVE PLANET
[Ba'al's ship jumps into hyperspace.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28
[Landry, Mitchell and Teal'c leave the gate room and walk together.]
MITCHELL
They got the jump on us; we had no time to react.
LANDRY
Exactly how did Ba'al manage to pull this off?
MITCHELL
I don't know, but they had detailed intelligence.
TEAL'C
He was aware of both are locations and intentions.
MITCHELL
Bigger question is, what does Ba'al want with Adria?
TEAL'C
Perhaps he intends to negotiate for shared control of the galaxy.
LANDRY
She doesn't strike me as the sharing type.
MITCHELL
Either way, we do not want those two hanging out together.
LANDRY
Exactly. We have to get her back.
[The have come to a stop at the end of the corridor.]
MITCHELL
We're on it, sir.
[Mitchell starts to walk away, but Landry calls to him and stops him.]
LANDRY
Wait! How's Vala?
MITCHELL
Pissed.
LANDRY
Somebody gonna fill her in?
MITCHELL
Absolutely. Just not us.
[Teal'c bows slightly to Landry, and he and Mitchell walk away.]
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM
[Vala sits at a table. Carter is across from her, and Daniel is perched
on the edge of the table to her left. There is a closed laptop, a TV
remote control and a large device on the table. There is a TV on a cart
next to the table.]
VALA
(subdued, not looking at Daniel or Carter)
This isn't right, you know. I escaped fair and square. You bringing
me back here is tantamount to kidnapping!
DANIEL
Listen, we know you're upset, but you have to understand, this was
part of a plan.
VALA
Upset? Why would I possibly be upset? Maybe because I was betrayed
and abandoned by the only people in the entire galaxy I thought were
my friends. Don't be silly!
CARTER
We are your friends, and we did not betray you.
VALA
You didn't exactly back me up now, did you?
DANIEL
What she means is, none of it actually happened!
VALA
(angry and animated)
What are you talking about?
CARTER
(indicating large device on table)
This device is a slightly altered version of the memory implant
technology we received from a race called the Galarans. We used it
to create a fictional memory and implant it in your mind.
[Vala huffs and crosses her arms in annoyance.]
DANIEL
We knew you'd have trouble understanding all of this, so we took the
liberty of making a recording before you underwent the procedure.
Look.
[Carter has started the video using the remote control. The TV shows a
time-stamped playback of a video of Vala in the briefing room.]
[Video Vala is putting on lipstick for the camera.]
VIDEO VALA
(nearly unintelligible while putting on the lipstick)
Tilt it up a little. All right. Oh yeah. Thank you. Now, I can see.
VIDEO DANIEL
(annoyed)
We're rolling!
[She finishes the lipstick.]
VIDEO VALA
Oh, oh. Oh, we're on. Why didn't you say so?
[She starts chewing the gum in her mouth.]
VIDEO DANIEL
Gum.
[She takes the gum out of her mouth and hands it to Daniel, then licks
her fingers.]
VIDEO VALA
Thanks.
(to camera)
Hello, gorgeous.
[The 'real' Vala waves back.]
VIDEO VALA
If you're watching this, you're obviously back at Stargate Command
and you are probably thinking that everyone around you has gone
completely
(gesturing with her hands)
wonko.
[The 'real' Vala says "Wonko" at the same time as video Vala.]
VIDEO VALA
With the possible exception of Daniel, who, let's face it, was
always a little bit...
[She makes a doubtful grunting sound.]
VIDEO DANIEL
Vala!
[The 'real' Daniel drops his head.]
VIDEO VALA
Sorry. Um, seriously, though, substituting our memories was my idea.
Brilliant, I know and incredibly brave! But it was the only way for
the plan to work. So, if you are watching this, you have obviously
made it back. And let me be the first to say, "well done," and
(speeding up to get the words in)
enjoy the substantial pay rise that's been promised to you if the
mission succeeds.
[While video Vala speaks, 'real' Vala smiles and appears very proud of
herself.]
VIDEO DANIEL
(quickly, to stop her)
Okay, that's enough. Thank you. Thanks, I got it. Good.
[Daniel gives Carter a "wind things up" signal, and she hits to remote
to stop the playback.]
CARTER
We heard that Adria had returned through the Supergate. Now, if the
Ori are dead, we thought we might be able to convince her to leave
quietly with her army.
DANIEL
We knew that she'd be able to tell if you were lying to her, so as
far as you were concerned, it wasn't a lie.
VALA
(becoming upset again)
I escaped using a Sodan Cloak. You allowed me to be exposed to
radiation so that you could carry out your plan!
CARTER
Uh, your plan, and, no, that was also part of the false memory. We
escorted you to the planet where Adria found you, and we dropped you
off.
DANIEL
You slept through it like a baby.
[Vala furrows her brow in concentration and realization.]
VALA
So...no IOA?
(Daniel shakes his head negatively)
No Reynolds men?
(Daniel again shakes his head)
No television program about dancing with supposed celebrities?
DANIEL
Actually, that part was real.
VALA
How very disturbing.
DANIEL
(agreeing)
Mmmm.
CARTER
Yeah.
INT--HOLDING AREA ON BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[Adria paces inside the cage. Her Celestis pendant and cloak have been
taken from her. Two Jaffa stand guard at the exits. Ba'al enters with
more Jaffa and approaches the cage.]
BA'AL
Comfy?
ADRIA
You made a terrible mistake. Release me now, and I will be merciful.
BA'AL
You're so much more pleasant when you lack the ability to snap my
neck with your thoughts.
ADRIA
You're a fool! Dealing with powers way beyond your means! When my
army catches up to you--
BA'AL
Don't waste your breath! Your army has no idea where you are, and
it'll be days before they even begin to question your disappearance.
Even then, all their queries will lead them...to the Tau'ri.
ADRIA
If you intend to kill me, you should know the Ori will not halt
their attacks on this galaxy.
BA'AL
I have no intention of killing you. As a matter of fact, my whole
plan hinges on your being very much alive.
ADRIA
So you can ransom me for your freedom.
[She steps close to the bars, in front of him.]
BA'AL
Far from it. You can offer me something far more valuable.
Control...of your army.
ADRIA
(chucking and smiling)
They'll never listen to you.
BA'AL
No. But they do listen to you.
ADRIA
There's nothing you can do to make me bend my army to your will.
[He leans in very close to her.]
BA'AL
(in Goa'uld voice)
Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that.
[His eyes glow. She stares at him with a tense expression.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Agent Barrett is standing next to Landry, who is holding some papers.
SG-1 enters.]
LANDRY
(to SG-1)
Agent Barrett has some information regarding Ba'al's whereabouts.
BARRETT
I got a call from one of my agents, undercover inside Ba'al's
operations here on Earth. Apparently, the clones are planning to
meet as a group.
MITCHELL
Where and when?
BARRETT
P3R-112. Today.
DANIEL
Not a lot of notice!
BARRETT
I just got the intel an hour ago.
MITCHELL
How reliable is it?
BARRETT
My guy's embedded at the top. He wouldn't break cover unless he was
sure.
CARTER
Well, we've been here before. We have a pretty good idea of the
layout.
LANDRY
(to Mitchell)
Take a Marine unit.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
EXT--P3R-112, DAY
[On a wooded planet, SG-1 approach a rock wall and take cover behind
them. They are overlooking the meeting place.]
MITCHELL
Kind of quiet spot for such a big meeting.
CARTER
I think that's the idea.
DANIEL
I'm not seeing a lot of movement.
[Mitchell looks through his binoculars to see a close-up of a tent
village. All over the ground are dead Jaffa, dressed in battle armor.]
MITCHELL
I think I know why.
[He hands the binoculars to Carter, who looks as well.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P3R-112, DAY
[SG-1 and the Marine unit walk through the decimated village, their
weapons ready.]
CARTER
Looks like somebody got here before us.
TEAL'C
Mmmm. No wounds, no sign of combat.
CARTER
Symbiote poison?
TEAL'C
I believe so.
VALA
Why would the Ba'als kill their own Jaffa?
DANIEL
(calling to the rest of the team)
I don't think the Jaffa were the intended target.
[He leads them inside a large tent. All around a large dining table are
dead Ba'als, slumped over, some with their eyes still open.]
EXT--SPACE
[Ba'al's mother ship travels slowly through normal space.]
INT--BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[A Jaffa carries a tank into the room where Ba'al is keeping Adria.]
BA'AL
Ah, at last, the guest of honor.
[Another Jaffa lifts the lid from the tank. Ba'al rolls up his left
sleeve, reaches into the tank, and pulls out a Goa'uld symbiote. It
screams and thrashes. Adria recoils in horror.]
BA'AL
You two are about to become very well acquainted.
[Adria breathes heavily in fear.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P3R-112, DAY
[More SGC personnel have arrived on the scene. Two carry away one of
the Ba'als on a stretcher. Daniel and Mitchell walk together through
the village, still holding their weapons.]
MITCHELL
Well, you gotta hand it to him. The man throws a mean dinner party.
DANIEL
Well he knows we're coming after him; he's covering his tracks.
TEAL'C
(joining them)
Indeed.
[The hear a zat activate and fire nearby. A Jaffa has emerged from the
woods, and it was he who fired. Daniel, Teal'c, and Mitchell raise
their weapons as do some Marines.]
JAFFA
Stand back, I'm warning you!!
MITCHELL
Just take it easy!
DANIEL
We're not gonna hurt you!
[Vala steps up behind the Jaffa and zats him.]
DANIEL
Much.
VALA
I thought they were all dead.
MITCHELL
Apparently not.
[Teal'c walks over to the stunned Jaffa and finds a tretonin syringe in
his armband.]
TEAL'C
(looking at the capsule)
And I believe I know why.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[SG-1 arrives through the gate as Landry strides into the room.]
MITCHELL
We've got a lead. Once he woke up, our Jaffa friend was surprisingly
forthcoming.
TEAL'C
He confirmed the fact that Ba'al was behind the attack that killed
all of his clones.
DANIEL
Apparently, he had assembled them for what they thought was a
meeting on the Adria situation.
VALA
Instead, he beamed in canisters of symbiote poison.
LANDRY
Quite the door prize.
MITCHELL
Yeah, whatever Ba'al's up to, he doesn't want any witnesses.
DANIEL
Lucky for us, he didn't realize one of his Jaffa uses tretonin.
LANDRY
Any idea where he is now?
CARTER
Actually, yes. The Jaffa was able to provide us with the coordinates
where Ba'al's ship is located.
LANDRY
The Odyssey is standing by. You move out again in one hour.
EXT--SPACE
[Odyssey travels through hyperspace.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 sits at the table with Colonel Davidson.]
DAVIDSON
Assuming for a moment this Jaffa is telling the truth and we
actually find Ba'al's ship, how do you propose we capture Adria?
MITCHELL
Same way he got her off the planet. We beam in, tag her and beam
out.
DAVIDSON
It's a big ship, Colonel. How are you gonna find her?
CARTER
Well actually, it shouldn't be that difficult. We're assuming Ba'al
has some sort of technology similar to our own anti-Prior device.
Otherwise she would have used her powers the instant he beamed her
on board. If we scan for those specific E.M. frequencies, we should
be able to pinpoint her location with a fair degree of accuracy.
DAVIDSON
All this pre-supposes that we get the drop on him and he doesn't
raise the shields.
MITCHELL
Yeah.
DAVIDSON
All right then. Good luck.
[He stands and leaves. SG-1 stands and they all begin to leave.
Mitchell remains next to the table, waiting for all but Vala to leave.]
MITCHELL
Vala. You got a sec?
VALA
Sure.
MITCHELL
You're welcome to sit this one out.
VALA
Why? I mean, why would I?
MITCHELL
You know why we're bringing Adria back, right?
VALA
Sure. To tell her to take her army and...clear off.
MITCHELL
And if she resists...we will take action.
VALA
By killing her.
MITCHELL
(surprised)
You're okay with that?
VALA
(certain)
Of course.
MITCHELL
All right.
[Vala nods quickly and leaves.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE
[Mitchell enters the bridge. Vala, Carter, Teal'c, and Daniel are
standing forward, looking out of the viewscreen.]
MITCHELL
Wow. I take it we are cloaked?
CARTER
Pretty cool, huh?
MITCHELL
Yeah.
[Odyssey is hovering right beside Ba'al's ship, but is cloaked from
detection.]
DAVIDSON
(getting up from command chair)
Colonel, the result of your scan is here.
[Carter walks over to where Davidson is standing next to a large
display screen. On it is a schematic of the mothership.]
DAVIDSON
(pointing at display)
This room shows a pronounced level of the same E.M. radiation
generated by the anti-Prior device. Looks like you were right.
MITCHELL
Let's go get her.
INT--CORRIDOR IN BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[SG-1 beams into a corridor and moves out. They make their way to a
guarded door but remain hidden. Carter checks the readings on her
hand-held scanner.]
CARTER
That's it.
[Mitchell uses a a mirror to see around the pillar they are concealed
behind. He signals with two fingers to the others. Daniel glances at
Vala to make sure she is ready; she nods.]
INT--HOLDING AREA ON BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[Ba'al is talking to Adria, who is still in the cage.]
BA'AL
Don't worry, this will all be over soon.
[There is the sound of weapons fire being exchanged outside. Ba'al
turns around toward the door.]
BA'AL
(to his guards)
Jaffa!
[The door opens and Mitchell comes in firing. He shoots the two Jaffa
then shoots Ba'al many times. Ba'al falls to the floor, bloodied on his
back as well as his front. The rest of SG-1 has entered. Vala shoots
Adria with a zat. Daniel lowers his P-90, picks up a staff weapon from
one of the Jaffa, and fires it at the lock to Adria's cage. Vala runs
to open the cage door.]
INT--CORRIDOR IN BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[Carter guards the corridor. Two Jaffa come running down the hallway.
She exchanges fire with them, taking them both out.]
INT--HOLDING AREA ON BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP
[Vala puts a tracking device on Adria's arm and signals to Mitchell
that she's finished.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Odyssey, we are good to go!
[SG-1 and Adria are beamed off the ship.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey jumps to hyperspace, leaving the mothership behind.]
INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM
[Adria is strapped to the same chair Daniel had been when he was a
Prior. Mitchell enters.]
MITCHELL
(tapping on the chair)
Hey. Wake up.
[Adria awakens and then tests the constraints and realizes she can't
move.]
MITCHELL
Sorry.
[Daniel and Carter are at the entrance to the room.]
DANIEL
It's not very comfortable, believe me, I know from experience, but
we're not taking any chances.
VALA
It's over, Adria.
ADRIA/BA'AL
(smiling, in a Goa'uld voice)
I'm afraid you're mistaken. Adria is no longer available.
[Her eyes glow and she smiles, Ba'al-like. Daniel and Vala exchange
looks.]
EXT--SPACE
[Odyssey moves through hyperspace.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 talks to Landry via a two-way viewscreen.]
LANDRY
Ba'al is in Adria?
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. It's the bad guy equivalent of Cordon Bleu.
CARTER
It actually makes sense from his perspective, sir. Not only has he
taken on a more powerful host, but Adria is also in control of the
Ori Army.
LANDRY
So he convinces them to do his bidding and not hers.
DANIEL
Well, when you think about it, their goals aren't all that
different.
CARTER
Control of the galaxy; worship by millions.
MITCHELL
And if the Ori are dead, he'll never be called to the carpet by the
boys upstairs.
LANDRY
What do we do now?
TEAL'C
Kill them both.
[They all glance at Teal'c in surprise.]
MITCHELL
Hard to argue with that logic. It's a two-fer.
CARTER
There's no guarantee that her army would stop fighting even if she
was dead. The only way to be certain is for her to order them to
stand down.
MITCHELL
Then how do we get her to do that?
CARTER
Well, if Ba'al's symbiote is suppressing Adria's consciousness, we
should be able to do the same thing.
DANIEL
Swap Ba'al out for someone we can trust.
TEAL'C
The Tok'ra.
VALA
Doesn't suppressing the host go against their fundamental beliefs?
DANIEL
Well, I'm sure they'd make an exception in this case.
CARTER
We've been trading intelligence with the Tok'ra since the Ori ships
first arrived. They wanna get rid of them just as much as we do.
LANDRY
Get in touch. See if you can set it up. In the meantime, keep a
close eye on your guest.
[The screen winks out.]
INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM
[Mitchell and Teal'c enter.]
ADRIA/BA'AL
So, have you decided what you intend to do with me?
MITCHELL
Well, we're still weighing our options. Teal'c here had a good idea.
ADRIA/BA'AL
(smiling)
I can imagine.
TEAL'C
No...you cannot.
[Adria/Ba'al's smile falters slightly.]
ADRIA/BA'AL
I must caution you against doing anything too rash. In fact, your
best course of action would be to release me.
[As they speak to her, her image is also displayed on a large
viewscreen behind Mitchell.]
MITCHELL
I think we have a difference of opinion, there.
ADRIA/BA'AL
My whole plan was to order the Ori Army back out of this galaxy. You
let me carry it out, we'll be rid of them forever.
TEAL'C
That is our plan as well...only without your participation.
ADRIA/BA'AL
What do you mean?
MITCHELL
He means, we're gonna bring in someone a little more reliable. See,
right now you're like a Pinto engine in a '71 Mustang. We gonna swap
you out for a big block Tok'ra.
ADRIA/BA'AL
(insistent)
It takes a great deal of effort to suppress a consciousness this
powerful. The Tok'ra don't have the strength. Not to mention the
fact that I'll kill Adria the moment you try to remove me.
[She laughs.]
MITCHELL
Well, that's great. We can live with that.
ADRIA/BA'AL
(smugly)
Perhaps. But remember, I'm sharing Adria's mind. You would lose all
access to the knowledge I possess.
MITCHELL
For example?
ADRIA/BA'AL
For one thing, I can confirm the Ori are dead... And that's just the
beginning. With my knowledge and your...pluckiness, we can
accomplish a great deal. Remember how we worked together to locate
the Sangreal?
TEAL'C
As I recall, your efforts were not particularly helpful.
ADRIA/BA'AL
Of course, it's your decision. But it seems you only have two
options. Work with me to our mutual benefit, or kill us both and
miss out on everything I have to offer.
[Teal'c and Mitchell exchange considering looks.]
INT--ODYSSEY RING ROOM
[Daniel and Vala arrive to join Carter and Davidson.]
CARTER
You're just in time. The Tok'ra contingent's about to arrive.
[They arrange themselves in a line facing the ring platform. After a
moment three male Tok'ra ring in. One holds a large box, and there is
another crate on the floor.]
TA'SEEM
(speaking in Tok'ra voice)
I am Ta'seem. I will be performing the surgery. These are my
assistants.
DAVIDSON
Welcome on board the Odyssey. I'm Colonel Davidson. I'm sure you
know Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson and Vala.
TA'SEEM
(stepping toward Vala)
Yes. I knew you as Qetesh.
VALA
Things have changed a little since then.
TA'SEEM
News that the leader of the Ori Army had been captured came as a ray
of hope to my people. That being said, the extraction procedure that
we are about to undertake is extremely difficult. Even though we
have refined the process considerably, there remains a very real
risk that Adria will not survive.
DANIEL
Well, the only other option we have is to leave Ba'al in and trust
he's telling the truth, so...
TA'SEEM
Then we should begin immediately. Zanuf, the symbiote that we
brought, cannot survive outside of a host for long.
DAVIDSON
The infirmary's this way.
[He ushers them out, Ta'seem giving a glance to Vala.]
INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM
[Mitchell, Daniel and Teal'c enter.]
MITCHELL
Time to go.
ADRIA/BA'AL
What about our arrangement?
DANIEL
Oh, you mean the part where you string us along until you overcome
the effects of the anti-Prior device? We'll pass.
[Daniel pulls a zat from behind his back and zats her unconscious.]
INT--ODYSSEY OPERATING ROOM
[Adria is lying on her side on an operating table. Her hair is tucked
into a sterile cap, and she is intubated. Carter and the Tok'ra wear
surgical scrubs and plastic visors. Carter studies a computer display
showing Adria's vital signs and an image of her brain and upper spine.]
CARTER
Sedative appears to be working. Heart-rate and B.P. are holding
steady.
[Ta'seem holds a device up to the back of Adria's neck and activates
it. On the viewscreen, an image of the symbiote around her spine
appears.]
TA'SEEM
There it is. Let's begin. We will need to work quickly. The
symbiote's autonomic response can trigger complications, even under
anesthetic.
INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM
[The rest of SG-1 watch the operation on a monitor.]
TA'SEEM
Initiating the first incision.
[Vala gets up and leaves the room.]
TA'SEEM
I need suction.
[Daniel gets up and follows Vala.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR
[Vala stretches and rubs her neck as if she is stiff. Daniel joins
her.]
DANIEL
What's up?
VALA
(casually)
Nothing. Just didn't feel like sticking around for the surgery. You
know, weak stomach and all that.
[She turns her head away.]
DANIEL
Hey!
[He touches her chin and turns her face back to him.]
DANIEL
You sure you're okay with this?
[She punches him lightly in the shoulder.]
VALA
Why does everyone keep asking me that?
DANIEL
Because she's your daughter. And no matter what she's done, it must
be difficult to see her treated this way.
VALA
Let's get something clear. She's not my daughter, Daniel. The Ori
impregnated me against my will and forced me to bring her into the
galaxy. I was an incubator. A shipping crate. And-and nothing more.
[He steps closer to her.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that you don't feel
something.
VALA
I do. Satisfaction at seeing their plan fail.
INT--ODYSSEY OPERATING ROOM
[Ta'seem is operating.]
TA'SEEM
(to Carter)
There. I've severed the primary nerve conduit. You see how the
filaments are retracting? Now, moving onto the lateral.
[The life-signs monitors start beeping. Ta'seem looks at the readouts.]
CARTER
What is it?
TA'SEEM
I was afraid this might happen.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR
[Mitchell and Teal'c head past Daniel and Vala with a purpose.]
DANIEL
Hey! What's up?
MITCHELL
Trouble with the surgery.
[Daniel follows Mitchell, then Vala does as well.]
INT--ODYSSEY OPERATING ROOM
[The surgery is over, the table now empty except for used supplies.
Ta'seem and Carter remove their surgical robes. The rest of SG-1
enters.]
DANIEL
What happened?
CARTER
Ba'al decided to be even more difficult than usual. We were able to
extract him, but not before he released a deadly toxin into Adria's
nervous system.
VALA
Can't the Tok'ra symbiote heal her?
TA'SEEM
Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the implantation. The host
body was simply too weak. Adria is unconscious at the moment, but
when she awakens, she will suffer greatly before she dies. The one
thing we can do for her is an increased dosage of the toxin. It will
kill her instantly. In the interest of patient care and for our own
safety, I recommend that we administer it immediately.
[Everyone looks at Vala, who nods her assent.]
MITCHELL
Do it.
[Carter looks at Vala in sympathy. Standing next to Vala, Daniel looks
down and sighs.]
VALA
(to Daniel)
I'd like to be there.
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Adria is lying unconscious on a bed, dressed in blue scrubs. An array
of medical displays is behind her. She is tied to the bed at her arms
and ankles, and two armed guards stand nearby. Ta'seem, Vala, and
Daniel enter. Vala tenderly moves a lock of Adria's hair. Daniel stands
at the foot of the bed.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM
[Mitchell, Carter, and Teal'c watch on the monitor.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Ta'seem prepares a syringe of the toxin and gets silent assent from
Vala to use it. Vala walks over to a chair across the room and sits in
it. Ta'seem starts to inject the toxin into the Adria's IV line. Before
he can, Adria comes awake, sees what is going on, and mentally throws
Ta'seem across the room into a wall. He falls, unmoving.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM
MITCHELL
(getting up)
Crap!
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Adria throws the two guards against the wall. She sits up, breaking
her arm restraints, and sends Daniel through the air into the corridor.
He stands and tries to get back into the room, but the doors close. He
tries to open them using the control panel, but nothing happens.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Mitchell, Carter and Teal'c make their way toward the infirmary, but
are stopped two sections away by locked doors that don't respond to the
control panel. They try pushing on the door manually, to no avail. They
stop in frustration.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
VALA
Adria!
ADRIA
You and your friends were trying to kill me, Mother. I can't let
that happen.
[She undoes the restraints on her feet.]
INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE
DAVIDSON
(into comm system)
SG-1, come in! What the hell's going on down there? I'm getting
reports that all sections around the infirmary are being sealed off.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
CARTER
(into comm system)
It's Adria, sir. She's barricaded herself in. Is there any way you
can beam us directly there?
INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE
DAVIDSON
(into comm system)
Negative! She seems to be generating some kind of E.M. interference.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
MITCHELL
(into comm system)
We're gonna need a cutting torch down here ASAP.
DAVIDSON
(via comm system)
You got it.
CARTER
There's an auxiliary control console on this level. If I can get to
it, I might be able to override it.
MITCHELL
Go!
[Carter leaves.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Adria is sitting up but is weak and pale; she collapses back onto the
bed.]
VALA
You can quit acting; you're obviously not sick.
ADRIA
No, this body really is dying. I just want to use what little time I
have left as wisely as possible.
VALA
By doing what? Destroying me and my friends?
ADRIA
Don't be silly, Mother. If I wanted to kill you, I could have done
it a long time ago. No. I need time to prepare.
VALA
Prepare for what?
ADRIA
Ascension.
[Daniel pounds on the door from outside.]
DANIEL
(yelling but muffled)
Vala!
[Vala turns toward the door.]
ADRIA
Don't!
DANIEL
(from outside)
Vala, can you hear me?
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[Daniel activates the comm panel.]
DANIEL
Guys, it's Daniel. I can't reach Vala.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Mitchell is using a blowtorch to cut a hole in the door; he's wearing
welding goggles. Teal'c helps him, wearing dark glasses.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson, what is your location?
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
DANIEL
Just outside the infirmary. Adria's locked them in.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
TEAL'C
We are blocked as well. Colonel Mitchell is attempting to cut
through one of the doors.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
DANIEL
Well, you'd better hurry up. I think I figured out what she's trying
to do. Adria's trying to ascend!
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Mitchell stops and removes his goggles; he and Teal'c are shocked.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
VALA
(approaching her)
Adria...you don't have to do this.
ADRIA
(weakly)
Granted, this wasn't part of my plan, but I can still accomplish a
great deal. Perhaps even more.
VALA
More what? More deaths? More enslavement?
ADRIA
Don't attempt to play on my compassion, Mother. As you said, I'm not
your daughter, I'm an Ori.
VALA
Part Ori, part human.
ADRIA
That will soon change.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Mitchell finishes blow-torching a path in the door. They push the
material through and enter. Now they are one section closer to the
infirmary. Mitchell tries to input the code into the door mechanism,
but nothing happens.]
MITCHELL
Great.
(into radio)
Carter, how's that override coming?
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Carter sits at the auxiliary console.]
CARTER
Well, it's not. I mean, it wouldn't do any good.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
MITCHELL
(into radio)
What the hell does that mean?
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
She's not actually in control of the system. I think she's just
holding the doors shut with her mind.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
MITCHELL
(to Teal'c)
Cutting torch would take too long.
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Adria looks around as if sensing something.]
VALA
What is it?
ADRIA
Your friends are very determined.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Teal'c and Mitchell are using crowbars to try to pry the doors open.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Adria closes her eyes and grimaces in concentration.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[A white substance starts spraying all around Daniel.]
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Uh, Daniel, I'm showing a coolant leak in the hallway you're in
right now.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
DANIEL
Spotted that, thanks! It's Adria! She's trying to distract us!
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Well it's a hell of a distraction. That stuff's toxic! You need to
get out of there, right now.
DANIEL
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem!
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
MITCHELL
Can you shut it down?
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
I'll have to re-route coolant out of the entire section. I'm on it.
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[The coolant is still spraying, and Daniel cannot avoid it.]
DANIEL
(yelling at door)
Vala, if you can hear me, I really need you to open the door!
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Vala hears him and goes to the door but can't do anything. Adria
continues to concentrate.]
VALA
Adria, stop it. Please!
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[Covering his mouth with his jacket, Daniel moves away from the door to
the other side of the chamber and slides to the floor.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Mitchell and Teal'c pry the door open a couple of inches.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Vala picks up a gun, but Adria throws it out of her hands. Vala begins
to choke, then Adria lifts her off the ground. Vala holds her hands to
her throat, straining to breathe.]
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
That's it!
[She gets up and runs out.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[The coolant spray stops. Daniel stays on the floor, hunched over.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
ADRIA
I always wondered if you had it in you to kill me.
[Vala still hangs suspended. Adria slumps back onto the bed.]
ADRIA
Goodbye, Mother.
[Vala falls to the floor, freed.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY
[Carter meets up with Mitchell and Teal'c, who have just gotten the
door open.]
CARTER
Nice work.
MITCHELL
It wasn't us. Adria let go.
[They go through the doors and keep going.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[Vala stands and watches as Adria becomes a bright light, ascending.
After a moment, the light fades.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[Daniel is on the floor, coughing. The others arrive. Mitchell drops
his crowbar and goes to Daniel.]
MITCHELL
Jackson!
DANIEL
I'm okay.
[He helps Daniel up. They walk into the infirmary.]
INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY
[The bed is empty.]
MITCHELL
Where's Adria?
VALA
She's gone.
[They look at each other and the empty room, Daniel with a defeated
expression.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 briefs Landry.]
DANIEL
And once Adria realized she couldn't save herself, she had no choice
but to ascend.
LANDRY
What do you suppose this means for us?
DANIEL
To be honest, I'm not sure. If the Ori are still out there, then
presumably she's joined the fight. But if Ba'al is telling the truth
and the Ori are dead, then she just assumed all the power they once
had.
CARTER
Either way, we could see some incarnation of her again down the
road.
MITCHELL
Holding a serious grudge.
TEAL'C
At least we may take comfort in the knowledge that Ba'al is dead.
MITCHELL
Wouldn't put a deposit down on that just yet. When we were breaking
Adria out of Ba'al's ship, I ran across another clone guarding her.
Killed him, but where there is one...
TEAL'C
There may be more.
LANDRY
We captured and killed Adria and Ba'al on the same day. Are you
telling me this is all a wash?
VALA
No. We dealt the Ori movement a serious blow today. And we rid
ourselves of Adria for the time being. That is definitely a step
ahead.
[Vala smiles mildly, followed by Teal'c and Landry, but Daniel remains
contemplative.]
