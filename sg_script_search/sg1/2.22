TEASER
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[A cryogenic tank is slowly being lifted out of an icy pit.]
TROFSKY
Begin cryo reversal.
RAULLY
Beginning reversal.
[She manipulates the controls on her console, reviving the person
contained in the cryogenic tank.]
COMPUTER
Chamber opening.
[The lid on the cryogenic tank slides open to reveal Colonel Jack
O'Neill. He opens his eyes and takes a deep breath. Raully quickly
moves over to the tank and looks down at him.]
RAULLY
It's okay, Colonel O'Neill. You're in the SGC, you're going to be
fine. No don't try to speak, Colonel. Give it some time.
TROFSKY
Welcome back to the land of the living, Colonel. I'm Major General
Trofsky, this is Doctor Raully.
RAULLY
Maybe we can try to answer some of the questions that are probably
weighing heavily on your mind.
TROFSKY
First of all, I regret to inform you that everyone on your team...Dr
Daniel Jackson, Captain Samantha Carter, and a Jaffa named Teal'c,
are all deceased.
RAULLY
As a matter of fact, I imagine everyone you ever knew is probably
gone now.
TROFSKY
You see, Colonel, the year is now...2077.
END OF TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Raully and Trofsky are at the computer console talking, while O'Neill
lies on a bed before them. A tube is attached to a device on his chest,
feeding him a green substance. Raully sees that he is awake and walks
over to him.]
RAULLY
How are you feeling Colonel?
O'NEILL
(weakly)
A bit confused.
TROFSKY
Understandable. You've been in cryogenic hibernation for almost 79
years.
O'NEILL
How?
RAULLY
That's a good question, we were hoping you could tell us.
TROFSKY
You were sent back through the Stargate already frozen, we're
guessing by some advanced culture. Your CO at the time, General
Hammond, and a Dr Frasier, felt that to thaw you without the proper
technology would probably kill you. They put you in a deep freeze
until such time as the technology was developed that could safely
revive you.
RAULLY
Colonel, do you have any idea what happened to you on that planet?
O'NEILL
No, Ma'am. General...I'd prefer not to answer any more questions.
Walk around a little, get my bearings.
TROFSKY
Of course. Good idea actually. I'd be happy to show you the rest of
the facility.
(to Raully)
You can disconnect him from these machines for a limited time, can't
you Doctor?
RAULLY
For an hour or so. But he needs thermatic infusion for his tissues
to recover properly.
TROFSKY
I'll have him back in less than an hour.
[Raully starts to unhook the tube.]
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[Trofsky is escorting O'Neill through the base. They pass a handful of
SGC personnel.]
VOICE
(over speakers)
SG-14, debriefing in five minutes, level six.
[Trofsky sees O'Neill looking around.]
TROFSKY
Changed much?
O'NEILL
There's no place like home, Sir. How many SG teams are there now,
Sir?
TROFSKY
28 here on Earth, another ten occupying off-world colonies.
O'NEILL
So we finally did that, huh? Populated other planets...?
TROFSKY
Affirmative.
O'NEILL
General, what happened to my team?
TROFSKY
They didn't make it.
O'NEILL
I got that. They didn't make it back through the Gate? They didn't
survive the thawing process, what?
TROFSKY
Their bodies were sent back, but they were already dead. I'm sorry,
Colonel, it was a long time ago.
O'NEILL
Maybe for you.
INT--SGC GATEROOM
[O'Neill, accompanied by Trofsky, enters the gate room and wanders up
the ramp.]
TROFSKY
So, Colonel, do you have any recollection of what happened on your
last mission?
O'NEILL
I wish I did, Sir. I remember intel suggested the planet we were
going to was ruled by a Goa'uld...but I don't remember anything
after we stepped through that gate.
TROFSKY
Can you think of any reason why the Goa'uld might have saved your
life and sent you back?
O'NEILL
It's certainly not their MO.
TROFSKY
We feel whoever did help you, was able to beat back the Goa'uld in
order to do so. We'd love to know who could do that.
O'NEILL
So would I, Sir.
TROFSKY
We have a new technology, that might help you remember. We'd like to
give it a try, if you feel up to it.
VOICE
(over speakers)
SG-22, prepare for embarkation.
[An SG unit enters the Gate room, prepared for a mission.]
O'NEILL
(answering Trofsky)
Sure.
TROFSKY
We'd like to get started right away. Our outpost planets are at war
with the Goa'uld, and...frankly, we're losing. I'm hoping whoever
helped you 79 years ago can help us now.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Raully is handed a pad containing a selection of coin-shaped devices.]
RAULLY
The technology was a gift from the Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
We're still friends with them, huh?
TROFSKY
Oh yes, it's been quite a beneficial alliance.
O'NEILL
Just not much help in the outpost colonies, I take it?
TROFSKY
No.
[Raully presses one of the devices onto O'Neill's temple. It buzzes as
it's implanted.]
O'NEILL
(in obvious pain)
Ow! God, what is that?
RAULLY
It's ok, Colonel, it's in. That's all the pain you'll feel.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
What a shame.
[Raully adjusts the device on O'Neill's temple, then attaches a wire to
it.]
RAULLY
As the Tok'ra explain it, this device stimulates the memory centers
of your mind and then amplifies it. Sort of like a capacitor for
thoughts. And when it's hooked up to this device here, projects what
the mind's eye is seeing holographically.
[She moves over to her computer console.]
O'NEILL
Beautiful.
RAULLY
Now all you have to do is focus your thoughts and...guide the right
memories to the surface.
O'NEILL
How do I do that?
RAULLY
We'll lead you through it. It's kind of like a high tech version of
hypnosis. We've introduced a very light sedative through those tubes
and you should be feeling the effects by now.
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah.
RAULLY
Great, let's get going. Start by concentrating on what race or
culture you can think of from your travels, that might have the
technology to defeat the Goa'uld and cryogenically suspend you.
O'NEILL
The Nox did.
RAULLY
Okay, the Nox. Were they...medically advanced?
[A holographic projector appears next to Trofsky.]
O'NEILL
They could revive their dead.
[His memories of the Nox home-world appear on the projector.]
EXT--NOX HOMEWORLD (DAY)
[Three of the Nox are holding their hands over the prone form of the
Nox woman, Lya. As SG-1 watch, the Nox fade in and out of vision in
their attempt to resurrect her.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
TROFSKY
(watching the hologram)
They could make themselves invisible?
O'NEILL
Not just themselves.
EXT--NOX HOMEWORLD (DAY)
[The Nox leader is standing with his son in the Stargate clearing.
NOX
Before you go O'Neill, there is something we would have you see.
[He waves his arm and SG-1 turns to see a city in the clouds suddenly
appear.]
NOX
Fear not.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
RAULLY
Colonel O'Neill, was it the Nox who sent you here?
O'NEILL
I don't remember.
RAULLY
But they have the technology to make themselves invisible. Could be
a very powerful weapon against the Goa'uld, could it not?
O'NEILL
Probably. But they'd never use it in that manner. The Nox wouldn't
even fight in self-defense.
TROFSKY
Can you think of anyone else who could have defeated the Goa'uld?
O'NEILL
The Asgard.
[An image of SG-1 on the planet Cimmeria appears on the projector.]
EXT--CIMMERIA (DAY)
[Dark clouds are gathering over the pyramids Heru'ur had constructed
after his invasion of the planet.]
O'NEILL
Oh my.
[The hull of a space ship begins to appear through the clouds.]
DANIEL
Ladies and gentlemen, I think this is Thor's Chariot.
TEAL'C
(in awe)
An Asgard Mother ship. I have heard them described in Jaffa legend.
[SG-1 turns as they hear a high pitched noise. Their Jaffa guards are
suddenly beamed away. The beam passes over HEru'ur's pyramids, making
them vanish.]
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Raully and Trofsky share a glance. Their attention is captured as
another image appears on the holographic projector.]
INT--ASGARD WORLD, GATEROOM
[O'Neill is thrown out of the Stargate and rolls painfully down the
steps. He looks up to see two Asgard watching him. Behind them, he can
see more Asgard, standing in a long corridor.]
O'NEILL
(to the two aliens)
You're the Asgard, Thor's race, right?
ASGARD #1
You have heard of us?
O'NEILL
Nothing but good things.
ASGARD #1
We have studied your race closely.
O'NEILL
What did you learn?
ASGARD #2
That your species has great potential.
O'NEILL
Great potential. That's good.
ASGARD #1
Understand this. There was once an alliance of four great races in
the galaxy...the Asgard, the Nox...
O'NEILL
Met them.
ASGARD #1
The Furlings...
O'NEILL
Don't know them.
ASGARD #1
And the Ancients, the builders of the Stargates.
O'NEILL
That's a pretty heady group.
ASGARD #1
Your race has much to prove before we may interact on that level.
[O'Neill gets to his feet.]
O'NEILL
Look, you all seem to be quite wonderful...
[He takes a moment to study the second Asgard before him.]
O'NEILL
...people.
[He kneels before the second Asgard.]
O'NEILL
But you folks should understand that we're out there now. We might
not be ready for a lot of this stuff, but we're doing the best we
can.
[The second Asgard reaches out a hand, and, after a moment, O'Neill
takes it.]
ASGARD #2
You have already taken the first steps towards becoming...the Fifth
Race.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
O'NEILL
They're part of a...an alliance.
INT--ERNEST'S PLANET, HELIOPOLIS
[SG-1, along with Catherine, watch as Ernest removes a cloth covering a
pedestal set in the center of the room. Around them, the walls are
covered in various alien writings.]
O'NEILL
What is this place?
[Ernest offers Daniel his diary.]
DANIEL
(reading from the diary)
I believe this room is some sort of meeting place, where four alien
races, denoted by the symbols and distinctive writing on the walls,
would gather. Possibly to share knowledge or discuss relations like
a United Nations of the stars. Catherine agrees.
CATHERINE
(to Ernest)
You're right, I would have.
[O'Neill looks more closely at the pedestal.]
O'NEILL
This looks familiar.
ERNEST
Touch it.
[O'Neill hesitantly places his hand on the center stone. A bolt of
energy suddenly shoots upwards.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
[Above them, there appear hundreds of glowing holographic images.]
CATHERINE
It's beautiful!
O'NEILL
Daniel, does this mean anything?
DANIEL
Well, if this was a Mecca of sorts, an alien United Nations this has
to mean something.
O'NEILL
(pointing to one floating symbol)
I know this.
CATHERINE
Of course, high school chemistry.
DANIEL
One proton, one electron...hydrogen.
CATHERINE
Beryllium, sodium...
ERNEST
Silver, iron, barium, neon...
[O'Neill waves his gun through one of the holograms. Daniel suddenly
realizes the purpose of the holograms.]
DANIEL
(excitedly)
Of course! How do you ensure universal communication? You reduce the
method of communication to the most basic elements common to
everyone and everything that exists in the universe. Jack, this is a
true...universal...language.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[O'Neill's memory device lets out a high pitched beep and he jumps as
if shocked. The holographic projector flickers, malfunctioning, then
disappears.]
RAULLY
(to Trofsky)
He's had enough for now. Let's let him rest.
TROFSKY
(to O'Neill)
Thank you, Colonel.
(To Raully)
Good work.
[Raully presses a button on the bed and a purple liquid runs through
the tube attached to O'Neill.]
TROFSKY
(to Raully)
We'll resume later.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Trofsky and Raully enter a second cryogenics room as a tank is being
lifted out of the pit. The lid slides back to reveal Daniel.]
TROFSKY
It's okay, Dr Jackson, you're in the SGC. You're going to be fine.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[In a third cryogenics room, another tank is being lifted out of a
pit.]
TROFSKY
This one has naquadah in her system, so keep her a little more
dosed.]
[Raully makes some adjustments on her computer. The lid on the tank
slides back to reveal Carter. She opens her eyes and starts to cough.]
TROFSKY
It's okay, Dr Carter, you're in the SGC. You're going to be fine.
CARTER
(whispering)
SG-1?
RAULLY
I'm afraid they didn't make it, Captain. I'm sorry.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Carter is sitting on a bed, touching the device implanted in her
temple. Raully is at her computer console, adjusting the controls to
Carter's memory device.]
RAULLY
There, how does that feel Captain?
CARTER
Okay. Ah, it hurts a little. Listen, is this really necessary?
RAULLY
Well, it's important that we know who would have the technology to
do this.
CARTER
Why?
RAULLY
Because, Captain Carter, anyone with that technology would be a very
powerfully ally against Apophis.
CARTER
(surprised)
Apophis? Isn't he dead?
RAULLY
(after a moment)
Well, of course he is. We're merely trying to stimulate the region
of your memory that involves doing battle with the Goa'uld. It might
help us in our current battles.
CARTER
Okay, well, we did fight the Goa'uld a lot.
RAULLY
Tell me how you defeated Apophis.
[A holographic projector appears, connected to Carter's memory device.]
CARTER
Well, we gated to what we thought was their home base, but...we
ended up on a Goa'uld Mothership.
INT--PYRAMID SHIP
[SG-1 are quietly exploring the room. There is a sarcophagus in the
center of the room.]
DANIEL
Sarcophagus.
O'NEILL
Oh great, more snakeheads. Teal'c, any idea which one's in here?
[Teal'c, staring intently out of the window, doesn't reply.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[Carter stands alongside Teal'c.]
CARTER
We're not on a planet, are we?
[As they look outside, they can see they are moving through space.]
TEAL'C
That is correct. It appears we are aboard a Goa'uld transport
vessel.
CARTER
And that jolt was...?
TEAL'C
Hyper-launch.
INT--PYRAMID SHIP, CORRIDOR
[A group of Jaffa pass by Carter and Daniel, who are hidden in an
alcove. When the Jaffa are gone, Carter and Daniel slip out behind them
and move quickly down the corridor. They come to a hanger bay full of
death gliders.]
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Raully is watching the images on the projector.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP
[O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Bra'tac are standing above the ship's
glowing generators.
BRA'TAC
The shield-generators are far below. There, in the very bowels of
the ship. We must climb down several decks, through the length of
the ship. Then, taking our weapons we must...
[He pauses as O'Neill pulls the pins on a couple of grenades, then
simply drops them over the edge. They watch as the generators explode.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP, HANGER BAY
[Bra'tac and O'Neill enter their death glider. Alongside them, Carter
and Teal'c are doing the same.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP
[A pack of C4 is counting down, with only a minute to spare.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP, CONTROL ROOM
[Apophis turns away from his screen and stands beside his son Klorel.
Transport rings come down from above and takes them away.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP
[The C4 is still counting down, with only seconds left on the timer.
The death gliders containing O'Neill, Teal'c, Carter and Bra'tac begin
to exit the pyramid ship.]
O'NEILL
Our time is up, we have got to go.
CARTER
(sitting behind Teal'c)
Punch it.
[The death gliders shoot out of the ship, just as the C4 blows. Behind
them, the two pyramid ships erupt in flames.]
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
RAULLY
Very impressive, Captain. The end of Apophis.
CARTER
Well, the beginning of the end, yes. His forces were so weakened
that another Goa'uld eventually got him.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[Daniel, a device implanted in his temple, is sitting on a bed as
Trofsky enters the room.]
TROFSKY
So if it wasn't Apophis, what other Goa'uld could it be?
[A holographic projector appears behind Daniel.]
DANIEL
Well, there seems to be a lot of them. Sokar...
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Sokar's burning image is being projected onto the Stargate's iris.]
SOKAR
People of the Tau'ri. You have taken what is mine. For this you will
be destroyed.
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
DANIEL
Heru'ur
INT--ABYDOS GATEROOM
[O'Neill runs down the Stargate's steps, firing his weapon at Heru'ur.
But the bullets bounce off Heru'ur's energy shield.]
HERU'UR
You dare challenge me?
[He raises a ribbon device, which starts to glow. O'Neill unhooks his
knife.]
O'NEILL
I was thinking about it.
[He throws his knife at Heru'ur. It strikes the Goa'uld's ribbon
device, embedding itself in the center stone. Heru'ur struggles to fire
his malfunctioning weapon.]
HERU'UR
You'll pay for this insolence!
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
DANIEL
And then of there was Hathor. She almost succeeded in doing some
pretty big damage.
INT--SGC, VIP ROOM
[O'Neill is standing before Hathor.]
HATHOR
We must praise you and gift you a great honor.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I'm sure that would be just great, but not right....
[He is cut off as Hathor breathes out a pink vapor, drugging him. He
doesn't resist as she begins to unbutton his shirt. Hathor pulls away
her own clothing to reveal a glowing device strapped to her abdomen.
She presses herself against O'Neill.]
HATHOR
Do not worry yourself. You will enjoy the rich rewards that come
with what we are giving you. You will cherish the good health and
long life that goes with being...
[In agony, O'Neill breaks way from her and slumps against the wall.]
HATHOR
...Hathor's first, new Jaffa.
[O'Neill looks down at his stomach and sees he has been given a Goa'uld
incubation pouch.]
INT--SGC
[Hathor is sitting fully clothed in a hot, steaming bath. Daniel is
kneeling at her side. They are surrounded by armed SGC soldiers who are
under Hathor's control.]
HATHOR
We demand that the woman you call Carter be brought before us so
that we may gain retribution.
DANIEL
Captain Carter does deserve to be punished, my Queen, but she does
not know what she is doing. I beg of you to show mercy.
[As they talk, O'Neill and Carter covertly enter the room, armed with
tranquilizer guns.]
HATHOR
She deserves no mercy from us. She will make amends with her death.
[Carter and O'Neill shoot the SGC soldiers with tranquilizer darts.]
CARTER
(to Hathor)
I don't think so.
[Hathor lifts a concealed ribbon device and fires it at Carter, who is
thrown against the wall.]
HATHOR
(to O'Neill)
You have failed us, our love. You will not fail us again.
[Her eyes glow and she raises the ribbon device once more. Carter,
recovered, shoots at Hathor with her side-arm. The bath, containing
Hathor's Goa'uld larvae, catches fire and burning baby Goa'uld fall out
onto the floor.]
DANIEL
No!
[Carter and O'Neill quickly move in and help the tranquilized soldiers
out of the room.]
O'NEILL
Get these airmen out of here. Daniel, let's go, move it!
[Daniel doesn't move as he looks on in utter shock. Meanwhile, Hathor
climbs out of the burning waters and vanishes out of the room.]
INT--CRYOGENICS ROOM
[The image on the holographic projector abruptly vanishes.]
TROFSKY
(to Daniel)
What's wrong?
DANIEL
Nothing, I just...I really need to know what exactly happened to my
friends.
TROFSKY
As I said, they were sent back through the Gate. They were already
dead. That's all I know.
DANIEL
What about General Hammond?
TROFSKY
Well, I'm happy to report he lived to a ripe old age of 93.
DANIEL
So everyone I ever knew is basically gone.
TROFSKY
I'm afraid so.
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[Teal'c, lying in a bed, opens his eyes to see Dr Fraiser standing over
him.]
FRAISER
It's okay, it's okay. You're in the SGC Teal'c.
[General Hammond is waiting at her side.]
HAMMOND
Good to have you back, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
General Hammond.
[He suddenly sits upright.]
FRAISER
Easy, easy.
TEAL'C
Where are the rest of SG-1?
HAMMOND
Good question. We were hoping you could tell us.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Dressed in his SGC uniform, Teal'c begins to put on his jacket.]
HAMMOND
When you didn't return, we sent SG teams three and seven after you.
They found you lying next to the Stargate. There was no trace of
Colonel O'Neill, Captain Carter or Dr Jackson. We assume they were
captured.
FRAISER
You have no memory of this, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
I do. It was mixture of Horus and Serpent Guards, a very unusual
combination.
Hammond and Fraiser exchange a worried glance.
HAMMOND
Serving what Goa'uld?
TEAL'C
That I do not know. General Hammond, I will return to the planet
immediately to search for the answers.
[He starts to head for the corridor.]
HAMMOND
I can't let you do that Teal'c.
[Teal'c pauses for a moment, then turns back to the General.]
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I will not remain idle while my friends may be in
danger on this planet.
FRAISER
Teal'c, you've been unconscious for three weeks.
TEAL'C
That is not possible. My symbiote would have awakened me long before
the period of three weeks.
FRAISER
You were barely alive Teal'c, with substantial internal injury.
HAMMOND
Dr Fraiser spent most of the three weeks at your side. I'm convinced
it was her refusal to give up that kept you alive.
[Teal'c inclines his head to Fraiser.]
TEAL'C
I am in your debt Dr Fraiser. General Hammond, permit me to return
to this planet to search out my friends. If their bodies were not
found by my side then they are prisoners.
HAMMOND
If they're prisoners, they're long gone from that planet. We sent
out UAVs, balloons, our best rescue teams...found nothing but
scorched earth. There was no trace of them. They could be moved to
any Goa'uld strong hold. You'd be searching for a needle in a very
large haystack.
TEAL'C
Perhaps. But I must try.
[Teal'c turns away once more, but Hammond moves to stand before him,
preventing him from leaving.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, I understand your desire to do something, anything, for
SG-1. I feel the same way. But I cannot expend any more resources on
this. I'm sorry, request denied.
TEAL'C
If the people of the Tau'ri have given up hope on SG-1, then it is
with great regret that I must leave this world and return to my
people.
HAMMOND
You mean you want to leave the SGC?
TEAL'C
That is correct.
HAMMOND
I can't let you do that Teal'c. I won't let you do it.
TEAL'C
General Hammond. I hereby respectfully inform you...that I must take
my leave of the SGC.
[He slowly removes his jacket.]
TEAL'C
Therefore I am no longer under your command.
[He lets the jacket drop to the floor.]
HAMMOND
I can't allow you to do that. You represent too great a security
risk.
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I would die before divulging any information
concerning this world. I believe you know that.
HAMMOND
(relenting)
Yes I do.
TEAL'C
I will depart in an hour.
[This time, Hammond allows Teal'c to pass.]
INT--CYROGENICS ROOM
[O'Neill, seemingly asleep, has his hand clenched around the tube
feeding him the drugs. He opens his eyes and hears Trofsky and Raully
arguing in Goa'uld.]
TROFSKY
Kelmac kree, mak'tel'a!
RAULLY
Roc'kree'no. Ma'tal!
[They both abruptly leave. An orderly is checking the readings on the
computer and making adjustments. O'Neill surreptitiously pulls out the
tubes, then coughs, capturing the orderly's attention. As the man bends
over him, O'Neill grabs him and knocks him out. O'Neill begins to
exchange clothes with the unconscious man.]
INT--SGC GATEROOM
[The Stargate is spinning as Teal'c's home-world is dialed.]
VOICE
(over speakers)
Chevron four engaged.
[Teal'c, dressed in a long, pale robe, enters the Gateroom, carrying
only his staff weapon. Hammond, along with a handful of SGC personnel,
are waiting for him.]
SOLDIER
Ten-hut!
[The soldiers come to attention.]
VOICE
(over speakers)
Chevron five engaged.
[Teal'c comes to stand before Hammond.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, you will be missed.
TEAL'C
(with much emotion)
I have learned much from you General Hammond. And I thank you.
[He bows his head.]
VOICE
(over speakers)
Chevron six engaged.
HAMMOND
I've learned a lot from you too, Teal'c. So we're even on that
account.
VOICE
(over speakers)
Chevron seven is locked.
HAMMOND
Take care of yourself.
[Behind Teal'c, the Stargate opens. Teal'c places his hand over his
heart. Hammond and the soldiers respectfully salute him, and, slowly,
Teal'c returns the gesture. He turns away and walks up the ramp. At the
top, he pauses, then enters the Stargate. The wormhole closes behind
him.]
HAMMOND
(to the soldiers)
At ease.
INT--FALSE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, dressed in the orderly's clothes, moves through the silent
corridors. He uses a stolen key-card to operate the elevator and steps
inside. When the doors open on the next level, he sees a Goa'uld
corridor stretching out before him. Behind him, the elevator's doors
close. A pair of Jaffa suddenly appear and O'Neill quickly hides in an
alcove until they pass. He wanders through the corridors, hiding when
two more Jaffa appear. As he nears another elevator, the memory device
implanted in his temple suddenly activates. He stumbles against the
wall as he unwittingly recalls the mission aboard Apophis' pyramid
ship.]
INT--PYRAMID SHIP
[As O'Neill glances round a corner, a pair of Jaffa open fire. He
quickly dives and rolls out, shooting the both with his zat gun.]
INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR
[Recovering from the sudden memory, O'Neill gets up off the floor and
heads into the elevator.]
INT--FALSE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill hurries through the familiar corridors, pausing as he comes to
the cryogenics room where Carter is being held. He sneaks into the room
and picks up a heavy canister. As the orderly bends over the
unconscious Captain, O'Neill hits him over the head with the canister.]
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Carter. Carter!
[He detaches the tubes that are feeding Carter the drugs.]
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Carter!
[Carter sluggishly opens her eyes, then blinks in surprise when she
sees him. O'Neill quickly puts a finger to his lips signaling for
silence.]
CARTER
(whispering)
I thought you were dead.
[Her memory device activates and the holographic projector starts up.]
INT--SGC GATEROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c are in the Gateroom, attempting to send a device
back to the planet SG-1 took it from. The device suddenly activates and
spikes start to shoot out.]
CARTER
(in the Control Room)
Get out of there!
[A spike barely misses Teal'c, but one catches O'Neill through the
shoulder and pins him to the wall. Carter runs into the Gateroom and
rushes over to O'Neill.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[She takes a look at the spike holding him against the wall.]
CARTER
It's right through his shoulder into the concrete...
INT--FALSE SGC, CRYOGENICS ROOM
[O'Neill detaches the wire leading to Carter's memory device and the
holographic projector vanishes.]
CARTER
Whoa.
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Yeah. These things have a nasty habit of going off when you least
expect it. Try not to think too much.
CARTER
(quietly)
They said...
O'NEILL
They're Goa'uld, Carter.
CARTER
Daniel? Teal'c?
O'NEILL
Don't know yet. Think you can walk?
[Carter sits upright.]
CARTER
The drugs must have prevented me from sensing the naquadah.
[O'Neill nods towards the unconscious orderly.]
O'NEILL
Trade clothes with that guy.
INT--FALSE SGC, CORRIDOR
[Carter and O'Neill cautiously make their way through the fake SGC
facility.]
CARTER
Sure looks like the SGC.
[They enter the elevator and exit at the pyramid level.]
CARTER
Wow, this looks just like...
O'NEILL
(quickly)
Don't think about it, you'll set that thing off...
[But he's too late and Carter's memory device activates.]
CARTER
(clutching her temple)
Ow!
[A group of Jaffa, led by Raully approaches. O'Neill grabs Carter,
covering her mouth to prevent her making any noise, and drags her
behind a wall. Raully and the Jaffa enter the elevator without seeing
them.]
CARTER
(whispering)
Can we take these things off?
O'NEILL
(quietly)
I don't know, you tell me. Mine's in pretty deep.
CARTER
Yeah, you're right, pulling them out might cause some pretty nasty
collateral damage.
O'NEILL
No, we don't want that.
[They head down the corridor and enter the third elevator.]
INT--FALSE SGC, CORRIDOR
[They enter another set of corridors, exactly like the SGC.]
O'NEILL
What the hell?
INT--FALSE SGC, CRYOGENICS ROOM
O'NEILL
Daniel. Daniel!
[Daniel opens his eyes to see O'Neill and Carter standing by his bed.]
DANIEL
I don't understand, they said...
CARTER
They're Goa'uld, Daniel.
DANIEL
What year is it?
CARTER
1999, more than likely.
DANIEL
So this is all a hoax?
O'NEILL
Big hoax. I'd say so.
DANIEL
I have more questions, but that can wait.
O'NEILL
Ya, come on.
INT--FALSE SGC, CORRIDOR
[SG-1 move quietly down the corridors, looking for a way out. O'Neill
yanks open a door, but finds only blank wall behind.]
O'NEILL
Damned cost cutting.
CARTER
This facade is obviously part of a bigger Goa'uld facility, complete
with Horus and Serpent Guards.
DANIEL
What? Horus and Serpent? That's kind of an odd alliance, isn't it?
INT--FALSE SGC, GATEROOM
[Carter, O'Neill and Daniel enter the fake Gateroom.]
DANIEL
I've never seen this place so deserted.
CARTER
Guess they figure they don't need to keep up the act if we're
unconscious.
[O'Neill experimentally kicks the Stargate.]
O'NEILL
It's fake.
[Daniel yanks open a locker, but finds it empty.]
DANIEL
I don't understand. Who would have spent enough time in the base to
be able to reproduce it in this kind of detail? You don't think
Apophis...
VOICE
Silence!
[At the top of the Stargate ramp, the air suddenly shimmers and Hathor
appears. She heads down the ramp towards Daniel.]
O'NEILL
(as Hathor passes him)
Oh, I was so hoping never to see you again.
[Raully and Trofsky, armed with zats, appear from each of the gate
room's exits, along with a dozen, armed Jaffa. Hathor makes her way
down to Daniel and strokes his face.]
HATHOR
We have indeed missed you, our beloved.
CARTER
Daniel, don't let her breathe on you.
HATHOR
You think that we would go to these lengths if you were not already
immune to that organism?
[Carter shoots O'Neill a look, but he simply shrugs. Hathor leaves
Daniel and walks lazily around her Jaffa guards. Daniel joins O'Neill
and Carter on the Stargate ramp.]
HATHOR
Do you like our guards? We managed to lure them from the remote
outposts of our enemies. We are quietly building our forces before
the System Lords even know that we are alive. But doing so is
difficult when we have to operate with limited knowledge of the
state of the empire.
[O'Neill holds up his hand.]
O'NEILL
Let me take a guess, it's just a wild guess, but that's where we
come in, right?
CARTER
We know more than you do.
HATHOR
Perhaps. We are prepared to offer you a life of luxury as servants
in our royal court, for sharing information. Deny us...and you will
not enjoy the alternative.
[She comes to stand before O'Neill, waiting for an answer.]
O'NEILL
You know...you really should do something about the breath.
HATHOR
How do we contact the Asgard so that we might align with their
forces?
O'NEILL
Try Roswell, little place in New Mexico.
HATHOR
(moving onto Carter)
What is the sequence of numbers necessary to open the barricade
protecting your Stargate?
[When Carter doesn't answer, Hathor turns away.]
HATHOR
If you will not give us the information that we desire, we do have
another means of retrieving it.
[She snaps her finger and a Jaffa enters the Gateroom, moving to stand
before her.]
HATHOR
An opportunity has presented itself, at a most...fortuitous time.
[She reaches into the Jaffa's pouch and pulls out a writhing, adult
Goa'uld. She holds it out for SG-1 to see.]
HATHOR
Our friend here is ready for a host. Tell us, which one of you shall
it be?
TO BE CONTINUED...
