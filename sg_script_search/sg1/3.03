TEASER
FADE IN
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[General George Hammond is standing before a podium at the top of the
Gate ramp, addressing a roomful of SGC personnel.]
HAMMOND
You have fought with valour and courage, sacrificed for each other,
for this country, for this planet. To honour the men and women of
the SGC, I present Arthur Simms, the Secretary of Defense for the
United States of America.
[Simms takes the stand.]
SIMMS
Since the reinception of this program, I have eagerly awaited every
word of every mission report stemming from this base like a
wide-eyed child waiting for his next bedtime story. Not actually
being here, or seeing your faces, or this Stargate here behind me,
it is sometimes easy to forget that it's all really happening. The
President regrets not being able to be here, but I'm glad because it
gives me the opportunity to congratulate you on your recent effort
in defeating a formidable enemy and rescuing SG-1 captured in the
line of duty. You risk your lives every day in a way more dangerous
and fantastic than any of us could have ever dreamed. Understand
that I represent every person of this great nation when I salute
your ongoing heroic spirit. You should be proud.
[Hammond retakes the stand as Simms step down.]
HAMMOND
Before we finish today, I have one other small bit of business.
Please come to attention.
[The SGC personnel present stand to attention.]
HAMMOND
(reading from a piece of paper)
From the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. In recognition of
Captain Samantha Carter's outstanding work, I hereby authorise her
immediate promotion to the rank of Major. Captain, step forward.
[As a surprised Carter steps forward, the room breaks into applause.
Both General Hammond and O'Neill start to pin onto her uniform the bars
of major.]
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
The United States Air Force has recognised that you have fulfilled
tasks and duties well beyond the responsibility of Captain. It is
with great pleasure that I bestow upon you the responsibilities, the
respect and the rank of Major.
[Hammond shakes Carter's hand, and they salute each other.]
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
O'NEILL
Well done...Major.
[Carter and O'Neill shake hands and salute. Smiling, Carter returns to
her place with the rest of SG1 amid more applause.]
HAMMOND
In closing, Major Carter's supervisor, Colonel Jack O'Neill, would
like to say a few words.
[O'Neill takes the stand, to more applause.]
O'NEILL
Normally, I'm a man of very few words...
[He abruptly disappears in a flash of light. The assembled personnel
look around in surprise and confusion.]
HAMMOND
Code 9!
[Alarms sound as security personnel run to take up position.]
INT--ASGARD SHIP IN ORBIT ABOVE EARTH
O'NEILL
And in conclusion, I'd like to say...
[He stops as he realises he is no longer in the SGC and begins to look
around. There is another flash of light and an Asgard appears in a
chair opposite.]
ASGARD
Greetings, Jack O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Greetings. Have we met?
ASGARD
I am Thor.
END OF TEASER
INT--ASGARD SHIP
THOR
I apologise for taking you by surprise, but I have come on a matter
of great importance.
O'NEILL
We're in orbit around Earth, right?
THOR
Yes.
O'NEILL
You know, we have satellites, telescopes. They can see things like
spaceships.
THOR
Our ships have never been detected in orbit around Earth before.
O'NEILL
Oh. All right. Sorry, you were saying something? A matter of great
importance...?
THOR
We received word of what transpired with your people and the Goa'uld
named Hathor.
O'NEILL
She had it coming.
THOR
As a result, the Goa'uld System Lords have turned their attention
towards you.
O'NEILL
What, for killing Hathor? They should be thanking us. She was
planning to overthrow them you know.
THOR
Her intentions are irrelevant. Earth has once again proven it can be
a formidable threat to the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Oh, now we're a threat to them?
THOR
They have decided it is a concern to be dealt with. The System Lords
are capable of launching an assault one hundred times more powerful
than that which you previously withstood at the hands of Apophis.
O'NEILL
Okay, that could be a problem.
THOR
The Asgard agree. I have come to offer our assistance.
O'NEILL
Now see, that would be appreciated. I've seen your work...it's
great.
THOR
The vast majority of the Asgard fleet is currently unavailable.
O'NEILL
Oh. So what do you have in mind?
THOR
With your permission, the Asgard will attempt to negotiate with the
Goa'uld System Lords to include Earth in the Protected Planets
Treaty.
O'NEILL
That's a good thing, right?
THOR
It would prevent this attack.
O'NEILL
Good. Um, to be honest with you, I'd rather have a fleet of your
ships here. A few of these babies and we could just...
[He stops as Thor gives him a curious look.]
O'NEILL
We could try the negotiating thing.
THOR
I will contact the System Lords. You may return to your planet now.
[Thor disappears in a flash of light, but O'Neill is left behind.]
O'NEILL
Excuse me! I assume someone's going to show me the way back.
[The light surrounds him.]
O'NEILL
Thank you!
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
HAMMOND
Why would the Goa'uld agree to this negotiation?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld fear the Asgard.
DANIEL
Plus I assume the Asgard would offer the Goa'uld something in
return. I mean, that's generally the way negotiations work.
HAMMOND
Well what if the summit fails?
O'NEILL
Thor said that was pretty much the only option he could offer. If it
fails...total annihilation.
HAMMOND
The President is wondering how confident we are in trusting the
Asgard.
CARTER
The Tok'ra trust them.
DANIEL
They helped Jack out when he got the Ancients' language downloaded
into his brain.
O'NEILL
You got to love them for that.
HAMMOND
But we know very little about the politics out there. How do we know
the Asgard truly have our best interests at heart?
O'NEILL
Well, I suppose we don't. But if they have any other agenda in
mind...
[He is cut off as a bright light appears in the room and Thor
materialises.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, do we need security?
O'NEILL
No, I'll vouch for him, sir. Major Samantha Carter, Doctor Daniel
Jackson, you remember Thor? Uh, Thor, this is Teal'c and Major
General George Hammond. He's the leader of our facility here.
THOR
The System Lords have agreed to negotiate.
O'NEILL
That's good news.
THOR
They will arrive in four days.
O'NEILL
(surprised)
Here?
THOR
It is customary for such negotiations to take place on the planet in
question. Three representatives from the System Lords will arrive by
Stargate. You must be prepared to speak on behalf of all the
inhabitants of Earth.
O'NEILL
Uh, well maybe not me personally...
THOR
We have chosen you, O'Neill, to represent your planet at the
proceedings.
O'NEILL
All right, now see, that could be a mistake. You see, Doctor Jackson
here is an extremely educated and articulated man, very well versed
in all the languages...
THOR
You have led your people into the galaxy through the Stargate. You
are our choice, O'Neill. Further instructions to aid you in
preparation will follow.
[Thor disappears.]
O'NEILL
Well, there you go.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is lecturing the people present on the three Goa'ulds they are
expecting. An ancient Greek image of Cronus is highlighted on the
projector screen.]
DANIEL
Cronus was among the earliest Greek gods, one of twelve Titans who
eventually ascended to supreme domination. He was God of Fate and
eventually became father to Zeus, Hera, Poseidon and Hades. Now this
last relationship may indicate a connection to the Goa'uld Sokar.
TEAL'C
Cronus is the most influential of the System Lords. It was he who
originally banished Sokar. Cronus was also a mortal enemy of
Apophis.
DANIEL
Which may indicate why the System Lords didn't join in Apophis'
attack on Earth.
TEAL'C
The System Lords reluctantly banded together to defend Goa'uld
territory against outside threats such as the Asgard and the Reetou.
However, they still battle amongst themselves for control of their
individual domains.
[Daniel selects another image.]
DANIEL
Uh, the second Goa'uld representative we're expecting is Yu.
O'NEILL
Me?
DANIEL
Yu is the name of the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Sorry.
DANIEL
Also known as Yu the Great, he did not assume the role of a god per
se, but may have been one of China's earliest Emperors. Legend says
he possessed great mythic powers and sprang into the world from a
dragon's body. Ancient scrolls say he founded the first recorded
dynasty whose advances came about under harsh rule. However, it
should be noted that Yu did account for a number of notable,
positive influences.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Thank you.
[Daniel gives him an annoyed look.]
O'NEILL
Sorry.
DANIEL
According to Thor's message, Yu is the most likely to favour this
treaty as his interests no longer reside in this area of the galaxy.
HAMMOND
And the third Goa'uld, Doctor Jackson?
[Daniel changes the picture once more.]
DANIEL
Another one we haven't met, but have a certain...familiarity with.
For those in the room who don't know, Nirrti is the Goa'uld who
wiped out all but one survivor of P8X 987, along with four members
of the SGC, in an attempt to destroy Earth's Stargate.
CARTER
Cassandra's planet.
DANIEL
Little is known about Nirrti from Earth's perspective. In early
Hindu reference she was a destructive goddess of darkness.
CARTER
So we're going to let these Goa'uld just...walk in here?
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
There are a number of aspects of this situation I'm not comfortable
with, Major.
(To Daniel)
Thank you Doctor Jackson.
[The lights in the briefing room come back on.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, I would like you to act as liaison to the Goa'uld. Doctor
Jackson...
TEAL'C
(interrupting)
General Hammond.
HAMMOND
Is there a problem?
TEAL'C
I mean no disrespect. But I have given my allegiance to you, to the
SGC and to the people of this world, freely. I will, however, not
see to the petty needs of these Goa'ulds.
DANIEL
(to Hammond)
I'll...see to the petty needs of the Goa'uld, sir.
HAMMOND
Okay, Doctor Jackson. Teal'c, you will assist Major Castleman with
base security. According to Thor, Treaty Laws will not permit
weapons of any kind in this facility during negotiations...
O'NEILL
Whoa! Sir, that doesn't sound wise.
HAMMOND
We're largely trusting the Asgard based on your word, Colonel. This
is their rule. As a result, the base is completely sealed off from
the surface. The Secretary of Defense will be staying to represent
the President. Storage Room 12A on level 17 will be converted to a
meeting room for security reasons. You've all received folders that
include your individual assignments, preparation instruction as laid
out by the Asgard. There's a lot of work to do people and not much
time.
INT--SGC STORAGE ROOM
[A technician unlocks a safe and removes the Goa'uld artefacts. Carter
hands the Goa'uld ribbon device to the waiting soldier, who gestures at
the remaining Goa'uld healing device.]
SOLDIER
What about that one, Major?
[Carter removes the healing device to show him.]
CARTER
This is a Goa'uld healing device. Those two are the weapons.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill catches up with General Hammond.]
O'NEILL
General.
HAMMOND
Colonel, how are your briefings going?
O'NEILL
I had no idea how exciting diplomacy could be, sir. What's this
about?
HAMMOND
I'm not sure, it's Teal'c.
[Teal'c and a sergeant are waiting in the corridor.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, Sergeant, what's the problem?
SERGEANT
He won't relinquish his weapon, sir.
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
Like you, I do not believe we should remove all weapons from this
base.
HAMMOND
The Asgard were explicit. If they detect weapons, there will be no
summit.
O'NEILL
No summit, no treaty.
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld that you are allowing through your Stargate are among
the most deceptive and treacherous that I have ever known.
HAMMOND
Thor's assured us the Goa'ulds are also forbidden from bringing
weapons.
O'NEILL
If this treaty doesn't happen, they're going to send a hundred of
those motherships here. You know as well as I do what that means.
HAMMOND
Teal'c, I'm ordering you to turn your weapon over.
[Teal'c slowly relinquishes his staff weapon to the sergeant.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Security personnel run through the corridors to take up positions as
the SGC I sealed off. The Stargate finishes dialling as O'Neill, Carter
and Daniel join Hammond at the bottom of the gate ramp, ready to greet
the Goa'uld. The Secretary of Defense watches from the Control Room.]
TECHNICIAN
Chevron seven's locked. Offworld activation.
[The Stargate opens and Cronus appears, followed by Nirrti and Yu.]
INT--SGC
[Daniel and Cronus enter one of the VIP rooms.]
DANIEL
Here we are...the VIP room. That's an acronym--it means very
important. I hope this is okay.
CRONUS
Your idea of accommodation is pitiful.
DANIEL
Well, it's the best we...
YU
(outside the room)
We will not stand for this!
[Cronus leaves the room.]
CRONUS
What is this about?
[Teal'c, Nirrti and Yu are standing in the corridor.]
CRONUS
(to Teal'c)
Sholva!
TEAL'C
Onak holka shaka!
CRONUS
Treena arik croonaka shol'va!
[Daniel moves to stand between Teal'c and Cronus.]
DANIEL
(to Teal'c)
What's going on?
NIRRTI
Your crude surveillance devices were poorly hidden in our quarters.
DANIEL
Well that's because they weren't hidden. They're...
[Yu hands him a damaged surveillance camera.]
DANIEL
...security cameras and they're for your own safety.
TEAL'C
As I was trying to explain.
CRONUS
I will not be spied on upon!
NIRRTI
Nor will I.
DANIEL
Well no offence was meant by it, it's merely a security precaution.
I'll ask if we can remove the cameras from the rooms, but we'd
definitely like to leave them in the halls.
[Cronus nods in assent, and Nirrti and Yu also give their permission.]
CRONUS
(to Teal'c)
Do not show your face to me again, shol'va.
TEAL'C
Kelmar tokeem.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Teal'c and Daniel are walking down the stairs.]
TEAL'C
As First Prime of Apophis I often did battle with the Jaffa of
Cronus.
DANIEL
Well, you must have battled lots of rival Goa'ulds. I'm sorry
Teal'c, that looked a little more personal to me.
[They stand looking down at the Stargate.]
TEAL'C
My father was once First Prime of Cronus. When I was but a child,
Cronus commanded my father to attack a Goa'uld who was more powerful
at the time. It was an impossible battle to win. When all was
inevitably lost, Cronus killed my father as punishment and exiled my
mother and I. We fled to Chulak. I vowed I would become the
strongest Jaffa I could, so one day I could be named First Prime of
Apophis, sworn enemy of Cronus.
[Hammond enters the room.]
HAMMOND
I trust our guests are settled.
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld demanded the security cameras be removed from their
quarters.
HAMMOND
I assume you told them no.
DANIEL
Actually, sir, I kind of told them it'd be okay. I told them we'd
have to leave them in the halls, sort of a...compromise.
HAMMOND
If you think it's absolutely necessary.
DANIEL
Yes.
[Hammond returns to his office.]
DANIEL
(to Teal'c)
Are you going to be okay?
TEAL'C
I will.
INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
[Carter walks over to O'Neill who is buttoning up his uniform.]
CARTER
Just wanted to wish you luck, sir.
O'NEILL
Thank you Captain. Major.
CARTER
Nervous?
O'NEILL
I wouldn't call it nervous...confused. I have no idea why I'm here.
CARTER
Well the Asgard obviously have confidence in you, sir, as do the
rest of us. I know I couldn't do it.
O'NEILL
Why?
CARTER
Well, I didn't want to say anything, because I wasn't sure until I
saw his face, but I think Cronus is the one who sent the Ashrak to
kill Jolinar. I just hate having them here.
O'NEILL
Major, I hate having them anywhere.
[Daniel enters the room, followed by Cronus, Nirrti and Yu.]
O'NEILL
Oops.
CARTER
(to O'NEILL)
Good luck.
[As she leaves, the Goa'uld begin to take their seats at the table.]
O'NEILL
(to the Goa'uld)
Hello, come on in. Have a seat. Thank you Doctor Jackson.
Hello...Yu. Well, I guess we're just...
[Thor appears in a flash of light.]
O'NEILL
And here he is. Gang's all here. You all know each other. Guess we
can get started.
THOR
The Asgard High Council wishes you all greetings and thanks for this
opportunity to negotiate for peace.
YU
The Goa'uld System Lords are prepared to hear the Asgard proposal.
NIRRTI
Onak arik kree.
CRONUS
Koracca aseemu!
[Yu thumps his fist on the table.]
YU
Kornak kree! Keena arik Asgard!
O'NEILL
(to Thor)
I thought we were all going to speak the same language here.
[Cronus angrily gets to his feet.]
CRONUS
(to O'Neill)
Gonach!
[He leaves the room, followed by Nirrti and Yu.]
O'NEILL
What? What did I say?
THOR
You insulted them.
O'NEILL
I insulted them?
THOR
By speaking out of turn. This was to be expected.
O'NEILL
What are you talking about? They were yelling at each other before I
said a word.
THOR
The System Lords have a fragile relationship with one another, as do
we with them.
O'NEILL
You mean they're always like that?
[Daniel enters the room.]
DANIEL
Excuse me, sorry for interrupting. What just happened?
O'NEILL
Apparently we said hello, insulted each other and broke for recess.
(To Thor)
Can I ask you something? Why did you let the Goa'uld get that much
power in the first place? I mean, if you've got the technology...
THOR
We are not proud of the fact that we have been forced to ignore the
situation as long as we have. But you must understand, there are
other concerns for the Asgard. We have an enemy in our home galaxy
that is far worse than the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Worse?
THOR
I cannot explain further. For now, we use what limited resources we
can spare to enforce these treaties with the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
What happens if a rogue Goa'uld like Sokar, who's been banished by
the System Lords, decides to come after us?
THOR
In order to maintain the treaty, the System Lords would attempt to
prevent it. Our greatest advantage has been the feudal nature of the
Goa'uld. Our greatest concern has been a single Goa'uld rising to
dominant power. If Sokar were to overtake the System Lord
collective, the Asgard may not have sufficient power to stop him.
O'NEILL
So basically, you guys are...bluffing the Goa'uld. Big time. So far
they've been so busy badgering each other, they've bought it.
THOR
I must return to my ship now. It will take time before the System
Lords will be willing to reconvene. You may contact me with this.
[He hands O'NEILL a glowing stone-like object.]
THOR
It will work as long as my ship is in orbit.
O'NEILL
How?
THOR
Hold it in your hand and speak.
O'NEILL
Thanks.
DANIEL
(to Thor)
We appreciate what you're doing.
THOR
These negotiations will not be easy. The Asgard will be required to
make great sacrifices, as will you.
[He disappears in a flash of light.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
O'NEILL
Fate of the world in my hands, and I screw it up!
SIMMS
I take it you apologised.
O'NEILL
Oh I tried. They wouldn't see me.
HAMMOND
What now?
O'NEILL
Well, Daniel typed up a formal letter, in Goa'uld, and I signed it.
That boy can really grovel if he has to.
SIMMS
It's probably part of their negotiating strategy.
O'NEILL
I hope so, cause Thor made it pretty clear that we might have to
give up something...big.
CARTER
What if it's hosts?
O'NEILL
Well now, that would be unacceptable, wouldn't it.
TEAL'C
As you have said O'Neill, the alternative could be far worse.
[Daniel enters the room.]
DANIEL
They're ready.
INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
[O'Neill takes his seat at the table.]
YU
We accept the apology of the human representative and agree to hear
the Asgard proposal.
THOR
In return for Earth's inclusion in the Protected Planets Treaty,
Addendum 10815, the Asgard will allow Goa'uld access to the passage
of Nilor.
YU
According to Treaty Law Section 326, no human planet will be allowed
to advance technologically to a point where they may become a threat
to the Goa'uld.
THOR
You are correct.
NIRRTI
Definition of such threat shall rest solely in the hands of the
Goa'uld System Lords.
O'NEILL
What?!
[The System Lords react.]
O'NEILL
Sorry.
(To Thor)
May I ask a question?
THOR
The human representative is recognised.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
(To the System Lords)
Are you saying you're limiting our development?
CRONUS
The treaty recognises that the human species exists for the purpose
of serving the Goa'uld as hosts and slaves.
O'NEILL
(laughing in disbelief)
Excuse me?
THOR
Do the System Lords accept the Asgard proposal?
[Both Nirrti and Cronus give their assent.]
YU
The Goa'uld System Lords...accept the Asgard proposal. We demand one
additional concession. We order the immediate and unconditional
forfeiture of the Tau'ri Stargate. Both of them.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
DANIEL
Are we seriously going to give up gate travel?
HAMMOND
Considering the alternative...
SIMMS
I believe that ring out there is the single most important thing on
this planet and I understand what losing the gate would mean. But it
is on your word that we trust these Asgard and peaceful solutions to
this crisis must be considered.
O'NEILL
True but...
CARTER
(to SIMMS)
The point is, sir, with all due respect, it's not nearly as simple
as you put it.
TEAL'C
(to Simms)
There are other threats to this world this treaty will not protect
you from.
O'NEILL
From what my buddy Thor tells me, an enemy far worse than the
Goa'uld.
SIMMS
If any of you can tell me absolutely why we should not accept this
proposal, I will forward your opinion to the President, and I assure
you it will be given serious weight.
INT--ASGARD SHIP
[O'Neill is beamed up onto the Asgard ship.]
THOR
Have your people reached a decision?
O'NEILL
Um...not yet. It's kind of why I'm here. I was wondering what you
think we should do.
THOR
It is your decision.
O'NEILL
I see. Or do I? Do you guys...do you ever say one thing and mean
another, kind of speak between the lines, if you know what I mean?
THOR
I do not.
O'NEILL
Do not what? Speak between the lines or understand?
THOR
What do you, O'Neill, think your people should do?
O'NEILL
See, I don't know. It's a bit much for one guy to make that call for
an entire planet. On the other hand, it's pretty obvious...give up
the Stargate or be destroyed.
THOR
So it would seem.
O'NEILL
But you see, the Goa'uld could call your bluff, attack us anyway,
and we'd have given up our only means of finding a way of defending
ourselves.
THOR
That is true.
O'NEILL
Oh come on, give me something! Anything! I won't hold you to it. A
little head nod, if there's another way around this.
THOR
It is your planet at stake. I believe you have it within you to make
the right decision.
O'NEILL
All right. Send me back.
[Thor bows his head.]
O'NEILL
Wait! Right there! Is that a head nod? A nod is usually down then
back up, you kinda just went down...Wait, I...
[He is cut off as the light surrounds him and beams him away.]
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
SIMMS
(speaking on the phone)
Yes, I understand.
[He replaces the receiver.]
SIMMS
We accept the terms.
O'NEILL
Daniel, you want to tell them we're ready?
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
VOICE
(over intercom)
Security to Level 25. Medical team to Level 25. Emergency.
[Daniel starts running towards the area.]
SOLDIER
(to Daniel)
In here, sir.
[Nirrti and Yu are standing in the corridor as Daniel rushes by.]
NIRRTI
I demand to know the meaning of these sounds...
DANIEL
Please just stay in your rooms for a moment.
[He stops outside Cronus' room and sees Teal'c and Cronus lying
unconscious on the floor. Teal'c has a head wound which has bled
heavily.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is checking at Teal'c's condition as he lies unconscious in a
bed.]
FRAISER
His vitals are stable, but he took quite a blow to the head. There's
some intercranial swelling.
O'NEILL
Junior taking care of it?
FRAISER
Yes, his larval Goa'uld is assisting in the healing process.
Hopefully, there isn't any permanent brain damage. But we won't know
that until he wakes up.
HAMMOND
How long?
FRAISER
That's up to him.
O'NEILL
What about Cronus?
[They head over to where Cronus is lying in a bed.]
FRAISER
Oh, he should only be so lucky. Severe internal injuries and his
host is dying.
O'NEILL
Shouldn't his snake be taking care of him?
FRAISER
Based on what I've learned about Goa'uld physiology, the symbiote
cannot heal injuries this severe on its own. We're doing everything
we can, but I don't think he's going to make it. Could be hours,
could be minutes.
[Carter rushes in.]
CARTER
I have the security videotape. You'll want to see this.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[They watch the events leading up to the attack on Cronus and Teal'c,
captured on the security cameras. They see Teal'c enter Cronus' room.]
CARTER
The SFs assigned to guard the hallway sounded the alarm. They say
Teal'c passed them and told them he was going to see Cronus.
DANIEL
Well Nirrti and Yu are demanding an explanation.
O'NEILL
Do we tell them?
CARTER
Well, based on the video tape evidence it looks like Teal'c is
involved. Not that I believe he's responsible for this.
DANIEL
Well, I don't believe for a minute that Teal'c would sacrifice our
interest for a personal vendetta.
O'NEILL
What...personal vendetta?
DANIEL
Well, apparently Teal'c and Cronus have some pretty heavy history.
HAMMOND
Such as?
DANIEL
Cronus killed Teal'c's father.
O'NEILL
Oh for crying out loud! Why doesn't he tell us these things? Why
didn't you tell us?
DANIEL
He confided in me.
CARTER
I still don't think Teal'c would do this.
O'NEILL
Well neither do I. But the case against him just got a little more
interesting, don't you think?
DANIEL
Well, we have to tell the other Goa'uld something.
FRAISER
Yes, and if we lie we could make things worse.
HAMMOND
Doctor?
FRAISER
Sir, the point is maybe the Goa'ulds can do something for Cronus
that I can't.
HAMMOND
Let's tell the Goa'uld what we know. Major, find out what really
happened.
CARTER
Yes sir.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Nirrti and Yu are brought in to see Cronus, who is still unconscious.]
NIRRTI
You will pay for this!
O'NEILL
We know it looks bad.
HAMMOND
But we're not sure what actually transpired.
YU
Whoever is responsible for this atrocity must be brought before us.
DANIEL
We're trying to figure out exactly what happened right now.
NIRRTI
All the people of your planet will suffer greatly as punishment for
this crime.
O'NEILL
All right, just hang on a second before you go dooming everybody...
DANIEL
We brought you here because we want to know if there's anything
either of you can do for him.
FRAISER
He's dying.
YU
We can do nothing here in your primitive facilities.
DANIEL
Okay, can you use one these?
[He hands Nirrti a healing device, and she passes the glowing device
over Cronus' body. She then takes the device off and hands it back to
Daniel.]
NIRRTI
His injuries are too severe. The only way to save him is with a
sarcophagus.
O'NEILL
Okay, we don't have one of those.
YU
Then we will prepare to leave. Immediately.
[He and Nirrti leave the room.]
INT--ASGARD SHIP
THOR
You must let them take Cronus.
O'NEILL
They'll attack us.
THOR
If you hold them against their will, the rest of the System Lords
will attack regardless.
O'NEILL
Look, Teal'c didn't do this.
THOR
I have been instructed by the Asgard High Council to leave Earth's
orbit.
O'NEILL
And that's what, in line with your policy of limited benevolence?
THOR
I have explained our position. To borrow from a human euphemism, it
is not a perfect galaxy.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well I'm sorry, I get a little testy when faced with the total
annihilation of our little corner of it.
THOR
We sympathise with your situation.
O'NEILL
Right. And yet you'll still just sit by and watch them destroy us.
THOR
We cannot interfere without beginning a much larger war that cannot
be won at this time.
INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
YU
We command that you release us!
NIRRTI
We must leave now and take Cronus before his death is on your heads.
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, I can't let you go.
NIRRTI
If we do not report back, your planet will suffer the full force of
the System Lords' wrath.
HAMMOND
That's going to happen whether we let you go or not.
YU
You have violated every code mandated for these negotiations. The
Asgard will not protect you!
O'NEILL
Actually you're wrong about something. There's one rule we haven't
broken yet.
[Half a dozen SGC Soldiers enter the room, armed with guns.]
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
SIMMS
Do we have any idea of what sort of time frame surrounds this
impending attack?
[Hammond shakes his head.]
SIMMS
The President is readying a statement to the United Nations. From
what you're telling me Earth should begin preparing for this
onslaught immediately.
O'NEILL
Boy did this get out of hand.
[The phone rings and Hammond answers it.]
HAMMOND
Hammond. Thank you.
[He replaces the receiver.]
HAMMOND
(to the others)
Teal'c is conscious.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is lying awake in a bed. His face is bruised and bloody, and
one side of his head is bandaged.]
TEAL'C
Cronus requested my presence.
O'NEILL
So you went alone.
TEAL'C
It is what he requested. When I arrived he denied making the
request. Before I could leave we were attacked.
CARTER
By whom?
TEAL'C
An invisible force.
O'NEILL
Invisible force.
DANIEL
A Reetou?
HAMMOND
Could one have come through the gate with the Goa'ulds?
CARTER
Sir, we could break out the transphase eradication rods and do a
sweep of the base.
TEAL'C
I did not sense the presence of a Reetou.
O'NEILL
I almost wish you had.
CARTER
Teal'c, are you aware of any of the Goa'uld having some sort of
stealth technology?
TEAL'C
I am not.
DANIEL
Hathor had the ability to appear and disappear.
O'NEILL
Okay, she's dead. Right? Please tell me she's dead.
CARTER
Yeah.
TEAL'C
I did not attack Cronus.
DANIEL
Well, we believe you Teal'c, but I just don't think anyone else is
going to.
O'NEILL
Certainly not those lying, scheming, no good for nothing, slimy,
over-dressed style mongers...
CARTER
Sir, I'd like to try something.
[She hurries out of the room.]
O'NEILL
(to the others)
I wasn't finished.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter is attempting to use the healing device on Cronus.]
FRAISER
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
CARTER
I've made it work before just not on a living...thing.
[She attempts to activate the device but it doesn't work.]
O'NEILL
Uh, I hate to go all...Freudian on you here. The part of you that
knows how to run those things...
CARTER
You think I don't want to cure Cronus because he ordered Jolinar's
death. I just have the memories of Jolinar, she doesn't control me.
I'm well aware of the stakes here.
O'NEILL
I'm just saying.
[Carter tries again and this time manages to activate the device. She
passes it over Cronus' body.]
CARTER
It worked.
[Cronus opens his eyes.]
CRONUS
You have healed me...human. I am sure you spared my life only to
prevent your own destruction.
O'NEILL
Hey! We didn't do this to you. And we saved your snaky little butt
because we want the treaty to happen.
CRONUS
That is not possible now. Nirrti and Yu have undoubtedly blamed the
Tauri for this attack on me.
O'NEILL
Good catch. Look, it's obvious to everybody that one of them did
this to you. What if I can prove which one, what's that worth to
you?
CRONUS
What do you ask in return?
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
CARTER
(to Hammond)
We can't prove anything, sir. All we know for sure is that Nirrti
lied.
O'NEILL
Cronus doesn't know that and Nirrti doesn't know what else we know.
DANIEL
Which is nothing.
O'NEILL
Right. But she doesn't know we know nothing.
HAMMOND
What are you suggesting?
O'NEILL
I'm just saying maybe it's time we take a page out of the Asgard
book on dealing with these...Goa'ulds.
DANIEL
You're going to bluff.
HAMMOND
Sounds risky Colonel.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
[Nirrti and Yu are sitting at the table, under armed guard.]
O'NEILL
(to Nirrti)
You lied to us about being able to heal Cronus with that hand
device.
NIRRTI
I tried honestly and failed. I was willing to save Cronus by taking
him to a sarcophagus.
O'NEILL
Maybe you were, maybe you weren't. But the fact is you are the only
Goa'uld here who has the technology to become invisible.
NIRRTI
(jumping to her feet)
That is a lie!
O'NEILL
Who's lying? We called the Tok'ra.
DANIEL
They say you've been experimenting with phase shifting in order to
battle the Reetou.
[Yu stands.]
YU
(to Nirrti, angrily)
You did not share this technology with the System Lords?
NIRRTI
They are lying!
YU
You dare attack Cronus and defile our meeting with the Asgard?
NIRRTI
It's not true!
YU
You are the one who opposed this treaty. You have long coveted
Cronus' territory.
NIRRTI
Go'tak!
[Snarling with rage, Yu grabs Nirrti who suddenly disappears. The
guards at the door are knocked down and one of their guns taken.]
O'NEILL
Look out!
[He pushes Yu to the floor as Nirrti opens fire on the room. Nirrti
runs down the corridor to the elevator, but Carter corners her. Using
the TER, Carter is able to see Nirrti's position.]
CARTER
Drop the weapon. You ever seen one of these things work? Cause
there's nothing more I would like to do right now than demonstrate.
[Nirrti places her gun on the floor and raises her hands in surrender.]
INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
[Yu is fingering the sleeve of his robe, where he has been struck by a
bullet. Carter and two guards bring in the captured Nirrti.]
O'NEILL
(to Yu)
Cronus said he'd support the Treaty and we wouldn't have to give up
our Stargate. I was kind of hoping we could count on your vote.
[Yu nods his assent.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activates. Cronus and Yu, Nirrti held prisoner between
them, head up the Gate ramp. O'Neill and Daniel are standing at the
bottom of the ramp, witnessing their departure. Before he enters the
gate, Cronus turns back to the Gate room.]
CRONUS
We will not attack your world. But...if you continue to use your
Stargate, be warned--anyone who is caught by one of the System Lords
will be shown no mercy. They will suffer greatly.
O'NEILL
Well that certainly makes life more...interesting.
[The Goa'uld System Lords disappear through the gate, watched by
Defense Secretary Simms.]
DANIEL
Boy is she going to get it.
O'NEILL
My heart bleeds.
EXT--ASGARD SHIP
[Thor's ship leaves Earth's orbit.]
FADE OUT
