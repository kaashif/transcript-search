TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--ALIEN PLANET, WOODS (DAY)
[SG-1 are walking through the woods, searching for a downed UAV.]
O'NEILL
You know, that UAV needs a swift kick in the CPU.
CARTER
Its aerial camera showed some sort of camp.
[There is the sound of a battle ahead and SG-1 take cover.]
CARTER
That sounded like weapons fire.
TEAL'C
Could have been a staff weapon blast.
[SG-1 quickly head towards the sounds. They take cover behind an
embankment and watch as a battle unfolds below them. Carter looks
through her binoculars and sees an unidentified SG unit exchanging fire
with Jaffa.]
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
They're SG teams, sir. Can't make out their unit number. They're
pinned down.
[She hands her binoculars to O'Neill, who watches as the unidentified
SG unit takes cover behind a cluster of boulders.]
TEAL'C
They are not returning fire.
CARTER
Out of ammo?
O'NEILL
Maybe. They're not supposed to be here at all.
DANIEL
SG-11?
CARTER
They were declared MIA months ago, on P89 354. What would they be
doing here?
TEAL'C
Whoever they may be, they are about to die.
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Unidentified Sierra Gulf Unit, this is Sierra Gulf One. We're on
your six. Standing by to offer fire support. Over.
[There is no reply over the radio.]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Sierra Gulf Unit, your position is about to be overrun. Over.
[The unidentified SG unit still fails to respond.]
O'NEILL
All right. They're either on a different frequency or they don't
have coms. RV at the tree line. Move. Now.
[Keeping low, SG-1 crawl down the embankment and take cover behind a
group of rocks, close to the unidentified SG unit.]
O'NEILL
(to the SG unit's captain)
Pull out! We'll cover your six!
CAPTAIN
Identify yourself!
O'NEILL
Colonel Jack O'Neill, SG-1!
CAPTAIN
Which Quadrant?
[One of the unidentified SG soldiers is hit by staff weapons' fire.]
O'NEILL
Get out of there!
CAPTAIN
(to his men)
Take them out!
[Two soldiers in SG uniform appear out of hatches in the ground and
fire upon SG-1. Taken by surprise, each member of SG-1 is hit by red
bolts of energy. They collapse and are left unmoving in the clearing.]
END OF TEASER
INT--MEDICAL TENT
[SG-1 are lying unconscious and unarmed in the Medical Tent. They
gradually start to come round.]
O'NEILL
Everybody ok?
DANIEL
Headache. Bad headache.
CARTER
I thought I got shot.
TEAL'C
So it would seem.
CARTER
Must be some kind of stun weapons.
O'NEILL
Looked like MP-5s to me. Well, all I can say is...
[A young soldier enters the tent, dressed in an SG uniform.]
O'NEILL
(to the soldier)
Hello.
SOLDIER
Boy, are you guys going to get it.
O'NEILL
Get what? From whom?
SOLDIER
(to O'Neill)
Hey you can't talk!
O'NEILL
Why not?
SOLDIER
Because you're dead.
O'NEILL
Dead?
SOLDIER
Pretending not to be dead will just get you into more trouble.
O'NEILL
More trouble than dead?
SOLDIER
Come on Colonel, you know better. Stop breaking the rules.
O'NEILL
Sorry. Who's in charge here?
SOLDIER
Casualties don't ask questions.
CARTER
Uh, what rules are we talking about exactly?
[The soldier walks over to her and charges his weapon, aiming it at
her.]
SOLDIER
(to Carter)
I said, stop it!
DANIEL
We're just trying to understand, if we're supposed to be dead, how
are you supposed to kill us again?
SOLDIER
(pointing his gun at Daniel)
You want to find out, Four-Eyes, huh?
DANIEL
Four-eyes?
O'NEILL
(to Daniel)
Easy, big fella. Just...play dead.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
SOLDIER
Captain's waiting for you. Follow me.
[He heads out of the tent.]
O'NEILL
Anyone notice the patch?
CARTER
SGX.
TEAL'C
There is no SGX O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Not under Hammond's command, no.
[The soldier reappears.]
SOLDIER
Hey! I said, follow me.
[He leaves the tent once more. O'Neill shrugs and SG-1 heads out of the
tent.]
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[The soldier leads SG-1 through what appears to be a military training
compound. Teams of very young soldiers are climbing ropes and doing
various training exercises. A group of soldiers jog passed SG-1.]
O'NEILL
(to the soldiers)
Hey guys.
TEAL'C
They are no more than children.
CARTER
Playing some kind of war game, by the looks of things. Who do you
think they are? NID? Colonel Mayborne?
O'NEILL
I wouldn't put it passed him.
[The soldier leads them to another tent. The captain, who had
previously ordered them shot, is sitting at a table with his back to
them.]
SOLDIER
SG-1 reporting as ordered, sir!
CAPTAIN
(to SG-1)
You were all casualties until fourteen hundred hours?
O'NEILL
Would that be Daylight Savings or Standard?
CAPTAIN
You may not speak. Except to answer a direct question by the
evaluating officer.
[He rises to his feet and faces O'Neill.]
CAPTAIN
(to O'Neill)
Is that clear? Is this the way you behave in your quadrant, mister?
O'NEILL
I think Colonel is the proper way of addressing me...Captain.
CAPTAIN
No rank is above strict adherence to the Rules of Engagement. Rule
2, Article 4. Unauthorized forces shall be shot, on sight. You were
unauthorized. In fact, you ruined our ambush. Nearly half the enemy
team got away!
O'NEILL
Carter, I've never been real big on regs, is this familiar to you?
CARTER
No, sir.
TEAL'C
They are familiar to me.
(to the captain)
Kel vak Jaffa.
CAPTAIN
(surprised)
You're not from D-Quadrant.
TEAL'C
We are not.
CAPTAIN
You came through the Chapp'ai. This is a Challenge!
DANIEL
The...Chapp'ai?
O'NEILL
Oi.
SOLDIER
(to his captain)
You meant the Stargate, sir.
CAPTAIN
Stargate. Of course. We've been so long without challenges.
(to Teal'c)
I am sorry, Master Jaffa. I have revealed myself and failed.
[He hands Teal'c his sidearm.]
CAPTAIN
(cont'd)
You must execute me for the remainder of the day.
[The SOLDIER gives his MP-5 to O'Neill.]
SOLDIER
You must execute me as well.
[O'Neill checks the weapon.]
O'NEILL
Master Teal'c. Might I suggest we...spare them this time?
TEAL'C
Very well...underling. captain, your full name and rank.
CAPTAIN
My Earth name is Captain Kyle Rogers! Acting Quadrant A Commander!
Sir!
CARTER
Your Earth name?
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
Your standing orders given to you by your previous Jaffa Master.
ROGERS
To practice the exercises of battle according to the Rules of
Engagement, until the return of our Lord Apophis!
DANIEL
Really.
ROGERS
When we are ready for the Final Challenge, he will come.
O'NEILL
Don't hold your breath.
ROGERS
We will be ready.
CARTER
You're training to serve Apophis wearing SG uniforms?
ROGERS
To know the enemy. Quadrant A is spared no detail. We've studied
long and hard and know much.
CARTER
About Earth.
ROGERS
Oh yes. Corn and cotton are indigenous to North America.
O'NEILL
And that information could save your life one day.
ROGERS
So you see, Master Teal'c, my mistake will not happen again. I am
ready to infiltrate the Tau'ri at your command.
TEAL'C
That time is not yet come, Captain Rogers.
DANIEL
(to Rogers)
So, if you're pretending to be...Who were those Jaffa attacking you?
ROGERS
They were led by my Second-in-Command, Captain Nelson, as part of
the daily exercise. We have kept the Jaffa encampment separate so
that we may better practice our Earth behavior. Shall I have him
sent for?
DANIEL
No, I don't think that'll be necessary.
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
Send for him.
DANIEL
Yes! Send for him.
[The young SOLDIER is sent to fetch Nelson.]
ROGERS
How else may I serve?
O'NEILL
We'd like our weapons back. The ones we came with.
ROGERS
They were stored in the Armory Tent, at the conclusion of this
morning's war game.
TEAL'C
Take us to them.
ROGERS
As you wish.
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[SG-1 follows Captain Rogers through the training camp.]
CARTER
Colonel, none of them have symbiote patches.
O'NEILL
I noticed that.
TEAL'C
Before Apophis requested asylum from the Tau'ri, there were but a
handful of loyal Jaffa remaining in his service.
DANIEL
So he drafted ordinary humans?
TEAL'C
It is common practice among the Goa'uld to use humans as fodder
during battle. Especially when facing defeat.
INT--ARMOURY TENT
[SG-1 follows Rogers into the Armory Tent. Inside there are racks
containing rows of what appear to be SG issue weaponry.]
O'NEILL
(to Rogers)
All right, Captain, we can handle it from here.
ROGERS
I can assist you.
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
Shel'kek.
ROGERS
Yes Master.
[He leaves the tent. SG-1 start to search for their own missing
weapons.]
O'NEILL
So Teal'c. How do you know about these Rules of Engagement?
TEAL'C
They are the code of battle during a young Jaffa's training. Spoken
by Apophis himself.
CARTER
Teal'c, what about these?
[She holds up one of the MP-5s.]
TEAL'C
They are intar.
O'NEILL
Short for?
TEAL'C
Intar. They are used for training and only meant to stun. They can
be identified by this crystal.
(He points out a red crystal set in the base of the gun's clip)
They can take the form of any weapon.
CARTER
Well, I got our GDO's, but my MP-5 is still missing.
TEAL'C
As is my staff weapon.
O'NEILL
All right, Teal'c, I want everyone in one place. Just to make sure.
Can you handle that?
TEAL'C
I can.
O'NEILL
(to Carter and Daniel)
You two keep looking.
[He and Teal'c head out of the tent.]
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[Captain Rogers is waiting for them outside the tent.]
TEAL'C
Captain Rogers. Where are the weapons with which we arrived?
ROGERS
They were returned to the Armory Tent of course.
[Teal'c glances at O'Neill, who shakes his head.]
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
Do you possess a vocume?
ROGERS
Yes, sir.
TEAL'C
Use it.
ROGERS
Yes, Master Teal'c.
[Rogers heads over to another tent and enters it.]
O'NEILL
What did you tell him to do?
TEAL'C
I instructed him to use a training instrument to assemble his men
for inspection. It may serve to emphasize our authority.
[Rogers reappears with a small, grey sphere and places it on the ground
before his men, activating it. A beam of energy shoots up into the sky
and forms a giant, holographic image of Apophis.]
APOPHIS' IMAGE
Warriors of Apophis, assemble before me and listen to he that
possesses the vocume.
[Carter and Daniel come running out of the tent in alarm at hearing
Apophis' voice.]
CARTER
Sir?
O'NEILL
Just a huge honkin' Apophis, Major. Nothing to worry about.
[Rogers and his men, dressed as both SG soldiers and Jaffa, gather
before the hologram.]
APOPHIS' IMAGE
The warrior before you speaks in my name. Heed his words.
[The hologram breaks up and vanishes.]
ROGERS
(to Teal'c)
I would be honored if you would inspect my warriors, Master.
[Teal'c signals his assent.]
ROGERS
Company!
[The young warriors come to attention.]
TEAL'C
Ready weapons for inspection.
[The warriors hold up their weapons. Teal'c and O'Neill walk along
their ranks searching for any weapon missing an intar's red crystal.]
TEAL'C
You do yourself proud, Captain Rogers.
ROGERS
Master Teal'c.
[He draws Teal'c's attention to another young warrior, dressed as a
Jaffa.]
ROGERS
This is my Second-in-Command, Novar. For the games, he leads the
side of the Jaffa warriors. His Earth name is Captain Nelson.
NELSON
(to Teal'c)
Most of my warriors are engaged in the day's battle, Master. I will
relay your words to them after the battle.
O'NEILL
Master Teal'c...if I may?
TEAL'C
(addressing the warriors)
This is Colonel O'Neill. He is much loved by Apophis.
(to O'Neill)
You may address the warriors.
O'NEILL
(to the warriors)
Apophis wanted me to tell you that you've all been doing a wonderful
job. Couldn't ask for more. Well done. But, he also wanted me to
tell you the whole...invasion of the Tau'ri idea has been canceled
due to...rain.
[The warriors appear confused.]
O'NEILL
So. The war games are officially over as of right...
[He checks for a watch, but finds he isn't wearing one.]
O'NEILL
(cont'd)
...now. You can all go home.
NELSON
Sir?
O'NEILL
It's over, Nelson. Go tell your buddies to quit fighting.
[Nelson shares a suspicious look with Rogers.]
NELSON
You speak more like a Tau'ri than a warrior of Apophis.
O'NEILL
Thanks. You're not so bad yourself. Who taught you?
NELSON
If you are who you say you are, you already know the answer to that,
sir.
O'NEILL
Nelson, I am ordering you to recall your men from the field.
NELSON
Article 7, Section 3 clearly states that once the battle has
commenced, it cannot be stopped.
O'NEILL
Well, you're obviously referring to the old Article 7.
INT--ARMOURY TENT
[Carter replaces an intar back onto the rack.]
CARTER
That's it.
DANIEL
That means those kids are out there playing war games with real
weapons.
CARTER
(into her radio)
Colonel?
O'NEILL
(over the radio)
Go ahead Carter.
CARTER
(into her radio)
So far, all we've recovered is one 9 millimeter and one MP-5.
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
O'NEILL
(to Carter, into his radio)
Roger that. Keep looking.
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
I require all of Quadrant A to be assembled, including those engaged
in the games.
[Rogers doesn't move.]
TEAL'C
Immediately!
ROGERS
As Captain Nelson stated, Master...
TEAL'C
(angrily)
Do you wish to be punished?
[Rogers still refuses to do as Teal'c instructs.]
ROGERS
I'll not fail your Challenge a second time, Master Teal'c.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Tell them the truth.
TEAL'C
(addressing the warriors)
Warriors of Apophis. Hear me. Apophis has been slain in battle with
his enemies.
[The warriors assembled don't react to this.]
O'NEILL
(to the warriors)
Hey! He's telling you the truth. The battle you've been preparing
for is never going to happen. He's not coming back.
[The warriors still don't respond.]
O'NEILL
(Quietly)
Hello? Is this mike on?
(Loudly, to the warriors)
We're trying to tell you something important here!
ROGERS
Apophis is a god. And gods cannot die. Therefore, Apophis cannot be
dead.
NELSON
(to O'Neill)
And anyone who says otherwise is either testing us...or is a
traitor. Sir.
ROGERS
Now we've passed your Challenge. If there's nothing else, sirs,
we're scheduled to join the games in progress.
(to the warriors)
Company! Dismissed!
[The warriors fall out to either continue with their training or head
off to join the current battle.]
TEAL'C
(to O'Neill)
Apophis has lived for thousands of years. It is as if we have said
the sun will never rise again.
O'NEILL
It just might not for some of those kids if they don't wise up.
INT--ARMOURY TENT
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter to find Carter aiming an intar at the young
soldier who they first met in the Medical Tent.]
O'NEILL
What's going on?
SOLDIER
I'm trying to get a weapon, sir. I'm already late, the games have
started.
CARTER
Colonel, one MP-5, Teal'c's staff weapon and two 9 millimeters are
still unaccounted for.
[Outside, a horn is blown.]
DANIEL
What does that mean?
SOLDIER
It means my team needs reinforcements.
O'NEILL
No. The game is canceled.
SOLDIER
You can't do that!
O'NEILL
I believe I can.
[He takes the intar from Carter and shoots the young soldier.]
O'NEILL
(to SG-1)
Everybody grab an intar.
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[SG-1 and Captain Rogers cautiously make their way through the woods.
They discover a body in SG uniform. Carter hurries over to the fallen
soldier.]
CARTER
It's a staff weapon wound.
[She checks for a pulse, but doesn't find one.]
CARTER
(shocked)
He's dead, sir.
[A blast from a real staff weapon strikes the ground close to SG-1.]
O'NEILL
Take cover!
[Their assailant fires again.]
ROGERS
Colonel! I'll draw his fire.
O'NEILL
Negative! That is a real weapon.
ROGERS
Apophis will protect me.
O'NEILL
I said stay down!
[Rogers ignores him and run towards their attacker, opening fire with
his intar. The warrior, dressed as a Jaffa, returns fire and Rogers is
hit in the side. O'Neill shoots the warrior with his own MP-5 intar.]
O'NEILL
Secure that weapon!
CARTER
Yes, sir!
[She quickly goes to retrieve Teal'c's staff weapon from the
unconscious warrior. Rogers is lying on the ground, his clothing
smoking from the staff weapon blast. Daniel hurries over to him.]
ROGERS
(to Daniel, in pain)
Have I displeased Apophis?
DANIEL
No.
TEAL'C
(to Rogers)
Apophis would be proud.
[Rogers nods, then lifts his hand from his wound, seeing blood on his
fingers.]
ROGERS
This is the Final Challenge.
[A group of warriors, led by Nelson, hurry over.]
NELSON
What happened?
ROGERS
The day has come, Nelson. It's the Final Challenge.
[Nelson touches Rogers' wound and sees blood on his fingers.]
NELSON
Blood has been shed.
ROGERS
Prepare the men. The Challenge must begin at first light.
NELSON
Yes, sir.
[Nelson heads off with the other warriors as Daniel treats Rogers'
wound.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
What's he talking about? The Final Challenge?
TEAL'C
It is a day in a warrior's training when first blood is shed. The
games become real.
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[O'Neill is heading through the camp.]
CARTER
(over the radio)
Colonel? We've found something. Our weapons were all turned back in
after the war games, sir.
O'NEILL
Roger that. Keep them secure.
[He continues on through the camp.]
INT--MEDICAL TENT
[Rogers is lying on a bed as O'Neill enters the tent.]
O'NEILL
(to Daniel)
How's he doing?
NELSON
Apophis will save him.
DANIEL
Well, actually, no. As a matter of fact, there's probably nothing
more we can do for him as long as we stay here. There's probably
internal injuries.
O'NEILL
So we'll take him back with us.
NELSON
(to O'Neill)
You cannot.
O'NEILL
For crying out loud...
NELSON
You know as well as I do, that the Rules forbid entry or exit of the
Sector before the Final Challenge. Wounded, or not.
O'NEILL
Right. Right, right.
ROGERS
(in pain)
Apophis would be disappointed in me if...if there were an exception
made for myself.
DANIEL
(to Rogers)
Well, what if I told you we were bringing you to see Apophis
personally? To show him that blood has been shed and that your
Quadrant is truly ready for his return.
[Rogers shares an uncertain look with Nelson.]
DANIEL
(cont'd)
If we don't bring you back with us, then Apophis will know you've
failed our Challenge and never return.
ROGERS
(nodding)
Then I must go.
O'NEILL
Good.
[Nelson offers Rogers his hand and Rogers takes it.]
NELSON
(to Rogers)
Tell him we will make him proud.
ROGERS
I will.
INT--SGC, GATE ROOM
[The Stargate opens and SG-1 emerges. Teal'c and Daniel are carrying
Rogers on a stretcher.]
O'NEILL
We need a medical team!
[Two medics quickly wheel in a gurney to take Rogers to the Infirmary.]
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
What happened, Colonel?
ROGERS
(to Hammond)
My Lord?
O'NEILL
Actually, we just call him...General Hammond.
ROGERS
Where is Apophis?
O'NEILL
He's not here. Sorry.
[Dr. Frasier hurries into the Gateroom.]
FRASIER
What have we got?
Rogers, realizing he has been tricked, starts to struggle with the
medics.
ROGERS
Liars! Traitors!
FRASIER
Easy, easy!
ROGERS
You will be punished. He will avenge me!
FRASIER
(to O'Neill)
Who is this, sir?
O'NEILL
His name's Rogers. Despite appearances, he's not SGC.
ROGERS
He will strike you down! You will all die!
FRASIER
(to the medics)
Go! Let's get him to the infirmary.
[They quickly wheel Rogers, who is still yelling, away.]
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
I'd like to debrief ASAP, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Yes, my Lord.
INT--SGC, DEBRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 are seated in the debriefing room, a scattering of intar weaponry
on the table before them]
HAMMOND
What's this Final Challenge all about?
TEAL'C
In my training, it is when we received our actual staff weapons. The
two opposing camps then engaged in battle until one side emerged
victorious.
CARTER
You killed each other?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld wish only the strong to prevail, Major Carter. I was
among the victors. We were then honored by Apophis and I became a
member of his Personal Guard.
HAMMOND
And that's what's about to happen to those boys.
O'NEILL
As long as they don't have real weapons with which to play, I don't
see how.
CARTER
Well the only lethal weapons I found in the Armory belonged to us.
The rest were intars.
TEAL'C
The Jaffa Masters who once supervised their war games have long ago
abandoned them. Yet they have maintained their games until this day
without fail.
DANIEL
So what are you saying?
TEAL'C
That they are extremely resourceful and most determined.
CARTER
So they might try to fulfill the Final Challenge whether they're
issued lethal weapons or not.
TEAL'C
It is possible.
DANIEL
Well let's face it, if they really wanted to kill each other they
don't need guns to do it.
CARTER
(to Hammond)
We have to go back there, sir, and try to prevent this from
happening.
DANIEL
General, we're indirectly responsible for all this. They think that
we were sent through to start this.
HAMMOND
I understand that.
O'NEILL
What we need to send back there is a team of shrinks. Those kids are
out there.
HAMMOND
That may be so, Colonel, but before I send you or anyone else into a
battle zone, I want to know what's going on on that planet.
O'NEILL
Why don't I see what I can get out of Rogers?
HAMMOND
Very well.
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
FRASIER
(to O'Neill)
He won't eat, he won't speak...except to call me a Shova.
O'NEILL
You must be doing a good job.
FRASIER
There's no internal injury. He mustn't have taken the full force of
the blast. Physically he'll be fine. Emotionally...that's another
story. He's very angry Colonel.
O'NEILL
Where's his tray?
FRASIER
Over here.
(She hands it to him)
Good luck.
[O'Neill takes the tray of food over to Rogers' bed. He picks up a
sandwich and takes a bite.]
O'NEILL
(to Rogers)
Ole Doc Frasier says you haven't been eating.
ROGERS
It's poison.
O'NEILL
It's hospital food, of course it is.
[Rogers doesn't respond. O'Neill takes another bite of the sandwich.]
O'NEILL
Mmm, tuna...
ROGERS
Go to SOKAR.
O'NEILL
It's 'Go to hell' actually. Which, by the way, is a very rude thing
to say to a person offering you a sandwich.
ROGERS
It means the same.
O'NEILL
You've got a point.
ROGERS
I will reveal nothing. You may begin torturing me.
O'NEILL
Oh, I've already begun. This...is the infamous Tuna Torture.
[He waves a plate of food under Rogers' nose.]
O'NEILL
Last chance.
[Rogers gives in and reluctantly takes the sandwich.]
O'NEILL
Good. So, you and I should have a little talk about this Final
Challenge thing.
ROGERS
We will battle to the death and Apophis will choose the victors as
his Personal Guard.
O'NEILL
All right, I'm going to tell you the absolute truth right now.
Apophis is dead.
ROGERS
Gods cannot die!
O'NEILL
Why do think he's been gone for so long? Why have all the Jaffa
Masters left? Apophis was on his way out when you got drafted.
ROGERS
You lie.
O'NEILL
What if he told you himself?
ROGERS
If Apophis can speak, then he cannot be dead.
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[A television and video recorder have been brought into the Infirmary.
Daniel inserts a tape into the VCR.]
DANIEL
(to Rogers)
When Apophis came to us, he had already been tortured.
ROGERS
Impossible. He is a god.
CARTER
The images we're about to show you are of Apophis just before he
died and his body was sent to SOKAR.
ROGERS
Gods cannot die.
O'NEILL
So you keep saying. Have a look.
[The TV is switched on. It shows a picture of an aged Apophis, taken
when he was held in the SGC infirmary.]
APOPHIS
(on the screen)
Help me. A host. I am...afraid.
[He takes a gasping breath, then dies.]
ROGERS
What magic is this?
O'NEILL
No magic. I was there.
TEAL'C
As was I.
ROGERS
Then it is true.
TEAL'C
It is.
ROGERS
What will you do to us?
CARTER
We're not going to do anything to you. We want to help you.
O'NEILL
You can go home. Wherever that is. War's over.
ROGERS
No, it's not. Because tomorrow the Final Challenge begins...and many
of my men will die. For him.
[He nods towards the image of Apophis, frozen on the television
screen.]
INT--SGC, DEBREIFING ROOM
[Rogers is siting at the end of the table as SG-1 and General Hammond
question him.]
HAMMOND
What's your real name, son?
ROGERS
My true is Rafyatre, sir.
O'NEILL
Your Earth name's Kyle, can we call you Kyle?
ROGERS
That would be fine, sir, I'm very used to that.
HAMMOND
How long have you been on that planet?
ROGERS
We were brought there through our Chapp'ai...five cycles ago from a
number of different worlds.
CARTER
Right after we blew up Apophis' ships.
ROGERS
He commanded we worship no other god but him. He left many Jaffa
warriors with us. They taught us everything.
HAMMOND
Who taught you all about Earth, our uniforms, weapons?
ROGERS
Near the beginning, Apophis captured one of your SG teams and forced
them to teach us.
CARTER
SG-11.
ROGERS
Yes. At first that was all they would reveal. Our Jaffa Masters
forced them to say things. We listened to your speech, observed your
ways. But they did not last long.
HAMMOND
What happened to them?
ROGERS
One day, their bodies were put on display in the encampment. I...do
not know how they died. Only that they refused to tell the Jaffa
Masters all that was asked of them. Then our Jaffa Masters began to
leave us, one by one. They said, to help Apophis win a great battle.
And then we were alone.
HAMMOND
Thank you for your cooperation, son.
ROGERS
May I now ask for your cooperation, sir?
HAMMOND
Go on.
ROGERS
As we speak, my men are preparing for the Final Challenge.
HAMMOND
I was under the impression your weapons are nonlethal.
ROGERS
They are. But before Master Gar'toc left, he showed Captain Nelson
and myself a cave. Inside were weapons intended for the Final
Challenge. Real weapons.
O'NEILL
What are we talking about here...weapons wise?
ROGERS
They are exactly like your own. MP-5s. He told us it was with those
that we would one day infiltrate the Tau'ri and destroy you. May I
request permission to be returned to my men, sir, to tell them what
I've learned and...to try and stop them?
DANIEL
They won't believe you, you know that.
ROGERS
They are under my command.
CARTER
Teal'c, is the vocume capable of recording other images?
TEAL'C
Yes, that is correct.
CARTER
Well then Colonel O'Neill's already thought of the solution.
(to O'Neill)
I think you know where I'm going with this, sir.
O'NEILL
Haven't a clue.
CARTER
Seeing Apophis die was enough to convince KYLE. All we have to do is
show that same image to everyone else.
HAMMOND
With the vocume device?
CARTER
Yes.
TEAL'C
I believe O'Neill's solution could be successful.
HAMMOND
In the middle of a battlefield, combining alien technology with our
own?
CARTER
Sir, the technical part of transferring the data to the vocume I can
figure out. We've already been experimenting with interfacing
Goa'uld technology with our own. The problem will be getting there.
O'NEILL
We do have the intars General.
HAMMOND
What good will they do?
O'NEILL
We could shoot first and ask questions later.
[Rogers gets to his feet.]
ROGERS
(to Hammond)
I request permission to join them. Sir.
O'NEILL
They are his men, General. And he might provide the tactical
advantage we need to pull this off.
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[SG-1 and Rogers step out of an elevator and head down the corridor.
They are wearing combat gear and camouflage paint.]
O'NEILL
Final Challenge scenario. Let's hear it one more time.
ROGERS
My elite SG squad is to defend the encampment from the invading
force of other SG teams, led by Captain Nelson. The attackers are
greater in number, but the defenders have greater firepower.
CARTER
But everyone on both sides will be in SG uniforms.
ROGERS
As it would have been when we infiltrated Earth, yes.
[They enter the Gateroom, where the Stargate has already been dialed.]
O'NEILL
All right, once we take the encampment, we become the defenders to
buy Carter time. Is everyone clear on that? Daniel?
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
Good.
(to Rogers)
You, stay with Carter, who will watch you like a hawk.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
SG-1, you have a go.
[They head up the ramp and enter the Stargate.]
VFX--SHOOTING THROUGH THE WORMHOLE
EXT--ALIEN PLANET, WOODS (DAY)
[SG-1 and Captain Rogers head silently through the woods. Sporadic
gunfire is heard in the distance. A warrior in SG uniform shoots at
them and they duck behind the trees. Rogers jumps up and runs down the
path, drawing his fire and enabling Carter to shoot their attacker with
her intar. O'Neill shoots and disables a second assailant then goes
after Rogers, grabbing him by the front of his uniform.]
O'NEILL
(to Rogers)
I told you to stay with Carter!
ROGERS
I was just trying to draw their fire.
O'NEILL
You will listen to every word I tell you and you will do everything
I tell you or I will shoot you myself! Is that clear?
[He cuffs Rogers across the head, then walks away.]
ROGERS
(quietly, to himself)
Yes, sir.
INT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[Warriors in SG uniform are patrolling the camp as SG-1 makes their way
through the compound. Rogers steps out and calls to one of his men.]
ROGERS
Status report, Sergeant!
SERGEANT
Captain Rogers?
ROGERS
I have just returned through the Chapp'ai with a message from
Apophis. I have glorious news.
[SG-1 shoots the patrolling soldiers with their intars. Rogers shoots
the sergeant with his sidearm intar.]
O'NEILL
(to Rogers)
Get the vacuum.
ROGERS
Vocume.
O'NEILL
Whatever. Get it. Carter, set it up. Teal'c with Carter, Daniel with
me.
[Rogers runs into a building to fetch the vocume, while Carter and
Teal'c head into another to set up the transfer. O'Neill and Daniel
take cover behind a wall of sandbags as attacking warriors in SG
uniforms start to come out of the trees around them.]
DANIEL
Here they come.
O'NEILL
I got some at 9 o'clock here too.
[They open fire on the approaching warriors, using their intars. Rogers
takes the vocume to Carter then runs over to help O'Neill and Daniel.]
INT--TENT, MILITARY TRAINING CAMP
[Teal'c finishes setting up the vocume. Carter is using a laptop to
transfer the data onto the device.]
TEAL'C
It is ready.
CARTER
Good. I'm not. Give me a second.
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[O'Neill ducks down as gunfire passes overhead.]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Anytime, Carter.
INT--TENT, MILITARY TRAINING CAMP
CARTER
(into her radio)
Yes, sir!
TEAL'C
What is the delay?
CARTER
(working on the laptop)
You can't just combine Goa'uld technology with ours with a snap of a
finger. I have to match the frequency the vocume operates on before
I can record and transmit.
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[Teal'c leaves the tent to go and help O'Neill and Daniel, who are busy
shooting at a sudden wave of attacking warriors.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill!
[There's high-pitched whistle.]
O'NEILL
(in realization)
Incoming!
[They quickly duck and cover as a mortar explodes in the compound,
destroying the climbing frame.]
O'NEILL
Rogers! What the hell was that?!
ROGERS
Mortars!
O'NEILL
What else is in that cave?
ROGERS
Stingers, M60s, M72s...
O'NEILL
You're telling me this now! What the hell? Get down!
[They duck as another mortar hits inside the encampment close to the
tent where Carter is still working.]
O'NEILL
Dammit! Carter!
INT--TENT, MILITARY TRAINING CAMP
[Carter finally manages to transfer the data onto the vocume.]
CARTER
Got it!
[She shuts her laptop and grabs the vocume.]
EXT--MILITARY TRAINING CAMP (DAY)
[Carter runs out of the tent with the vocume, narrowly avoiding an
exploding mortar, and plants the device in the center of the camp. The
giant image of Apophis appears.]
APOPHIS' IMAGE
Warriors of Apophis, assemble before me and listen to he that
possesses the vocume.
[The attacking warriors stop firing. They slowly come of the woods and
enter the encampment, assembling before the image of Apophis.]
APOPHIS' IMAGE
(cont'd)
The warrior before you speaks in my name. Heed his words.
ROGERS
(to the warriors)
It's a message from Apophis himself!
NELSON
Summoning his image during battle is against the Rules of
Engagement...
ROGERS
Hear his words!
NELSON
When the Challenge is over!
O'NEILL
Now, Nelson! You will listen to him now! Before anyone else gets
hurt.
NELSON
The Final Challenge is to the death, Colonel.
[Nelson looks up in astonishment as the image of Apophis changes.]
APOPHIS' IMAGE
A host. I am...afraid.
[He takes a gasping breath, then dies.]
NELSON
(shocked)
He is a god. It cannot be so.
ROGERS
It is so.
[The other soldiers start to wander around in confusion, no longer
willing to fight.]
NELSON
(to Rogers)
What will become of us? Where will we go now?
ROGERS
Home.
[He exchanges a look with SG-1 as the rest of the warriors fall out and
start to walk away.]
FADE OUT
THE END
