   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   [There is much activity around the temple.]

   INT--JAFFA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS, DAKARA

   [An elderly Jaffa is standing on a dais in the middle of the circular
   arrangement of tables, addressing the Jaffa Council. Attendees include
   Teal'c, Bra'tac, and the female Hak'tyl Ka'lel.]

     MAZ'RAI
     Democracy is the future of our great nation. We must proceed with
     the dissolution of this Council, which we have seen can be
     influenced and corrupted. I hereby formally propose we hold a public
     referendum on the subject, so that all Jaffa can participate in the
     decision before us.

   [There is murmuring among some of the Jaffa in attendance. Maz'rai
   steps off the dais and walks toward his seat. Bra'tac stands.]

     BRA'TAC
     Thank you, Brother Maz'rai. Your wisdom is always greatly
     appreciated by the Council. Now I call Sister Ka'lel as the last
     speaker before rebuttal will be heard.

   [Ka'lel, seated next to Bra'tac's chair stands and addresses him.]

     KA'LEL
     Brother Bra'tac, I'm afraid I must begin rebuttal against
     dissolution of the Council.

   [Teal'c looks up in surprise, then exchanges shocked looks with
   Bra'tac. Maz'rai looks shocked as well.]

     KA'LEL
     Our people are not yet ready for this burden, Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     You underestimate them, Sister.

     KA'LEL
     My position on this Council was secured by the might of the Hak'tyl,
     but it is well known that many regions do not yet recognize any
     rights for females, let alone the right to vote on their destiny.

     BRA'TAC

     (his hand on Teal'c's shoulder)
     I agree. There must be change.

     KA'LEL
     Such change must occur prior to a general vote, so that its results
     can be viewed as fair and representative.

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS

   [Teal'c follows Ka'lel and two others out of the chambers.]

     TEAL'C

     (calling harshly after her)
     Ka'lel. Ka'lel!

   [She continues on, ignoring him. Bra'tac and Maz'rai walk up to
   Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C

     (to Bra'tac and Maz'rai)
     Did she not just speak of her support for our proposal just this
     morning?

     BRA'TAC
     Privately, yes. I would not have called on her otherwise.

     TEAL'C
     Then why would she betray us in session?

     MAZ'RAI
     Someone has influenced her.

     TEAL'C
     Still, I have always believed Ka'lel to be honorable.

     BRA'TAC
     Is there no end to this duplicity we must face?

     MAZ'RAI
     Sometimes I fear I have gotten too old for this, Brother.

     BRA'TAC
     Indeed. And yet this is what results when we leave such decisions to
     the rash of youth.

     MAZ'RAI
     I will speak with her.

   [Maz'rai walks off.]

   INT--KA'LEL'S CHAMBER IN TEMPLE, DAKARA

   [Maz'rai enters to find Ka'lel there. He is holding a large book in
   both hands. The chamber is decorated in the Hak'tyl style, with dream
   catchers hung on the walls.]

     MAZ'RAI
     Ka'lel. Please, forgive the intrusion.

     KA'LEL

     (turning toward him, holding a metal goblet)
     Not at all. I'm glad you are here. We must speak.

     MAZ'RAI
     May I ask why you did not support our proposal?

     KA'LEL
     Now is not the time.

     MAZ'RAI
     We have no choice, Ka'lel.

     KA'LEL
     I'm afraid as far as you are concerned, that is true.

   [As she speaks, she sets the goblet down on a table, then picks up a
   Zat and aims it at him. He looks at her in shock, and she shoots him.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY HOSPITAL, DAY

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Dressed in casual civilian clothes, Mitchell strides purposefully to
   the nurses' station. He approaches a nurse standing there.]

     MITCHELL
     Hi. I'm Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell. I'm here to see Bryce Ferguson.

   [A female doctor approaches and overhears his question. She answers
   him.]

     DOCTOR KELLY
     Colonel Mitchell.

     MITCHELL
     Yes, ma'am.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     Hello. I'm Doctor Kelly.

   [They shake hands.]

     DOCTOR KELLY
     I've had a chance to see your friend.

     MITCHELL
     Great. Doctor Lam says you're the best.

     DOCTOR KELLY

     (smiling)
     Well, that's very nice of her to say. I'm not aware of any official
     ranking system.

     MITCHELL
     Well, I'm sure you'll be a little bit better than Fergy's HMO back
     in Iowa.

     DOCTOR KELLY

     (paging through a medical chart)
     Well, I'll do what I can. I've ordered some tests that should give
     us a better idea of what we're looking at.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, he's had that shrapnel for a while. They just found the
     aneurism a few weeks ago.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     He probably had it the whole time and didn't know it.

     MITCHELL
     He said his doctors back home have thrown in the towel on this one.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     I won't lie to you. It's in a tricky spot. But, as you know, we have
     access to certain technology not available to everyone else just
     yet.

     MITCHELL
     Yes, ma'am. Thanks.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     I was told he's not privy to classified material.

     MITCHELL
     No.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     So, you got him in here but you couldn't get him clearance?

     MITCHELL
     That is a whole other ball of wax. The irony is he probably would
     have had my spot in the 302 program if he hadn't been injured. He's
     a better pilot than I ever was. Better than most, actually.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     Well this must be important to you. I imagine you had to pull some
     pretty big strings to make this happen.

     MITCHELL
     Ferguson got that chunk of metal in his head saving my sorry ass
     four years ago.

     DOCTOR KELLY

     (nodding)
     I'll do what I can.

     MITCHELL
     Thanks.

   [He walks away.]

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   INT--JAFFA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS, DAKARA

   [Maz'rai is speaking to the Council again.]

     MAZ'RAI
     And so, upon further reflection, I have come to agree with Ka'lel.

   [Ka'lel smiles while Teal'c looks shocked and Bra'tac furious.]

     MAZ'RAI
     More debate over the proposed state of government is required. We
     must take our time in such grave matters. For now, we must maintain
     the present High Council and not bow to the pressure of Brothers
     Bra'tac and Teal'c.

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS

   [Bra'tac catches up with Maz'rai, who is speaking to Ka'lel. Teal'c
   stands further away.]

     BRA'TAC

     (tapping Maz'rai on the arm)
     Maz'rai.

   [Maz'rai turns to face him. Ka'lel nods and walks away. Teal'c comes to
   join Bra'tac.]

     MAZ'RAI
     I am entitled to be swayed by reason, Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     You were the one who tabled this proposal for a referendum. You have
     always believed democracy was essential for the future of our
     nation.

     MAZ'RAI
     Indeed, that is still the case. I have merely been convinced that we
     should not act in such haste.

     TEAL'C
     Brother, it was you who feared that Gerak's followers were gathering
     strength. That there was a danger that if we did not dissolve this
     Council, they could still vote to support the unilateral submission
     to the religion of the Ori.

     BRA'TAC
     All our dreams for a free Jaffa nation would be lost forever!

     MAZ'RAI
     All I'm saying is that I believe there is yet more time for healthy
     debate.

   [Maz'rai walks away.]

     BRA'TAC
     We cannot let this proposal die.

     TEAL'C
     There are still council members who remain uncommitted. Brother
     U'kin was not in session today. I will visit him later this evening,
     after I confer with our allies on Chulak.

     BRA'TAC
     And I will see what I can learn here. If Maz'rai's vote was
     influenced, I shall expose it.

   [They bow to each other, and Teal'c walks away.]

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY

   [A man dressed in jeans, tee-shirt, and an aloha overshirt is lying on
   the bed next to the window, tossing a baseball into the air and
   catching it in a baseball glove. The bed beside his is empty. Mitchell
   comes to the doorway and leans against it.]

     MITCHELL
     Ferguson!

     FERGUSON

     (barely looking at him)
     It's about time. Son of a bitch drags me out here to get poked and
     prodded and turned upside down, and he can't spare a minute from his
     big, important job to visit his dying friend?

     MITCHELL

     (entering)
     Ah, it's good to see your bad attitude hasn't changed much.

     FERGUSON

     (putting the ball and glove down)
     What do you expect. I'm dying, for God's sakes!

   [He gets up.]

     MITCHELL
     Don't get up, you idiot.

     FERGUSON
     Ah, Cam, I'm not going to break.

   [Ferguson walks over to Mitchell, and they hug.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, you look like you're feeling good.

   [Ferguson sits sideways on the bed, facing the other bed.]

     FERGUSON
     Yeah, doing pretty good, for a guy with a ticking timebomb in his
     head.

     MITCHELL
     Well, why don't we see what the doctors say about that.

   [Mitchell sets a brown grocery bag down on a table and hops up onto the
   empty bed, facing Ferguson.]

     FERGUSON
     Oh, I'm just doing what the flyer says.

   [Ferguson hands a thin paper pamphlet to Mitchell, who begins to look
   at it.]

     FERGUSON
     It was in the waiting room of the shrink's office they sent me to a
     couple weeks back. "So you're going to bite the big one. Now what?"
     First thing on the list is accept it, learn to talk openly about it.
     So, that's what I'm doing... Did I mention I'm going to die?

     MITCHELL

     (uncomfortable, but smiling slightly)
     Yeah, I think you did.

     FERGUSON
     Okay. How about you? How's the big important top-secret job?

     MITCHELL
     Still top secret.

     FERGUSON

     Oh, come on, man, you can tell me. I'm not gonna tell anyone.
     (with mock sincerity)
     I'm gonna die, you know.

   [Mitchell shakes his head.]

     FERGUSON
     No flowers?

     MITCHELL

     No. No, hell, I thought about it, but...
     (holding out the paper bag so Ferguson can see what's inside)
     ...decided on this, instead.

     FERGUSON
     Oh, yes. Me likey latte.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry is standing next to the briefing table. Bra'tac is near the
   window overlooking the gate room. Carter and Daniel enter.]

     LANDRY
     Colonel, Doctor Jackson. Bra'tac has information concerning a
     situation on Dakara.

     BRA'TAC

     (approaching Landry, speaking to Carter and Daniel)
     It is Teal'c. He left last night to consult with one of our allies.
     He was due back this morning but did not return.

     DANIEL
     You sure he's not just late?

     BRA'TAC
     He missed an important council session. There have been unusual
     goings on as of late. I'm here because I no longer know who I can
     trust on Dakara. And I'm certain something is gravely wrong.

   [The others exchange concerned looks.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c, dressed in a sleeveless metal chain mail shirt, is constrained
   against a pyramid-shaped post, his elbows bent around a straight metal
   pole behind him. His wrists are chained and there is a ring around his
   neck fastened to the post. He is unconscious but wakes slowly and
   struggles against the restraints. A Jaffa is watching him. The Jaffa
   picks up a small device from the table. It is gold, with long, curved
   spikes jutting from it. He picks up a small metal disk with his other
   hand. He approaches Teal'c, smiling evilly. He pushes the disk into
   Teal'c's right temple. Teal'c flinches then looks at the Jaffa
   fiercely.]

     TEAL'C
     I will divulge nothing.

     JAFFA COMMANDER
     That is not my intention. My purpose is to teach you.

   [He activates the device, and Teal'c cries out in pain. He tries to
   resist as the pain continues.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bra'tac, Daniel, Carter, and Landry are seated at the table.]

     BRA'TAC
     Obviously this motion to dissolve the Council in favor of elected
     officials has spawned strong opposition. Many who have reaped
     benefits under the current regime would lose their status upon
     passage of the vote.

     LANDRY
     Anybody in particular you think would resort to kidnapping and
     blackmail to influence the situation?

     BRA'TAC
     I used to believe in the honor of many who have disappointed me of
     late.

     LANDRY
     Hmmm.

     DANIEL
     Well, we should probably start at Teal'c's last known whereabouts.

     LANDRY
     Let me know if you need additional personnel. Colonel Mitchell is
     taking some personal time.

     CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY

   [Mitchell and Ferguson are playing a video game using separate
   controllers, fighting each other in separate windows on the television
   screen; it is a first-person combat game.]

     MITCHELL
     Come on, come on. No, you don't want none of me. No, you don't. Oh,
     now don't look now. You'd better back down. Die, yeah!

   [Ferguson flinches as if in pain, but Mitchell doesn't see this.
   Mitchell kills Ferguson's character in the video game.]

     MITCHELL

     That's what I'm talk--
     (noticing Ferguson has stopped playing)
     What the hell was that? You even trying?

     FERGUSON
     You know what? I'm just, I'm kinda tired. But this, this, this was
     great, really. This was just like old times.

     MITCHELL
     Tell you what. I'll play left handed with one eye.

     FERGUSON
     Yeah, I'm done.

     MITCHELL

     (putting down the controller and standing up)
     All right. Fine. I reserve the right for a rematch.

     FERGUSON
     Fair enough. Look, I, I appreciate you taking some time, but...

     MITCHELL
     What are you talking about?

     FERGUSON
     I'm just saying you did your duty. You can go now.

     MITCHELL
     I got nowhere else to be. Really.

     FERGUSON
     Seriously, Cam. It's fine. You don't have to stick around.

     MITCHELL

     (becoming serious)
     Yes.
     (turning to face the window)
     I do.

   EXT--ALLIED PLANET, DAY

   [There is a primitive camp with tents and open fires.]

   INT--U'KIN'S TENT

   [The tent has one whole wall open to the outside. Daniel and Bra'tac
   are standing at the entrance.]

     U'KIN
     I wish I could be of more help, Bra'tac, but Teal'c left last night
     barely an hour after arriving.

     DANIEL
     Did he say where he was going?

     U'KIN
     He said he was needed back on Dakara.

     DANIEL

     (unhappy with the lack of information)
     Was anybody with him?

     U'KIN

     (smoothly)
     He traveled alone. Please, let me know as you as you have learned
     what has happened.

   [Looking predatory, Bra'tac steps forward to U'Kin.]

     U'KIN
     What is the matter, Brother?

     BRA'TAC

     (smiling wolfishly)
     You call yourself a friend, yet you speak lies to my face!

   [He grabs U'kin's robes with both hands and pulls on the man hard.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa, Bra'tac!

     BRA'TAC

     He is deceiving us.
     (to U'kin)
     Where is Teal'c?

     U'KIN

     (afraid)
     Bra'tac, what has come over you? I have told you what I know.

   [Bra'tac grabs him by the throat, choking him. U'kin grunts in
   distress.]

     BRA'TAC
     I will not ask again.

     U'KIN

     (struggling to speak around Bra'tac's choke hold)
     He was taken from here. I do not know where! Ahh! Please!

   [Bra'tac finally releases him, and he puts his hand to his throat.]

   EXT--ALLIED VILLAGE, DAY

   [Daniel and Bra'tac are walking back to the Stargate.]

     DANIEL
     What was that all about?

     BRA'TAC
     I believe he speaks the truth. He does not know where Teal'c is.

     DANIEL
     But he admitted he helped arrange for Teal'c's kidnapping.

     BRA'TAC
     And he shall be dealt with accordingly. Unfortunately for us, this
     situation is much worse than I imagined.

     DANIEL

     (stopping)
     How?

     BRA'TAC
     U'kin has always been one of the strongest supporters of our cause.
     A Jaffa whose honor I never would have doubted. There is but one
     possible explanation for his actions. I saw it -- in his eyes.

     DANIEL

     (in sudden realization)
     He's been brainwashed.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY

   [Ferguson is seated on his hospital bed as Mitchell stands, playing
   with the ball and glove.]

     FERGUSON
     You know, I never did buy that you went down in a test flight.

     MITCHELL
     Why? That's what happened.

   [Mitchell sits lengthwise on the other bed and starts tossing the ball
   into the glove.]

     FERGUSON

     (incredulous)
     Okay, so you were testing a plane in a dogfight over Antarctica?

     MITCHELL
     Dogfight?

     FERGUSON
     I did some checking. I still have friends in Intelligence.

     MITCHELL
     Right. You think you're getting your hands on classified
     information, huh?

     FERGUSON
     Not exactly. I pieced some things together. Come on, we were both up
     for that big, important classified position. I just want to know
     what I missed out on that almost got you killed.

     MITCHELL
     I wish I could tell you. I really do.

     FERGUSON

     No you don't. No, you probably feel guilty as hell that you're doing
     what you're doing while I'm waiting to die.
     (continuing before Mitchell can interrupt)
     Read the flyer, man. It's called survivor's guilt.
     (cajoling)
     Now, it also says that you need to be honest with yourself and those
     around you.

   [Mitchell squeezes the baseball and doesn't respond.]

   EXT--P2M-903, PLANET HOSTING BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP, DAY

   [The mothership sits upon a pyramid landing platform. A Stargate is
   nearby, down a short, steep, rocky hill from the mothership. Many Jaffa
   are on patrol and guarding the area.]

   INT--PEL'TAK, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [The Jaffa Commander who was torturing Teal'c enters. Ba'al is standing
   on the bridge looking out the forward view screen.]

     BA'AL
     Speak!

     JAFFA COMMANDER
     It does not seem to be working.

     BA'AL

     (smiling)
     As I feared. His will is strong.

     JAFFA COMMANDER
     I will break him. Whatever it takes.

     BA'AL
     No, no. I'll deal with this.

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c is still restrained to the post, his eyes closed. Ba'al
   enters.]

     BA'AL
     Hello, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C

     (waking)
     You!

     BA'AL
     It seems it's time we had a little chat.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry comes up the stairs and meets Daniel and Bra'tac, who appear
   concerned.]

     LANDRY
     I've recalled Colonel Carter and SG-3 from Chulak. Do we have any
     idea how widespread this brainwashing might be?

     BRA'TAC
     It is impossible to tell. But it explains how many alliances have
     shifted so dramatically over the course of the last three weeks.

     DANIEL
     For all we know, half the High Council may have been compromised.

     LANDRY
     You believe Goa'uld technology is behind this?

     DANIEL
     Teal'c once fell prey to it at the hands of Apophis.

     BRA'TAC
     But he was able to break its hold by enduring the rite of Mal
     Sharran.

     DANIEL
     Anyone, including a Jaffa, could have their hands on that technology
     now.

     BRA'TAC
     Still, the fact that Teal'c overcame such manipulation in the past
     should make him more able to resist its effects again.

     LANDRY
     Which may actually put his life at greater risk.

     DANIEL
     Bra'tac, you said a-- a close friend of yours, Maz'rai, had a
     similar change of opinion, virtually overnight.

     BRA'TAC
     Yes, it is likely he too is brainwashed.

     DANIEL
     Right, I guess what I'm getting at is... is it possible you could
     get him to defeat the brainwashing the same way Teal'c did?

     BRA'TAC

     (realizing the potential importance)
     And if so, at the very least, he might be able to give us an idea as
     to who is behind this.

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Ba'al strolls the room as he speaks to Teal'c.]

     BA'AL
     I admit we've certainly had our differences in the past. But you
     need to hear what I have to say.

     TEAL'C
     I will not hear the words of a false god.

     BA'AL

     (changing to the normal human voice of his host)
     Ah, yes. The whole "god" issue. Maybe we did take it a little too
     far, but can you blame us? We gave you strength, vitality, long
     life. I know you don't quite see it that way, but no matter. It's
     all in the past now.

   [He approaches Teal'c and rests an arm on the metal bar holding
   Teal'c's arms back. Teal'c flinches at the movement, but is angry and
   non-receptive.]

     BA'AL

     (chuckling)
     Oh, come on now, Teal'c. We're smart enough to know we're not
     actually gods! Well, some of us are, anyway. There are always those
     who will begin to believe their own propaganda. I suppose all you
     need is enough people to worship you, and then, what's the
     difference? You're pretty much a god by definition, are you not?
     (becoming serious)
     So is the case with the Ori. Granted they do seem to have some very
     interesting powers to back up their claims. I've seen what happens
     to those who resist. They are a formidable enemy.

     TEAL'C

     (irritated)
     How does this concern you and I?

     BA'AL
     We worked together to defeat the replicators.

     TEAL'C

     (angry)
     This is working together? Taking me against my will? Brainwashing
     the Council to do your bidding?

     BA'AL
     The Jaffa number in the millions spread across the vastness of the
     galaxy. Your backgrounds are diverse and rich in a history of
     warfare with each other.

     TEAL'C
     Because of the Goa'uld!

     BA'AL
     As a united nation, you are young and inexperienced, too weak to
     face an adversary as powerful as the Ori. Gerak proved that. What
     you need right now is a strong leader. One with the mind and
     experience to wage war on such a foe.

     TEAL'C

     (smiling in derision)
     You?

     BA'AL
     I'm not asking you to worship me. I do not plan to undermine your
     freedom. I care nothing for your rites and traditions or what you
     wish to do with your daily lives. What I do not want to see happen
     is the utter subjugation of this entire galaxy at the hands of the
     Ori. That would be an utter shame for all of us. Don't make this
     personal, Teal'c. Your people are in need, and I can help them. I
     can help all of us defend ourselves against the Ori.

   [Teal'c glares at him.]

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   INT--MAZ'RAI'S CHAMBERS, DAKARA

   [Daniel and Bra'tac are visiting Maz'rai.]

     MAZ'RAI
     That is an absurd accusation. You know me, Bra'tac. I choose my
     opinions carefully.

     DANIEL

     That's true. No really, it is.
     (stepping forward, examining a sheaf of papers)
     We checked these out of the Hall of Records before coming here. Six
     months ago you coauthored policy measures designed to prevent voting
     abuses by Gerak's coalition.

   [He hands the policy in question to Maz'rai.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, four months ago you voted in favor of increasing the size of the
     Council to give underrepresented Jaffa a voice.

   [He hands another paper to Maz'rai.]

     DANIEL

     (handing a third sheet over)
     And, just three weeks ago you introduced a motion to set limits on
     the Council's legislative power.
     (handing several papers to Maz'rai)
     Are we seeing a pattern here?

   [Maz'rai examines the papers, considering.]

     BRA'TAC
     You believe in democracy, Maz'rai. How else do you explain your
     actions?

     MAZ'RAI
     I do not deny my beliefs. My thinking on the proper timing and
     strategy for implementation is what's changed.

     BRA'TAC
     Two evenings ago, do you remember clearly what you did?

     MAZ'RAI
     Bra'tac, I do not remember what I ate yesterday. That is sad, I
     admit, but proof of nothing other than old age.

     BRA'TAC

     "Age has taken away everything but our wisdom, old friend." Those
     were your words to me, just before you tabled a referendum for
     democracy.
     (growing insistent)
     Tell me one thing that happened the night before last, and I will
     let this rest.

   [Maz'rai snorts then makes several attempts to reply, but is speechless
   as he appears to search his memories and find nothing.]

     MAZ'RAI

     (disturbed)
     Please leave me. I am weary.

   [Bra'tac approaches Maz'rai and places a hand on his shoulder, meeting
   his gaze intently.]

   INT--CORRIDOR NEAR MAZ'RAI'S CHAMBERS, DAKARA

   [Bra'tac leaves Maz'rai's chamber, Daniel following.]

     DANIEL

     (intent, questioning)
     Bra'tac!

     BRA'TAC
     We have reached him. Trust me. Facing the rite of Mal Sharran is
     something one must do with clear mind and conviction. We must give
     him time.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, AFTERNOON

   [Mitchell is napping on the extra hospital bed while Ferguson lies on
   his bed, awake.]

     FERGUSON
     You know what I think you're doing?

     MITCHELL

     (his eyes still closed)
     Sleeping.

     FERGUSON
     I think you're fighting aliens.

     MITCHELL

     (opening his eyes, but feigning sleepy unconcern)
     I think that chunk of metal you've got in your cranium has caused a
     lot of damage.

     FERGUSON
     I know you weren't test flying a plane down in Antarctica. You were
     fighting an alien armada in human-built, alien hybrid fighters. And
     we've got like a whole fleet of them and at least, uh, a couple of
     interstellar battleships.

     MITCHELL

     (not meeting Ferguson's eyes)
     Whatever you say, man.

     FERGUSON
     The info's out there. Now the military, they couldn't build all that
     stuff themselves. They'd have to contract it out. I did some
     consulting for an aeronautics firm called Zephyr when I first went
     on disability. Come on, man. I'm seasoned enough to see through all
     the bogus cover stories they've been blowing around the last couple
     of years. I mean, what really happened to that building in Seattle a
     couple months back? And that, that strange new influenza outbreak
     that swept the globe -- didn't that start in a hospital near here?

     MITCHELL
     Look, Ferguson--

     FERGUSON
     I know, I know. You can't tell me. Doesn't really matter. The point
     is, I know that whatever you're into, it's big. I mean, it's bigger
     than we ever dreamed of even back when we were cadets and we swore
     that, that blood oath that we'd make it into the space program or
     die trying.

   [Mitchell smiles and chuckles at the memory.]

     FERGUSON
     Look, I'm not some crazy conspiracy nut, Cam. I know... you got
     things to do besides sitting here waiting for me to die. Go.

   [Mitchell closes his eyes briefly and doesn't respond.]

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell is trying to buy a cup of coffee from a machine. He pushes
   buttons and looks at the dispenser, but nothing is happening. Doctor
   Kelly sees him struggling and approaches him; she's holding a medical
   chart.]

     DOCTOR KELLY
     I find it helps if you hit it.

     MITCHELL

     (trying to get his money back)
     Oh, that's all right. I probably shouldn't have any more caffeine.

     DOCTOR KELLY
     I got the results back from the CAT scan.

     MITCHELL

     (turning to face her)
     And?

     DOCTOR KELLY
     Well, it pretty much confirmed Mr. Ferguson's own doctor's findings.
     The shrapnel originally lodged itself against an intracranial artery
     and over the course of the next few years formed the aneurism. Given
     its size and relative position, we risk doing more damage if we
     attack it surgically. Even an intervascular approach would likely
     cause a major rupture.

     MITCHELL

     (still hopeful)
     Okay. So, what's the plan?

     DOCTOR KELLY
     Oh, I know you were hoping for better news, Colonel. I'm sorry. I'm
     afraid there are no options. It's only a matter of time.

   [Mitchell looks at her and becomes more distressed as he soaks in her
   news. He suddenly thrusts his arm backward, shoving his elbow into the
   front of the coffee machine and breaking the glass.]

     MITCHELL

     (intensely)
     Sorry, Doc. You were wrong. Hitting it doesn't help.

   [He walks away briskly as others look on in curiosity.]

     MITCHELL

     (calling back to her)
     I'll pay for that.

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   INT--MAZ'RAI'S CHAMBER

   [Maz'rai lies dead on his bed as Bra'tac and another Jaffa look on.
   Daniel is behind them, at Maz'rai's desk.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to Jaffa)
     Thank you. Now, please leave us.

   [The Jaffa leaves. Bra'tac kneels next to the bed.]

     DANIEL
     You think he did this to himself?

   [Bra'tac picks up Maz'rai's dead symbiote from the floor and examines
   it. Daniel approaches.]

     BRA'TAC
     He removed his own symbiote. The rite of Mal Sharran.

     DANIEL
     I don't understand. Why would he do this on his own? I mean, he had
     to know how dangerous it would be.

     BRA'TAC
     Indeed. It requires that you bring yourself to the edge of death in
     order to find your own true spirit, should you fail...

     DANIEL
     He was ashamed that he'd been brainwashed. If he failed to overcome
     it, he didn't want anyone here to save him.

   [He lifts Maz'rai's arm and places it over his chest.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to Maz'rai's body)
     I pushed you to this, old friend.

     DANIEL

     (handing a piece of paper he has just found to Bra'tac)
     Bra'tac.

   [The paper shows the dying scrawl of Maz'rai.]

     BRA'TAC

     (reading it)
     Ka'lel.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell is using a wall-mounted hospital phone. He's standing next to
   the coffee machine he broke earlier. In place of the broken glass is a
   hand-written sign reading "Out of Order. Sorry."]

     LANDRY

     (over phone)
     Bra'tac is tailing Ka'lel. He's hopeful it'll lead to Teal'c's
     whereabouts.

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

     LANDRY
     Colonel Carter is getting together a rescue operation that we can
     implement the moment we get confirmation.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL
     I'll be there.

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

     LANDRY
     Under the circumstances, everyone will understand if you choose to
     stay back on this one.

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL
     I'm sorry, sir. We're talking about Teal'c.

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

     LANDRY
     I understand. How's your friend doing?

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL
     Not so good. On that front, sir. There's something I need to ask
     you.

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c is restrained as before, with his eyes closed. Ba'al enters.]

     BA'AL
     So, have you given some thought to my proposal?

   [Teal'c smiles grimly but does not answer or open his eyes. He appears
   to be having trouble holding his head up.]

     BA'AL
     To be honest, you've looked better, Teal'c. Don't tell me your
     spirit is waning. I know you need Tretonin to live. Give in; don't
     threaten the future of your people because of personal pride.

     TEAL'C

     (struggling to speak, his eyes closed)
     You are frightened. You seek to control the Jaffa because you
     recognize the power of the Ori, and you are helpless to do anything
     about it on your own.

     BA'AL
     I've tried to be nice. I've tried to present reason, convince you in
     a most merciful fashion. But my patience wears thin. Now rest
     assured I will prevail over your precious Council and control the
     Jaffa. Ultimately, it is for their own good. If you keep resisting
     me, I will have no choice but to let you die.

   EXT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY HOSPITAL, DAY

   [Mitchell is sitting on a bench in front of the hospital, reading the
   pamphlet Ferguson had given him. Carter arrives, pulling a large
   hard-sided suitcase on wheels.]

     CARTER
     Cameron.

     MITCHELL
     Sam.

   [She sits down next to him.]

     CARTER
     Bra'tac got us a gate address. Ka'lel led him to a planet with a
     mothership parked on a pyramid. He believes Teal'c's being held
     there.

     MITCHELL
     That's good news.

     CARTER
     We're briefing in an hour.

     MITCHELL
     I'll be there.

     CARTER
     Do you need some help with this?

     MITCHELL
     No, I got it... Does this make me a hypocrite?

     CARTER
     I told my dad.

     MITCHELL
     He was getting a Tok'ra symbiote.

     CARTER
     Pete.

     MITCHELL
     Got shot but a Goa'uld with a laser blaster. That's not really the
     point. I was talking about using that thing. I mean, after what
     happened to me, I was opposed to anyone ever having anything to do
     with that technology. Now I'm going out of my way to make use of it.

     CARTER
     Is showing your friend the truth going to make him feel any better?

     MITCHELL
     He wants to know I'm not going to be burdened with guilt over the
     fact that he died because of me.

     CARTER
     The truth going to change that?

     MITCHELL
     Not for me.

   [Carter nods.]

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY

   [Mitchell enters the room, pulling the suitcase behind him. Ferguson is
   reading in his bed.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey.

     FERGUSON
     Hey. Are you finally getting the hell out of here?

     MITCHELL

     (closing the door to the room)
     Actually, yes.

     FERGUSON
     Good. I might not be here when you get back, though.

     MITCHELL

     (concerned he means he is going to die)
     Don't you quit on me.

     FERGUSON
     No, I just meant that I'm checking out... of the hospital. I'm going
     home. There's nothing more they can do for me here.

   [Mitchell puts the suitcase onto the table between the beds and begins
   to open it.]

     FERGUSON
     What is that?

     MITCHELL
     It's a little something I picked up on another planet.

     FERGUSON

     (laughing)
     That's very good. That's hilarious. You know you never really could
     tell a joke.

   [Mitchell opens the case to reveal a version of the memory recall
   device he had used with the Galarans. It is clearly technology
   unfamiliar on Earth. Ferguson is very intrigued.]

     MITCHELL
     We've made some modification since we got our hands on this, but
     basically, here's how it works.

   [He pulls out the leads that attach to the subject's head.]

     MITCHELL
     Some of my memories from the last year have been downloaded into
     this device. Attach these leads to your head, and you get to
     experience some of the things I've gone through.

     FERGUSON

     (fascinated)
     You're serious.

     MITCHELL
     You wanted to know the truth. I'm going to show it to you.

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c falls to the floor and begins to move weakly. He is no longer
   restrained. Ba'al and his Jaffa Commander look on.]

     BA'AL

     (holding up a vial of Tretonin)
     You can continue to resist me and die. Or you can take the Tretonin
     and save yourself. Join me, and you will save many more.

   [He places the vial on the table.]

     BA'AL
     It's up to you.

   [He leaves the room.]

   INT--ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY

   [Ferguson is wired to the device with the same leads that Mitchell wore
   with the Galarans. He is reliving Mitchell's memories, and the sounds
   of them are heard. He hears various voices, including Mitchell's own,
   experiencing everything from the crash in Antarctica to the battles
   with the Priors. Mitchell suddenly turns off the machine, and Ferguson
   opens his eyes immediately.]

     FERGUSON
     What are you doing? Why'd you stop?

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c is in trouble. There's a rescue op about to leave. I have to
     go.

     FERGUSON

     (understanding, insistent)
     Go save him, for God's sakes!

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I just don't want you to give up, not when there's so many
     possibilities out there.

     FERGUSON
     Just get out of here.

     MITCHELL
     Look, before I go, I have to say something. You may not like it, but
     I'm going to have to live with it no matter what you say or do. I'm
     sorry. I'm doing what I'm doing and you're not because I acted
     rashly. I'm a hothead, and you're suffering because of it.

     FERGUSON
     No, you're doing what you're doing because of who you are.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I'm impatient. I lose control. I'm not particularly fond of
     that side of myself.

     FERGUSON

     (intensely)
     I don't mean that. When you see an opportunity, you take it. The
     kind of things that you and me were asked to do, that you're doing
     now? I mean, you gotta be a little angry, you gotta be out of
     control. I mean, you think too much, you're just going to freeze up.
     My God, you are going to other planets through a freaking wormhole!
     You have to be a little nuts.

     MITCHELL
     I just don't want to screw up again.

     FERGUSON
     Well, you'd better not. This Teal'c, he seems like a pretty decent
     guy, or alien whatever he is.

     MITCHELL
     Jaffa.

     FERGUSON
     Jaffa. Just be yourself, Cam. Trust me, that's pretty damn good.

     MITCHELL

     (moved)
     Thanks.

     FERGUSON
     I would have done it for anyone. You know that. It's part of the
     job.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, it is.

     FERGUSON

     (starting to smile again)
     Can I use this thing a little more?

     MITCHELL

     (showing him buttons on the device)
     Play. Stop.

     FERGUSON
     Rewind?

   [Mitchell laughs and shows him the rewind button.]

     FERGUSON
     Way cool.

   [They shake hands and smile. Mitchell moves to the door.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey. When you get to the part with the flight attendant?

     FERGUSON
     Yeah?

     MITCHELL
     Skip over that. That's private.

     FERGUSON
     I promise nothing.

   [Mitchell leaves as Ferguson activates the device and begins reliving
   more memories.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Carter is addressing Daniel and an assembly of several SG teams,
   including SG-3.]

     CARTER
     At which point, we should receive radio confirmation from Bra'tac
     that the gate on P2M-903 is clear. We can expect intense but limited
     resistance upon approaching the mothership. It will be visible
     roughly half a mile from the gate. Bra'tac should be able to provide
     aerial cover.

   [Mitchell enters, suited up and armed.]

     LANDRY
     Thank you for joining us, Colonel.

     MITCHELL
     Sir.

   [He stands next to Daniel. Carter nods at him, and he nods back.]

     CARTER
     We will secure the gate, proceed to the pyramid, gain access to the
     mothership, and locate and retrieve Teal'c.

     DANIEL
     Keep in mind, all evidence suggests Teal'c's been brainwashed.
     There's no guarantee he's even going to cooperate with this rescue.

     LANDRY
     Teal'c is family. I don't like people screwing with my family.

     MITCHELL
     We're with you, sir.

     LANDRY
     Let's bring him home.

   [Landry steps away as all the personnel ready their weapons.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c is sweating and moaning on the floor as he moves slowing toward
   the Tretonin vial on the table. Grunting with effort, he finally
   reaches it, takes it, and injects himself. He falls back in relief. The
   Jaffa commander immediately approaches him with the brainwashing
   device.]

     JAFFA COMMANDER
     Shall we try again?

   [He activates the device, and Teal'c screams.]

   EXT--P2M-903, PLANET HOSTING BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP, DAY

   [The Stargate activates, and the Jaffa take up defensive positions with
   staff weapons, including a large staff weapon mounted on a platform on
   a hill overlooking the gate.]

     JAFFA
     Al'kesh sha'kel!

   [An Al'kesh fighter begins to strafe the Jaffa. Many are hit, and some
   retreat.]

   INT--AL'KESH

   [Bra'tac is piloting the ship.]

     BRA'TAC

     (into radio)
     Colonel Carter, the gate has been cleared.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     CARTER

     (hearing Bra'tac)
     All right, let's go. Move out. Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

   [All of the teams rush up the ramp and into the wormhole as Landry
   looks on.]

   EXT--P2M-903, PLANET HOSTING BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP, DAY

   [The teams come through the gate exchanging heavy fire. Mitchell takes
   cover behind a rock. Daniel and Carter do the same nearby. A Jaffa
   fires the mounted staff heavily down at them from the hill. Heavy
   firing continues. Bra'tac's Al'kesh moves in for another run and blasts
   several locations. Two Death Gliders appear and begin to pursue the
   Al'kesh, firing on it.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Bra'tac! Watch your back!

   INT--AL'KESH

   [The ship is taking heavy fire and there are signs of damage.]

   EXT--P2M-903, AREA NEAR GATE, DAY

   [Carter and Daniel are firing fiercely, as is Mitchell nearby. Mitchell
   starts to get up, and the SG-3 leader notices.]

     REYNOLDS
     Go, Colonel! Go! Go!

   [Mitchell gets up and runs forward. He takes out a Jaffa hiding in the
   rocks then moves up to a large boulder. He starts running up the hill
   toward the fixed staff emplacement. Carter sees him moving by himself
   out into the open.]

     CARTER
     Mitchell!

   INT--AL'KESH

   [Bra'tac is struggling to keep the damaged ship under control.]

   EXT--P2M-903, DAY

   [The Death Gliders continue firing on the Al'kesh, which is now
   trailing dark smoke. After another hit it spews flame and moves slowly
   over a hill, apparently about to crash. Carter and Daniel see this and
   continue firing. Mitchell makes his way to the top of the hill and is
   about to fire on the mounted staff position. An unarmed Jaffa attacks
   him from behind, knocking him down. Mitchell gets up and begins
   fighting with the Jaffa, who head-butts him and kicks him to the
   ground. Mitchell zats the Jaffa. Then he picks up his rifle and shoots
   the Jaffa who is operating the mounted staff; he blows it and the Jaffa
   up. Mitchell puts his cap on, picks up his Zat, and moves toward the
   mothership.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Cam, wait for backup!

   [Carter and Daniel break their cover and begin running up the hill,
   with other SGC personnel providing covering fire.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [The Jaffa Commander removes the memory device from Teal'c's temple.
   Teal'c stands unrestrained with his eyes open, in a trance-like state.
   Ba'al enters.]

     BA'AL
     I see you're feeling better. Seems your friends have come to rescue
     you; I expected nothing less. Unfortunately, it's too little, too
     late.

   [There is the sound of engines spooling up. Teal'c tilts his head in
   response.]

   EXT--P2M-903, DAY

   [Carter and Daniel continue to fire from their position close to the
   mothership.]

     CARTER
     The mothership's engines are powering up!

     DANIEL
     It's taking off.

   [They move out toward the pyramid.]

   INT--RING ROOM, PYRAMID PLATFORM

   [Mitchell zats the two Jaffa guarding the entrance and runs inside. He
   goes to the ring control panel and tries to activate the rings, but the
   system does not respond.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

     BA'AL
     I'm curious. Are you merely feigning allegiance, waiting for the
     right time to strike at me?

   [Teal'c remains impassive. Ba'al laughs and signals, and two Jaffa drag
   in an injured Bra'tac. He grunts as they set him kneeling in front of
   Teal'c. Teal'c tilts his head but appears unconcerned for his friend.]

   INT--RING ROOM, PYRAMID PLATFORM

   [Mitchell continues to try to get the rings to work. Two more Jaffa
   enter and raise their staff weapons at him.]

     JAFFA
     Shel kree!

   [Mitchell puts his Zat on the ground and slowly turns around to face
   the Jaffa, his hands up.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Ba'al takes a staff weapon from one of the Jaffa guarding Bra'tac and
   tosses it to Teal'c. Ba'al holds some sort of device in his hands.]

     BA'AL
     Kill him!

   [Teal'c aims the weapon at Bra'tac.]

     BRA'TAC

     (pleading)
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c activates the weapon, opening the tip, but goes no further.]

   INT--RING ROOM, PYRAMID PLATFORM

     JAFFA

     (gesturing for Mitchell to come forward)
     Shel nok!

   [Mitchell gestures for clarification but doesn't move. Then he slowly
   steps forward into the ring platform.]

     MITCHELL
     It took you guys long enough.

   [The two Jaffa look at each other, confused.]

     MITCHELL
     Not you guys.

   [The two Jaffa are zatted from behind. Mitchell returns to the control
   panel as Carter and Daniel run in.]

     CARTER
     The rest of the Jaffa guard are retreating back here.

     MITCHELL
     I can't get these damn rings to work.

     CARTER

     (moving to the control panel and taking it apart)
     If we all go, we could be cut off with no way of getting back off
     the ship. You go. We got your back.

     MITCHELL
     You sure about that?

     CARTER
     Am I going to be able to stop you?

     MITCHELL
     I don't think so. I'm in a bad mood today.

   [Mitchell moves into the ring platform as two more Jaffa start firing
   on them from the entrance. All three fire back, and Daniel moves
   forward along the wall, firing with his pistol. Carter activates the
   rings, and Mitchell disappears up into the ship while Daniel and Carter
   continue firing.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Mitchell runs along the corridor, zatting all the Jaffa he sees.]

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, BA'AL'S MOTHERSHIP

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c. You must resist.

     TEAL'C
     Silence, old man. Your words are meaningless.

   [Teal'c diverts his gaze to Ba'al, who is looking at the device on his
   wrist. Mitchell arrives, Zat blazing, hitting two of the Jaffa. Bra'tac
   grabs the staff of the third while Teal'c turns his staff on Ba'al,
   shooting him three times. Teal'c then hits the third Jaffa in the head
   with his staff, taking him out.]

     MITCHELL

     (aiming his Zat at Teal'c)
     I take it this means I don't have to shoot you.

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     You do not.

     MITCHELL
     Good. It sounds like somebody's still driving this rust bucket. We
     should get the hell out of here before they jump to hyperspace.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c and Mitchell help Bra'tac up and support him as they leave.
   Ba'al is dead, the mysterious device still on his wrist.]

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   INT--OUTSIDE THE JAFFA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS

   [Daniel and Carter are seated on separate benches amidst large columns.
   Daniel is bouncing a tennis ball against the column in front of him,
   catching it and throwing it repeatedly.]

     CARTER
     Would you please stop?

   [Daniel catches the ball and stops, then looks at her.]

     CARTER
     It's kinda making me nervous.

     DANIEL
     Ah, sorry. It's just the implications of this referendum are
     tremendous. We take democracy for granted, but these Jaffa, they--

   [They are interrupted as Teal'c, Bra'tac, and others exit the council
   chamber. They are smiling, shaking hands, and patting each other on the
   back.]

     BRA'TAC
     The referendum passed. For the first time in our history, we will
     have leaders voted upon by every free Jaffa.

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     Congratulations. Welcome to the club.

     BRA'TAC
     Two months from now, we hold general elections.

     CARTER
     Well, let the campaigning begin.

     DANIEL
     What about those Jaffa affected by Ba'al's brainwashing?

     BRA'TAC
     It will take much dedication on their part to overcome, but with our
     help, they shall prevail.

     TEAL'C
     Where is Colonel Mitchell?

   [Daniel and Carter look concerned but don't answer.]

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [Mitchell is sitting on a bench looking soberly at the 'dying'
   pamphlet. Teal'c enters and notices him, then walks toward him.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell. You should know that your actions were
     instrumental in bringing about a successful vote for a democratic
     Jaffa nation today.

     MITCHELL

     (not looking up)
     Yeah, I heard about that. That's great. Sorry I missed it.

     TEAL'C
     I understand. And I am sorry about your friend.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I was hoping to see him again.

     TEAL'C
     I am in your debt, Colonel Mitchell. Not only for saving my life,
     but for saving the life of Bra'tac as well.

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c, no offense, but I would have done the same for anyone. You
     don't owe me a thing. We watch each others' backs 'cause that's our
     job, right?

     TEAL'C

     (bowing slightly)
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c walks away quietly.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, Teal'c.

   [Teal'c turns and comes back.]

     MITCHELL
     How'd you resist the brainwashing? I figure I might be in that
     situation some day, and I don't reckon I'm going through the rite of
     Mal Sharran.

     TEAL'C
     To resist the influence of others, knowledge of one's self is most
     important.

     MITCHELL
     Right. Thanks.

   [Teal'c leaves.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah. I'm working on it.

   FADE OUT
