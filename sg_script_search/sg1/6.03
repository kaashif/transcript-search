VOICEOVER
Previously, on Stargate SG-1.
Scenes from "Revelations"
[A Goa'uld mothership is orbiting an unknown planet. Suddenly, an
Asgard ship appears from hyperspace.]
HEIMDALL
(to O'Neill)
First we must rescue Thor. He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.
ANUBIS
(to an imprisoned Thor)
I am Anubis. This device will be implanted into your brain.
[Anubis switches on a little spiked metal ball.]
ANUBIS
(to an imprisoned Thor)
It will form a link between your mind and the ship's computer. Your
knowledge will simply be downloaded into our memory banks.
[O'Neill and Teal'c are held in a cell.]
THOR
(over speakers)
O'Neill...
O'NEILL
Thor?
THOR
(over speakers)
I am using the internal communication system to synthesize my voice.
I believe I may be able to rewrite some minor subroutines in the
security protocol.
[The door to O'Neill and Teal'c's cell opens. The next scene shows
Heimdall at some controls as O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c ring into the
room. Thor, still encased in a biobed, also appears.]
JAFFA
Lord Anubis, the Asgard prisoner is gone.
ANUBIS
He will not get far.
THOR
(to O'Neill and Heimdall)
You can not take me with you.
O'NEILL
Why not?
THOR
The link between myself and the Goa'uld ship has not been severed.
CARTER
(at an SGC briefing)
They managed to remove the device from his brain, but it may have
been too late. Apparently, he's lapsed into a coma.
END FLASHBACKS
EXT--SPACE
[A small cargo ship is flying through space.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Jacob is at the controls, with Carter in the co-pilot's seat and
Teal'c and Jonas standing behind them. Two other personnel can be seen
at the very rear.]
JACOB
Looks like your analysis was right, Sam. It's dead in space, but
completely intact.
CARTER
Has Anubis ever done anything like this before?
JACOB
This is a first. It must have been a little crazy around the SGC
when it showed up, huh?
[Jacob grins.]
CARTER
You have no idea!
JACOB
I have a pretty good idea, Sam. I used to be an Air Force General,
remember?
[O'Neill appears from the rear, stretching.]
O'NEILL
Are we there yet?
[Teal'c and Carter look back at O'Neill at he stretches.]
O'NEILL
Sorry.
CARTER
Not yet, Sir. Just close enough to do some scans.
O'NEILL
Scanned anything yet?
CARTER
Nothing, Sir.
O'NEILL
Nothing?
CARTER
It's in a stable planetary orbit. Shields and weapons are down, and
it's emitting no EM of any kind.
O'NEILL
Still just, kind of, sitting there.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
[As O'Neill looks puzzled and bored, Jonas smiles, a look of wonder on
his face.]
JACOB
Well, if they were gonna attack Earth, they would have done it by
now.
O'NEILL
(to Jonas)
What are you smiling at?
JONAS
Well, it's just that it's my first time. In space.
O'NEILL
Ah...
JONAS
We'd only begun to consider the possibility of space travel. To
actually be out here is...It's amazing.
[O'Neill looks unimpressed as Teal'c smiles.]
TEAL'C
Indeed.
O'NEILL
Until something goes...horribly wrong.
[Major Davis and Doctor Friesen walk up to the team.]
DAVIS
What's our status?
CARTER
The ship should be just a few hundred kilometers dead ahead. There.
O'NEILL
Ship Ahoy-hoy...
[The cargo ship comes to a stop ahead of a large Goa'uld mothership.
Jonas looks out of the window, smiling and awed.]
JONAS
That's incredible!
CARTER
I'm not a hundred percent but...this could be the same ship Anubis
used to kidnap Thor.
JACOB
Now we know why they haven't attacked. There's no discernible life
signs.
CARTER
All the escape pods have been jettisoned.
TEAL'C
This ship does not appear to have been damaged in battle.
JACOB
Power and life supports are functioning normally. There's just
nobody on board.
JONAS
Why would they abandon a perfectly good ship?
JACOB
They wouldn't.
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership and the smaller cargo ship are in Earth's orbit.]
JACOB
Jack. Rather than fly into a cargo bay, I recommend we use the
transport rings to get us there until we get a better idea of what's
going on.
O'NEILL
(to Jacob)
Yeah.
[O'Neill turns to Davis and Friesen and indicates that they should
leave the cockpit.]
O'NEILL
Boys...
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Radio Hammond. Let him know we'll have something in a couple of
hours.
TEAL'C
Very well.
[O'Neill starts to leave.]
O'NEILL
Jonas, stay with Teal'c.
JONAS
I don't understand.
[O'Neill turns around and walks towards Jonas.]
O'NEILL
I'm sorry. Stay here.
JONAS
So I'm not going with you?
O'NEILL
Not this time.
JONAS
Colonel, I've studied every report, every specification, everything
you have on Goa'uld motherships...
O'NEILL
Because I gave you an order, Jonas. I always have a reason I'm not
required to explain. It's a military thing.
[Jonas watches as O'Neill walks towards the others, who are preparing
to leave the ship.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Jacob, Carter, Davis and Friesen ring into the corridor. They
walk through a doorway. Jacob whispers to O'Neill as he indicates a
direction.]
JACOB
Jack!
[As they follow Jacob, a garbled computerised sound is heard over the
intercom.]
DAVIS
What is that?
JACOB
I can't make it out.
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Jonas sits in the co-pilot seat as Teal'c, sitting in the pilot's
seat, checks the instruments.]
TEAL'C
The crew appears to have abandoned ship, GeneralHammond.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
That's good news! I don't mind telling you, we've all been holding
our breath down here.
INT--CARGO SHIP
TEAL'C
That is most unwise.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and smile.]
HAMMOND
Yes, of course, Teal'c.
INT--CARGO SHIP
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill is leading a team to determine if the vessel can be
salvaged.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
Very well. Keep me apprised. Hammond out.
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Jonas smiles goofily at Teal'c, who gives him a sidelong look.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob leads the others into Anubis' throne-room, where Thor had been
held captive. Jacob activates a control panel.]
JACOB
Well, this is strange. The ship is operational, but before they
left, they initiated a self destruct sequence.
CARTER
It looks like the countdown's stuck.
JACOB
It just doesn't make any sense. The only way to stop a self destruct
is with a command override, but that would completely erase the
sequence, not suspend it halfway.
FRIESEN
So, is the ship gonna explode or not?
JACOB
Well, until we know why the countdown was suspended, we can't be
sure it won't start up again. We need to get to the computer core
and do a diagnostic.
O'NEILL
Carter. You and Davis. See if you can disable that self destruct
altogether.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
DAVIS
Sir.
[Carter and Davis leave as O'Neill sits on Anubis' throne.]
JACOB
Jack, are you seriously considering salvaging this ship?
O'NEILL
Why, yes, I am, Jacob.
JACOB
This ship belonged to Anubis.
O'NEILL
Excellent!
JACOB
What if it's some sort of Trojan Horse?
O'NEILL
Well, then, apparently, they did it wrong.
JACOB
Look, Jack. None of this makes any sense, so before you go slapping
a US Air Force sticker on the side of this ship...
O'NEILL
Oh, will you stop? Obviously we gotta check things out around here,
to see what happened before we do anything.
JACOB
And find out what the hell it's doing in Earth orbit.
O'NEILL
But our standing orders are to recover technology that can help us
defend against the Goa'uld. I'd say this ship falls under that
heading , wouldn't you?
JACOB
Okay.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
JACOB
You know, sometimes I get a little concerned that you're gonna get
my favorite planet wiped out.
O'NEILL
Yes. What planet is that?
[Jacob looks unimpressed at O'Neill's sarcasm. O'Neill grimaces.]
JACOB
So listen, if they wanted to scuttle this ship, and the
self-destruct didn't work, their next logical option would be to
sabotage the hyperdrive.
O'NEILL
Friesen. Let's go.
[O'Neill rises and heads out of the room.]
JACOB
I'll do a system's check from here.
[As O'Neill and Friesen leave, the garbled computerized voice is heard
again over the intercom.]
O'NEILL
Find out what that sound is.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[Carter and Davis head down the corridor until they reach a doorway.
Carter enters a code on the pad to the side of the door, which does not
open.]
DAVIS
What's the problem?
[Carter shakes her head, and enters the code again. Again, the door
stays closed.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, this is Sam.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
What's up?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
CARTER
We're on our way to the computer core, but we can't access this
corridor.
JACOB
(Over radio)
All right, hang on.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob brings up an image of the ship's schematics.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
The whole section's been sealed off, and the life support's been
shut down.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
CARTER
(Into radio)
Why would they do that?
JACOB
(Over radio)
I have no idea.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
I'll see if I can open it up and get the ventilation going again.
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Friesen are walking down the corridor, Friesen checking
papers attached to a clipboard.]
FRIESEN
Colonel, we should also check on the shield generators. O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
How's the hyperdrive?
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Well, Friesen says the engine checks out, but he wants to have a
look at the shield generators.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Did he say why?
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill looks at Friesen questioningly.]
FRIESEN
Why? To see them.
O'NEILL
To see them?
(Into radio)
Never mind.
FRIESEN
If this was the ship that destroyed an Asgard ship, and kidnapped
Thor, then its shields were clearly superior to any...
[O'Neill walks away as Friesen talks.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[As Carter and Davis stand at the doorway, the door suddenly opens.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
We're in!
JACOB
(Over radio)
All right, just be careful, Sam.
[Carter and Davis enter the next corridor.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Yes, Dad.
[The next closed door has a number of weapons fire burns.]
DAVIS
Whoa!
[Davis walks up to investigate the damage.]
DAVIS
Something bad definitely happened here!
[Carter nods agreement as Davis enters a code on the door panel. The
door remains closed.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, we're just outside the computer core. The door looks like it's
been hit by several staff blasts.
JACOB
(over radio)
That's interesting, because it's the only door I can't open.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob is again checking the ship schematics.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
The circuits are fused. It's almost as if there was a deliberate
overload.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
CARTER
(Into radio)
It's starting to look more and more like a saboteur on board.
Someone damaged the computer, and then sealed it off so they
couldn't effect repairs.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Whatever happened...I can't get you inside.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
CARTER
(Into radio)
Colonel? Have you been monitoring?
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Affirmative. On my way.
[O'Neill stops and turns to Friesen.]
O'NEILL
I have to go blow something up. Head on back to the pel'tac, see if
Jacob needs any help.
[O'Neill heads down one corridor, Friesen goes in a different
direction. Friesen then turns back, checks that O'Neill is nowhere to
be seen and heads in the original direction that the two had been
travelling.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill attaches a C4 charge to the door as Carter and Davis look on.]
O'NEILL
Shall we?
[The three take cover as O'Neill detonates the charge.]
DAVIS
WOO! That was loud!
O'NEILL
(loudly)
What?
[The explosion has destroyed the door, and Carter, Davis and O'Neill
step through.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob, we're in.
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
[Carter activates a mechanism which opens a cover, to reveal a
futuristic machine. Davis looks at the machine.]
DAVIS
This is fantastic!
[O'Neill walks over to a bank of viewscreens.]
O'NEILL
No, this is fantastic.
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[Friesen is walking down the corridor, reading the papers on his
clipboard.]
FRIESEN
Shield generators...
[He turns into a room, glowing with green light. He hears a footstep.]
FRIESEN
Hello?
[He walks toward the sound, there is also a blue light effect coming
from the same direction.]
FRIESEN
Colonel O'Neill?
[As he turns towards one of the corridors, he is faced with three Ninja
Jaffa. The lead Jaffa brandishes a sword, while the other two are armed
with staff weapons.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c and Jonas are in the cargo ship, Jonas slumped in his seat,
looking bored. He removes a banana from his pocket. Teal'c looks across
at Jonas as he begins peeling the banana.]
JONAS
Why would he bring me all the way out here, if I'm not gonna be
allowed to contribute anything?
TEAL'C
This is your first mission. It may take some time for Colonel
O'Neill to gain confidence in your abilities.
JONAS
So it was the same for you?
TEAL'C
No, it was not.
[Jonas looks across at Teal'c, surprised.]
JONAS
Oh. You know I heard a rumor that uhh...I only got this assignment
because Colonel O'Neill didn't want to have a Russian on the team.
TEAL'C
Such rumors are meaningless.
[Jonas takes a bite of the banana.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill would not have chosen you if he did not believe that one day
you would be an effective member of SG-1.
JONAS
Thanks, Teal'c! I really appreciate that.
[Teal'c stares out of the viewscreen.]
JONAS
I mean, those of us who are not originally from the planet
Earth...gotta stick together, right?
[Teal'c turns quickly to face Jonas, a forbidding look on his face.]
TEAL'C
Are you suggesting an alien conspiracy?
[Jonas, still eating the banana, shrugs, surprised.]
JONAS
No!
[Teal'c continues to stare at Jonas.]
JONAS
Oho...
[Jonas laughs nervously.]
JONAS
Of course, yes. I...I was warned about your occasional use of humor.
It's...
[Jonas laughs.]
JONAS
Got me!
[Teal'c is still staring at Jonas, unsmiling. Jonas looks across,
notices Teal'c's seriousness, and stops smiling.]
JONAS
No conspiracy!
[Teal'c turns away from Jonas.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
[Carter is kneeling on the floor, working on a laptop computer.]
CARTER
The computer log confirms that this is the same ship that Thor was
aboard.
[Davis is working on the computer core as O'Neill stands apart, looking
on.]
O'NEILL
And?
CARTER
Well, it could explain a lot, Sir. Thor's brain was directly linked
to this computer. Anubis may have grossly underestimated the power
of an Asgard's mind.
O'NEILL
And?
CARTER
It's possible that when his mind was linked, Thor was able to
rewrite some of the ship's programming. Maybe even leave something
behind.
[Davis looks up.]
DAVIS
Like a virus?
CARTER
Exactly. By interfering with everything from navigation to life
support, a complex virus could have driven Anubis to abandon ship.
O'NEILL
Might explain why the self-destruct got stuck.
CARTER
He could have generated a whole new subroutine that sent the ship to
our Solar System after it was abandoned. Like a...a gift! I know it
sounds a little wacky, Sir, but the more I think about it, the more
it seems like the most reasonable explanation.
DAVIS
There's a little wishful thinking there, Major.
CARTER
Well, if this ship wasn't ultimately intended for us to find, why
did it travel half way across the galaxy all by itself? For that
matter, why didn't the self destruct just go off?
DAVIS
Well, even if you're right, I mean, I really doubt that a virus is
gonna know the difference between us and the Goa'uld.
CARTER
There has to be a way to disable it somehow or Thor wouldn't have
sent the ship here.
(Into radio)
Dr. Friesen, this is Major Carter. We could use your assistance in
the computer core.
[Getting no answer, O'Neill rolls his eyes.]
O'NEILL
Friesen, come in!
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, have you seen Doctor Friesen?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Negative.
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
[O'Neill grimaces and smiles at Carter.]
O'NEILL
You scientists. Stay here, I'll find him.
CARTER
It's a big ship, Sir.
[O'Neill heads for the doorway.]
O'NEILL
I think I know where he went.
[Both Davis and Carter kneel next to the computer core. As the garbled
computerised voice again comes over the intercom, Davis stands and
looks around.]
DAVIS
It's coming out of the ship's intercom.
[Carter looks puzzled.]
CARTER
What is?
DAVIS
The sound we keep hearing. You hear that? It's a...there's...there's
a pattern to it, almost like distorted words.
CARTER
Let's check it out.
[Davis again joins Carter at the computer core.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[As O'Neill walks towards the room housing the shield generators, he
slows down and checks the adjoining corridor. As he turns the corner
into the room, he sees Friesen's body on the floor. He checks Friesen's
pulse.]
O'NEILL
(Quietly into radio)
Carter. I want you and Davis back in the pel'tak with Jacob.
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
CARTER
(Into radio)
What's going on, Sir?
INT--MOTHERSHIP GENERATOR ROOM
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Friesen's dead.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob hears O'Neill's transmission.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
[Carter and Davis look at each other, then arm themselves and slowly
stand. They make their way out of the room.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP GENERATOR ROOM
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob, come in.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[A staff blast suddenly hits Jacob in the back, and he topples to the
ground, unconscious. Two of the Ninja Jaffa are standing in the
doorway, one having just shot Jacob. They make their way to the control
panel.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP GENERATOR ROOM
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob, do you read?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[One of the Jaffa works at the control panel, and appears to activate
something. The leave the room, with Jacob still lying unconscious on
the floor.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP GENERATOR ROOM
O'NEILL
(Over radio)
Jacob, come in. Jacob?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill carefully walks along the corridor, checking around corners.
As he turns down another corridor, he runs into Carter and Davis.
Carter has her gun raised towards him, but lowers it as she sees that
it's O'Neill. O'Neill motions for Carter and Davis to follow him along
the corridor.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter and Davis enter, immediately seeing Jacob lying on the
floor. O'Neill motions Carter towards Jacob.]
CARTER
Dad!
[Carter and Davis go to Jacob while O'Neill checks out the rest of the
room. Carter helps Jacob to his feet, while Davis stands, noticing
something out of the viewscreen. He moves to the control panel.]
DAVIS
Colonel, we've got another problem.
[Jacob is standing, though obviously in pain. He waves Carter away.]
JACOB
I'll live. Go, go, go.
[Carter joins Davis at the control panel.]
CARTER
We're decelerating out of orbit and they've disabled the drive
controls. Sir, we've got no way of altering course. We're going to
crash.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Teal'c, come in.
INT--CARGO SHIP
TEAL'C
(Into radio)
O'Neill, you are approaching Earth's atmosphere.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Yeah, you know, we noticed that! You're gonna haveta ring us outta
here.
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c nods at Jonas.]
TEAL'C
(Into radio)
Standing by.
[Both Teal'c and Jonas rise and head to the ring room. As Jonas gets
there, the rings are activated. He turns his back on the rings, but
turns round in time to see the three Ninja Jaffa who have ringed onto
the ship. He gasps and is grabbed from behind by Teal'c, who pulls him
behind a wall. The Jaffa shoot the ring control panel. Teal'c zats one
of the Jaffa and moves to the opposite side of the doorway. He zats
another Jaffa but the third leader makes it to the doorway. Teal'c
grabs the staff weapon from him, hits him with the zat then fires the
zat. Jonas appears in the doorway and activates his zat. Teal'c
collects the staff weapons dropped by the Jaffa. Jonas lowers his
weapon and sighs.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
It's no use. I estimate impact between five hundred and a thousand
miles west south west of Alaska.
DAVIS
The amount of energy released at impact would be massive. There
could be a tidal wave.
JACOB
Raise the shields, set inertial dampening to maximum. That way the
ship should survive in one piece.
CARTER
Done. That's all I can do.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Teal'c, we're heading into the ring room.
[O'Neill heads for the doorway as Carter helps Jacob.]
O'NEILL
Wait, wait, wait.
[O'Neill gestures for the others to stop.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Teal'c?
INT--CARGO SHIP
TEAL'C
(Into radio)
O'Neill, we have been attacked by Jaffa from the mothership.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob, held up by Carter, Carter and O'Neill grimace.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
What's your situation?
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c looks back to Jonas who is standing in the ring room doorway.]
TEAL'C
They are no longer a threat to us, but the ship has been damaged.
[The ring room control panel is damaged and smoking.]
TEAL'C
The crystals that allow us to receive ring transmissions have been
destroyed and there is insufficient time to dock aboard the
mothership.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter, Davis and Jacob turn to the viewscreen, where the
planet is obviously nearing.]
O'NEILL
Well, I guess we're going in.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM--NIGHTTIME
[A monitor shows the mothership's course into the ocean.]
HAMMOND
The official line is that early this morning,
(He's on the phone)
at approximately 0800 hours, NORAD tracked a meteor as it entered
the Earth's atmosphere, and landed somewhere in the North Pacific.
[Hammond is talking on the phone. The Briefing Room is full of
computers and personnel. Walter Davis is manning one of the computers.]
HAMMOND
So far, no word from the Chinese government, but I'm sure we'll be
hearing from them soon enough.
[Teal'c and Jonas enter. Hammond acknowledges them with a nod.]
HAMMOND
As for the Russians, I have a call going through to Colonel Chekov
in about 10 minutes...Yes, Sir. I'll be keeping you apprised of any
further developments.
[Hammond hangs up the phone and turns to Teal'c and Jonas. Teal'c has
walked over to a large-screen display of the mothership.]
HAMMOND
Gentlemen! It's good to have you back. We've located the mothership.
Sonar readings suggest that it's still intact.
JONAS
Then they may still be alive.
HAMMOND
We're proceeding under that assumption.
[Hammond hands a report to Jonas.]
HAMMOND
There's a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle on route from Pearl
Harbor. But we still have to figure out how the crew's going to
access the mothership.
TEAL'C
A mothership's escape pods are jettisoned through pressurized tubes.
It may be possible that one of them could be used as a point of
access.
HAMMOND
That sounds like our best shot.
JONAS
General, with your permission, Teal'c and I would like to join the
rescue operation.
HAMMOND
There's a plane waiting.
JONAS
Thank you, Sir.
[Teal'c nods at Hammond as he and Jonas leave.]
EXT--A ROAD--NIGHTTIME
[Two army vehicles are driving down the road. Teal'c and Jonas are in
one of them, with Teal'c driving.]
JONAS
I should have been with them.
TEAL'C
Do you believe you could have prevented this from happening?
JONAS
Maybe. You don't think so?
TEAL'C
It was an ambush. I believe your presence would have made little
difference.
JONAS
Like on the Cargo Ship?
TEAL'C
You could not have known those Jaffa would ring aboard ship.
JONAS
Yeah. I stood there! You saved my life like Dr. Jackson did back on
my planet. I didn't do a thing!
[Teal'c looks at Jonas, eyebrow raised. Jonas sighs.]
TEAL'C
It is my understanding that it was largely your idea that lead to
the successful disposal of the other Stargate before it could be
detonated.
[Teal'c looks across at Jonas.]
TEAL'C
You saved the lives of millions.
JONAS
Yeah, that was different. That was an intellectual exercise. I'm
talking about knowing what you can do in the heat of the moment when
there is no time to think.
TEAL'C
One can never be certain until the opportunity presents itself.
JONAS
So far, my track record is not great.
TEAL'C
Perhaps that is so.
[Teal'c again look across at Jonas.]
TEAL'C
But there are many battles left to be fought, JonasQuinn.
[Jonas looks at Teal'c, who nods. Both turn to the front.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill and Jacob are sitting on the steps leading to the throne.
Jacob is cradling his left arm close to his body.]
O'NEILL
How are you doing?
JACOB
Aside from the burns, I got a broken collarbone. Selmak's working on
it.
O'NEILL
You know, for guys with no life signs, those Jaffa did a bit of
damage.
JACOB
They must have been trapped in the section of the ship that was
sealed off. To stay alive as long as possible, they would have gone
into a deep state of Kel-no-reem,slowing down their heartrate to one
or two beats per minute. In that condition, the cargo ship's senses
weren't sensitive enough to pick them up.
O'NEILL
Think there are any more running around?
JACOB
I doubt it. My guess is the three that attacked me were on the
computer core level. I let them out when I opened the door to allow
Sam inside.
[Carter and Davis enter the control room.]
CARTER
Well, we've got life support operating at fifty percent. It won't be
too comfortable in here, but at least we won't freeze to
death...right away.
JACOB
Can we fix the engines?
DAVIS
Not a chance, and that's not our only problem.
CARTER
We found evidence of structural damage on the lower levels. Probably
a result of the impact.
JACOB
How bad?
CARTER
I'm not sure. The exterior pressure's pretty severe, especially on
the lower levels of this ship. It wouldn't take much to compromise
the hull.
O'NEILL
Well, help'll be on the way.
CARTER
There's also the matter of the self-destruct sequence frozen half
way through its countdown.
O'NEILL
You haven't turned that off yet?
CARTER
No, Sir. And I'm not sure we should even try.
O'NEILL
Why?
CARTER
Well, first the door to the computer core was locked, and then when
the Jaffa tried to blast their way in, the entire section was sealed
off and life support was shut down.
JACOB
By who? O'NEILL
It's whom.
CARTER
Actually, Sir, it's more like what.
O'NEILL
What?
DAVIS
The virus Thor left behind.
CARTER
Exactly. What if it was trying to defend itself?
JACOB
So Thor leaves behind a virus that forces Anubis to abandon his
ship, and then this virus defends itself against the Jaffa Anubis
left behind to blow this ship?
CARTER
Or...maybe it was left here so we could find it. Sir, with your
permission, I'd like to return to the computer core.
O'NEILL
I'll go with you.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Walter Davis and Siler at sitting at monitors, Hammond is standing
with a Naval officer, looking over plans.]
WALTER DAVIS
Sir, we've just got word from the task force. The DSRV's in the
water.
[An underwater picture of the DSRV is shown.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Carter walk around a corner as the garbled computerised
noise again comes over the intercom.]
CARTER
Major Davis is right. It is definitely coming through the ship's
intercom. Maybe the virus is trying to talk to us.
[They arrive at a closed door. A small puddle of water has trickled
from underneath the door. O'Neill walks up to the puddle and steps in
it.] O'NEILL
What the hey?</blockquote>
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, we've got evidence of flooding here.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
Stand by.
[Jacob tries to rise from the steps, holding his left shoulder. Davis
helps him to his feet. They both make their way to the control panel.
Jacob brings up the ship's schematic on the viewscreen.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
There's been a hull breach on the engineering level.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill looks at Carter, puzzled.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
We're nowhere near engineering.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
It looks like seawater penetrated into the central access shaft, and
now the pressure's pushing it up through the core of the ship. We're
flooding from the inside.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[Both O'Neill and Carter look concerned. Suddenly, the door behind them
begins to close.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, the door's closing behind us
[Carter heads for the door control panel. She enters a code but the
door remains closed.]
JACOB
(Over radio)
It's a security measure. All doors are sealed around the breach.
I'll try to open it from here.
[The water level in the room rises quickly to ankle height.]
O'NEILL
It's a bit chilly.
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, how's it coming with that door?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
This could take some time, Sam.
EXT--OCEAN
[The DSRV comes into view.]
VOICE
We have visual contact.
[The DSRV approaches a large, shadowy shape.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[Carter is still entering codes into the door's control panel.]
CARTER
I'm sorry, Sir. I can't bypass the system locally.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Yeah, without the proper codes, I can't get access to the security
program.
DAVIS
I'm going down there.
JACOB
To do what? The local controls are locked out.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[The water is now up to waist level.]
JACOB
(Over radio)
Jack, I'm going try to find a back door to the program.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
How long's that gonna take? I'm looking at some major shrinkage
here.
JACOB
(Over radio)
I don't know, this is kind of a unique situation. Give me a few
minutes.
O'NEILL
(To Carter)
How long do you figure it'll take for this thing to fill up?
CARTER
A few more minutes.
O'NEILL
Yep.
EXT--OCEAN
[The DSRV is slowly moving forward.]
VOICE
Approaching point of entry.
[The DSRV attaches itself to the mothership.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[The water is now at chest-height on O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Next time we crash our brand new mothership, what do you say we do
it in the tropics?
[The water is at neck-height for Carter. Both are removing outer
clothing.]
CARTER
Actually, Sir, it wouldn't make a difference. At this depth, all
water is ice cold.
O'NEILL
Shallower water, then...shallower.
CARTER
Yes, Sir. I'll keep that in mind.
O'NEILL
Or we could just not crash at all. It would be nice to keep our nice
new mothership more than a couple of hours.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
DAVIS
Jacob, we could blow the door.
JACOB
No, in such a confined space, the concussion would kill them.
DAVIS
They'll be dead if we don't! We can't leave them in there to drown,
Jacob! We have to do som...
JACOB
What the hell do you think I'm trying to do, Major?!
[Both Jacob and Davis are anxious and upset.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[O'Neill and Carter are floating in the water, their heads in the space
between the water and the ceiling.]
O'NEILL
Your dad's cutting it a little clo...
[The room has filled with water.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob continues to work on the control panel.]
JACOB
I can't do it.
[Davis looks at Jacob, visibly upset, then turns away.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
Sam...
[Jacob's voice breaks.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
I'm sorry.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[O'Neill and Carter are frantically trying to find a way out.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[A piercing noise comes over the intercom.]
DAVIS
What is that, Jacob?
JACOB
Security protocol's been erased.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CLOSED ROOM
[Water comes streaming out of the room under the slowly opening door.
As the water in the room subsides, O'Neill and Carter gasp for air,
coughing. O'Neill gets hold of the back of Carter's shirt to keep her
head out of the water. ]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Jack! Sam! Come in!
INT--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM
TEAL'C
Jacob, this is Teal'c. We are on board the ship.
[Jonas drops down from the DSRV access hatch, followed by a seaman.]
JACOB
Teal'c! Jack and Sam are in trouble. Main computer level.
JONAS
That's two levels down this way.
TEAL'C
(To Seaman)
Remain here.
SEAMAN
Yes, Sir.
[Teal'c and Jonas leave.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP ROOM
[The water level has lowered considerably. Carter is gulping for air.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Dad, this is Sam. We're okay!
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob closes his eyes in relief as Davis smiles, and grabs Jacob's
shoulder.]
DAVIS
Yes!
JACOB
(Into radio)
Thank God! Sam, you really had me worried.
INT--MOTHERSHIP ROOM
O'NEILL
Tell him I take back everything I was thinking when I was
underwater.
CARTER
(Into radio)
Whatever you did, it worked!
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Jacob looks at Davis, puzzled.]
JACOB
(Into radio)
I didn't do anything. The security protocol erased itself.
INT--MOTHERSHIP ROOM
CARTER
(Into radio)
Wait a minute! How is that possible?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
I don't know.
INT--MOTHERSHIP ROOM
O'NEILL
Who cares? Let's go!
[O'Neill and Carter leave the room.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Both Jacob and Davis smile in relief.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Carter, and Teal'c and Jonas arrive in the corridor from
different directions.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
JONAS
You all right?
O'NEILL
Ah, a little wet, a little chilly. Knee gets a little stiff in cold
water, you know?
TEAL'C
We have a rescue submarine docked with the ship.
CARTER
We can't leave yet.
O'NEILL
Yes, we can.
CARTER
No, Sir. Something else is definitely going on here.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond and a naval officer are standing at a table, talking. Walter
Davis walks up to them.]
WALTER DAVIS
Sir...
[Hammond and Walter Davis walk away from the table.]
WALTER DAVIS
We just got a message from the task force. The DSRV pilot reports
they made contact, and SG-1's okay, but...Dr. Friesen's dead.
HAMMOND
Did they get them off the ship?
WALTER DAVIS
Not yet. They're staying aboard for some reason.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
[Davis is working on a laptop computer. The garbled computerized noise
is heard over the intercom. O'Neill and Carter are sitting on the
throne steps, with Jacob and Jonas standing nearby.]
DAVIS
It's definitely a voice. Give me a second, I'll see if I can clean
it up.
JONAS
Why would it be so distorted?
JACOB
Anubis probably tried to shut it off.
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Well, the security program that locked us in that corridor didn't
just shut down by itself.
JACOB
You think this virus Thor left in the ship's computer is acting
intelligently?
CARTER
If that door hadn't have opened, Colonel O'Neill and I would have
drowned.
JONAS
It knows who you are.
DAVIS
I got it!
[The laptop monitor shows a pulse line, as a voice repeats over the
intercom.]
THOR
I am using the internal communication system to synthesize my
voice...
TEAL'C
Thor spoke the same words to O'Neill and I when we were imprisoned
aboard this vessel.
CARTER
Sir, maybe what we've been calling a virus isn't a virus at all.
Maybe it's Thor.
O'NEILL
We got him off this ship months ago.
CARTER
Not before Anubis was able to download his mind into the computer
core. Now, if his consciousness remained intact, he would be an
independent entity operating within the system.
JACOB
His mind took control of the vessel.
O'NEILL
Way to go, Thor!
CARTER
Sir, the Asgard said that Thor was on life support but there was
little chance that he'd come out of it.
O'NEILL
So?
CARTER
So, if we can download his consciousness from the computer, the
Asgard can transfer it into a new cloned body.
JACOB
If that's what you want to do, Sam, you'd better move fast. The
computer core isn't flooded yet, but it's only a matter of time.
DAVIS
Wait a second. If Thor is really in control of this ship, then he is
the only thing keeping the self-destruct on hold. We remove that
consciousness, the countdown will start up again.
CARTER
(To Teal'c)
How much time will we have left when the countdown resumes?
TEAL'C
Approximately seventeen minutes.
CARTER
That gives us plenty of time to get out of here after we've got
Thor.
DAVIS
I know Thor was a friend of yours, but this is a Goa'uld mothership!
If we allow it to blow up, there'll be nothing left to salvage.
JACOB
Jack, this ship us never going to fly again. I'd say having the
Supreme Commander of the Asgard Fleet owe you one is more valuable.
O'NEILL
Yeah...all right! Next mothership, we keep, okay?! Jonas, take Davis
and Jacob back to the Sub, wait for us there.
JONAS
Colonel, I'd like to assist Major Carter...
O'NEILL
Jonas...
JONAS
I'll take them back to the sub.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
INT--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE
[Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c enter the room. Teal'c looks behind him
suspiciously. Carter works on the computer, and another room is seen,
rapidly filling with water. Carter removes a drive from the computer.]
CARTER
Here he is.
[Teal'c raises an eyebrow as O'Neill checks the now empty computer
slot.]
O'NEILL
You sure you got all of him in there? He's a smart guy, you know?
[A Goa'uld computerised voice is heard over the intercom.]
TEAL'C
The self-destruct has been reactivated.
O'NEILL
Let's go.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[They exit the room and head down a corridor. They come to a closed
door.]
TEAL'C
This door should not be closed.
O'NEILL
Dang.
CARTER
The corridor must have flooded.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob?
JACOB
(Over radio)
Yeah, what's going on?
O'NEILL
Our exit is blocked. We need another way around.
JACOB
(Over radio)
Jack! All the other passageways into that section were already
flooded. There is no other way around!
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
Jack, I'm going back to the Pel'Tac see if I can figure something
out.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
Negative. Get that sub to a safe distance, we'll think of something.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Understood.
[Jacob nods to Davis and Jonas. All three head off down the corridor at
a run.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
I got nothing.
(To Carter)
How are you doing?
CARTER
Sir, there's only one other way off this level.
TEAL'C
The glider bays.
[Carter nods in agreement. O'Neill turns from Carter to Teal'c]
O'NEILL
We can do that?
[Carter shakes her head.]
CARTER
I have no idea.
[O'Neill looks from Carter to Teal'c, who does not react.]
O'NEILL
Okay.
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c walk away from the closed door.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM
[Davis, Jonas and Jacob run into the room.]
JONAS
(To seaman)
The ship's self-destruct has been activated. We need to get the DSRV
as far away as possible.
JACOB
(Into radio)
Jack, we're at the sub. What's your status?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c come upon another closed door. Carter puts
the computer drive containing Thor aside.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Here's our plan, Jacob. We're going to take a couple of gliders.
JACOB
(Over radio)
Jack, a glider isn't designed to operate underwater.
CARTER
(Into radio)
It's our only shot.
INT--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM
JACOB
Uh, all right, all right.
[Jacob rubs his forehead, as Jonas stands, listening.]
JACOB
Umm...you'll have to activate the compartment's forcefield to stop
the flooding. Now, those systems went off-line after the crash.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
CARTER
I know. I'm trying to reroute the power from here.
[Carter is working at a panel, removing and replacing crystal modules.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM
JONAS
What is it?
JACOB
Glider bays have forcefields that allow ships to go in and out
without having to depressurize the compartment. If she can't get it
online, she won't be able to open the doors without flooding the
hanger.
JONAS
Right!
JACOB
(Into radio)
Sam?
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob, I want you to get that sub to a minimum safe distance.
INT--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM
JACOB
(Into radio)
Understood.
(To Jonas)
Let's go.
JONAS
There's an auxiliary control panel on this deck. I could reroute the
power from there.
JACOB
How do you know?
JONAS
Cause I've gone over the schematics of these motherships a dozen
times, and I'm a very quick study.
JACOB
Yeah? Well, where is it?
JONAS
Don't wait for me.
[Jonas heads down the corridor at a run.]
JACOB
Right, now...Jonas!
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
[Carter is still rearranging the crystal modules as O'Neill and Teal'c
look on.]
O'NEILL
No pressure, Carter.
[O'Neill pats Carter on the shoulder.]
O'NEILL
Plenty of time.
TEAL'C
On the contrary, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Lots and lots...
[O'Neill glares at Teal'c and makes the cutthroat gesture.]
O'NEILL
...of time!
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
JACOB
(Over radio)
Jack.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Jacob, will you please get out of here?
JACOB
(Over radio)
We are, but Jonas went off to try to get the forcefield online from
a relay panel on this deck. Listen...good luck!
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas runs up to a closed door. He removes his outer vest and jacket.
He enters a code on the control panel of an opened doorway to close the
door and also enters a code on the panel of the already closed door. He
removes his shoes and holds onto the doorframe.]
JONAS
Okay!
[Jonas takes a couple of deep breaths as he punches the final code into
the panel. The door mechanism is heard, and the sound of water.]
INT--OCEAN
[The DSRV detaches from the mothership and turns to leave.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
[Carter looks up from the control panel as the computerized Goa'uld
voice again comes over the intercom.]
O'NEILL
What'd he say?
TEAL'C
We are being advised that in approximately seven minutes, the ship
will be destroyed.
O'NEILL
Ah, see?
[O'Neill again pats Carter's shoulder.]
O'NEILL
Plenty of time.
CARTER
This terminal isn't tied into the primary system. I can't reroute
the power from here.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[The corridor is quickly filling with water. Jonas is holding onto the
doorframe, taking deep breaths. As the water reaches his chin, he dives
underwater. He swims under the opening door to the control panel. He
rearranges some crystal modules, then presses a couple of buttons that
illuminate.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
[The panel that Carter is working on illuminates.]
CARTER
Forcefield just came online.
O'NEILL
Nice!
CARTER
It wasn't me.
TEAL'C
Jonas.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas, still underwater, swims to another control panel and activates
it. He swims away from the walls and floats upright. Suddenly,
transportation rings are activated around him. The rings reappear in an
unflooded section. Jonas drops to the floor, engulfed by water that was
ringed down with him. He gasps for air, then rises.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY
CARTER
Okay
[Carter moves to the door's control panel and punches in a code. The
glider bay door opens. They are about to step through as Jonas comes
running down the corridor towards them.]
JONAS
Wait! Wait! Did it work?
O'NEILL
We're about to find out.
[O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Jonas step into the glider bay.]
EXT--OCEAN
[The DSRV is moving away from the mothership.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP GLIDER BAY
[Teal'c and Carter step into a glider, with Teal'c in the pilot seat.]
TEAL'C
Powering engines.
[O'Neill and Jonas step into another glider, with O'Neill in the pilot
seat. O'Neill powers up the glider.]
O'NEILL
Listen, if we don't survive this...thanks.
JONAS
You're welcome.
INT--TEAL'C AND CARTER'S GLIDER
CARTER
Opening glider bay doors.
[The bay doors open. The forcefield is in place. Both glider hatches
close.]
INT--O'NEILL AND JONAS' GLIDER
O'NEILL
Nice!
[Both gliders take off, though the flight is bumpy.]
O'NEILL
Hang on!
[An explosion occurs behind them, and as the gliders fly out of the
water another, larger, explosion, comes up from the sea.]
O'NEILL
Wo-Ho!
[Carter and Teal'c's glider appears alongside.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Everybody all right?
CARTER
(Over radio)
Yes, Sir. We're fine.
[Carter and Teal'c's glider peels away.]
JACOB
(Over radio)
This is Jacob. We're a little seasick down here, but we're in one
piece, too.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Glad to hear it.
JACOB
(Over radio)
What about Jonas?
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
All members of SG-1 present and accounted for.
[Jonas is looking around, grinning.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Teal'c, take lead.
INT--TEAL'C AND SAM'S GLIDER
[Teal'c salutes, and sharply peels away.]
INT--O'NEILL AND JONAS' GLIDER
[Jonas is still grinning.]
O'NEILL
Are you smiling?
JONAS
First time in a death glider.
O'NEILL
Oh! Well...
[O'Neill does a roll, startling Jonas who grabs at the glider hatch.
Stunned, Jonas shakes away the dizziness as O'Neill smirks. The two
gliders fly into the distance.]
