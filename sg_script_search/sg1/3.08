TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)
[SG-1 step out of the Stargate onto a foreign world. The Stargate
closes behind them.]
O'NEILL
Ah, trees, trees, and more trees. What a wonderfully green universe
we live in, eh? Where's that village?
CARTER
The UAV found it eleven klicks southwest of here.
O'NEILL
Eleven? Oy.
[Teal'c discovers a muddied track.]
TEAL'C
Here. This path is well travelled.
DANIEL
Which means the Stargate is still in use by someone.
O'NEILL
Or...something.
[They head out into the countryside, following the path.]
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[Carter sees a building in the next valley.]
CARTER
The UAV photos were right, there it is. Looks like a church.
O'NEILL
And that would mean what?
TEAL'C
That it is most likely Christians reside here, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Thank you Teal'c.
CARTER
Well, this is the first sign of Christianity we've encountered, Sir,
in hundreds of missions.
DANIEL
Which means they probably had to have been taken from somewhere in
medieval Europe through the Antarctic gate.
TEAL'C
By which Goa'uld?
DANIEL
That's a good question.
[They head down into the valley towards the village.]
DANIEL
(cont'd)
Most Goa'uld that we've encountered that have enslaved ancient human
populations have taken on the roles of those cultures' deities. Ra,
Apophis, Hathor from the Egyptian pantheon...
O'NEILL
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.
DANIEL
Well, if these people were already Christians when they were taken
from Earth, that suggests this Goa'uld is...is playing...
O'NEILL
God? As in God God? It's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
TEAL'C
I know of no Goa'uld capable of showing the necessary compassion or
benevolence that I have read of in your Bible.
O'NEILL
You read the Bible, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
It is a significant part of your Western culture. Have you not read
the Bible O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Oh yeah, yeah, not all of it. Actually, I'm listening to it on tape.
Don't tell me how it ends.
EXT--VILLAGE (DAY)
[SG-1 enters what appears to be a medieval village. When its
inhabitants see SG-1 they run into their houses. Daniel approaches one
house whose door is still open. A woman and her children are looking
out.]
DANIEL
Hello? We're not going to hurt you.
[The woman slams the door in his face.]
DANIEL
We're peaceful travellers.
O'NEILL
They're not buying it, Danny.
[He finds a stone pedestal with the symbol of a cross and writing on
it.]
O'NEILL
Is this English?
[Daniel comes to look.]
DANIEL
Middle English, pre-Chaucer.
(reading from the tablet)
'Myn Jesus, by the sorrows thou suffered in thy passion in ye
garden, thy scourging and thy crowning with thorns, in thy
crucifixion and death show mercy to those who are about to be
delivered unto the devil.' It's a...a derivative of the Catholic
prayer for Suffering Souls.
[O'Neill catches sight of a young woman chained to a post in the middle
of the Village Square.]
END OF TEASER
EXT--VILLAGE (DAY)
[SG-1 hurry over to the woman, who is frightened by their presence.
There are red marks on her face.]
O'NEILL
(to the woman)
It's all right. It's all right. We'll get you out of this in a
minute.
[A man appears from a nearby house, holding a cross before him.]
MAN
Spare her, please!
DANIEL
Oh, we're not going to hurt her. Or you. We're friends. I'm Daniel.
MAN
I am Simon. You have come through the Circle of Darkness?
CARTER
The Stargate? Yes.
SIMON
Then you must be of his brethren. I beg of you, Mary is so young.
She did nothing to warrant Sacrifice.
O'NEILL
Whoa. What sacrifice?
SIMON
If you leave her body, the village Canon may choose another
possessed soul.
DANIEL
You think we're demons.
(to O'Neill)
He...thinks we're demons.
O'NEILL
Uh-huh.
(to Simon)
Well, we're not demons. We're human, like you. From Earth, like you.
DANIEL
(to Simon)
Do other demons come through the Circle?
SIMON
You know he does.
DANIEL
Uh, no, we don't know anything about him, but we'd like to. What
does he look like?
SIMON
Mostly he comes in his true form. But demons can take many shapes.
[He looks over at Teal'c, who is examining the chains holding Mary.]
TEAL'C
Major Carter. Shield her eyes.
[Carter leans over to cover Mary's face. Teal'c shoots the chain with
his staff weapon.]
SIMON
(to Mary)
Go into the house! Quickly!
[Mary runs away into the house. Simon falls to his knees before
O'Neill.]
SIMON
Leave her body, please.
O'NEILL
Come on, get up.
SIMON
Take me in her place!
O'NEILL
Look, stop that, will ya? Come on, up up. Let's go, come on.
[He pulls Simon to his feet.]
O'NEILL
Listen to me. We're not demons. And Mary is not possessed. From the
looks of it, she's a little sick. If you let us, we might be able to
help.
[Simon nods and leads them to his house.]
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (DAY)
[Mary is lying in a bed, Simon sitting at her side, while Carter checks
her temperature.]
O'NEILL
Chickenpox. Trust me.
CARTER
Her fever's pretty high.
O'NEILL
It'll break.
(to Mary)
Those spots will get itchy, but that's about as bad as it'll get.
You'll be fine in a couple of days.
SIMON
That won't be soon enough. The time of Sacrifice is at hand. The
elders will have to perform the trepanning ritual tonight to cleanse
her.
DANIEL
Oh jeez.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
It was a procedure often done in the Middle Ages. They...well they
drill a hole in the person's head. By drilling a hole, the evil
spirits are released, thus saving the person from eternal damnation.
O'NEILL
Thus...saving the person?
DANIEL
Well, they didn't call them the Dark Ages because it was dark.
[They hear the sound of a horn blowing outside. Simon takes his cross
and starts to pray over Mary, who is clearly frightened.]
SIMON
(praying)
My Jesus, by the sorrows you suffered in your agony in the garden...
VILLAGER
(outside)
The demon comes!
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (DAY)
VILLAGER
The demon comes!
[He runs away as an Unas enters the village.]
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (DAY)
O'NEILL
The demon comes?
[SG-1 go over to the windows and look out. O'Neill sees the Unas enter
the Village Square.]
O'NEILL
Damn. Unas?
TEAL'C
You are correct O'Neill. The first host of the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
No, no, no...we killed him, he's dead.
TEAL'C
We only killed one Unas.
O'NEILL
I thought there only was one. Unas, uno...one.
TEAL'C
They are in fact a species.
[The Unas examines the area when Mary was chained. He addresses the
village.]
UNAS
(in a distorted, Goa'uld-like voice)
The time of Sacrifice is at hand. My lord Satan calls for five
wretched souls to reclaim as his.
O'NEILL
Satan?
TEAL'C
Sokar.
CARTER
Gathering host bodies.
UNAS
(outside)
At sunrise shall I return to claim the five. If you have not chosen,
I shall take whom I please in far greater numbers.
DANIEL
I think we were wrong about this Goa'uld. He isn't playing God. He's
playing the devil.
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (DAY)
[Simon rises from Mary's bedside.]
SIMON
The time is at hand.
MARY
No! No, no!
[Simon takes out a package and begins to unwrap it.]
O'NEILL
Simon.
SIMON
Canon will return from his hermitage soon.
O'NEILL
The creature that just sauntered through your village is called an
Unas.
[Simon ignores him and continues to unwrap the package.]
SIMON
The time of Sacrifice has been declared. I feared it would be...
O'NEILL
Simon! Listen to me.
[Simon pauses and climbs to his feet to face O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Look, we've run into this kind of thing before. Now, it's not a
demon. It's demonesque I'll grant you, but it's just a big, ugly
creature.
DANIEL
(quietly, to O'Neill)
Who's inhabited by a Goa'uld that gives it great strength,
intelligence and the ability to regenerate.
O'NEILL
Yes. It's a very smart, resilient creature.
DANIEL
(quietly)
In the service of Sokar, who, for all intents and purposes, is Satan
to these people.
O'NEILL
But it's not a demon.
DANIEL
(to Simon)
No, it's not a demon.
TEAL'C
My friends speak the truth, Simon. This demon is nothing more than a
parasite that inhabits another creature. Your fear is its greatest
power over you.
SIMON
You do not fear it?
TEAL'C
We do not.
[Simon looks over the weapons they carry.]
SIMON
You say you have killed an Unas once before?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
SIMON
Then perhaps God has sent you. Perhaps you are the answer to our
prayers. All my life I have asked God to deliver us from this evil.
O'NEILL
So what did the lizard say? That he'd be back at sunrise?
TEAL'C
Are you contemplating attack O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Yeah, sure, why not.
TEAL'C
An Unas is difficult to destroy.
O'NEILL
Couple of shots with a staff, we own him.
CARTER
We hope. It took Thor's Hammer to kill the last one.
O'NEILL
All right, a whole bunch of shots with a staff. Daniel, how long
have these people been living like this?
DANIEL
Well, I can't be sure without proper reference...
O'NEILL
(cutting him off)
A thousand years?
DANIEL
At least.
O'NEILL
That's long enough. These people are being terrorised. We have the
power to stop it.
TEAL'C
Sokar will seek revenge.
O'NEILL
All right, so we'll have them bury the Gate after we've gone.
DANIEL
They could come in ships.
O'NEILL
Ships?
CARTER
I can't be sure, but the co-ordinates of this planet are years away
from any known Goa'uld homeworld, even with their faster ships.
O'NEILL
Simon? Do you want us to do this?
SIMON
Are we not in God's hands?
[Outside, the church bell is rung.]
SIMON
The Canon has returned.
EXT--VILLAGE (DAY)
[The Canon enters the village, surrounded by guards armed with
pitchforks. He is greeted by the villagers as he enters the square.]
SIMON
(to O'Neill)
The Canon will choose those for Sacrifice tonight.
O'NEILL
Why does he get to choose?
SIMON
He is our spiritual leader. It falls to him to determine those of us
whose souls are already possessed with evil.
[The villagers point out SG-1 to the Canon, who approaches them]
CANON
(to SG-1)
You have come down the path, through the Circle of Darkness?
O'NEILL
Something like that. My name's Jack O'Neill...
CANON
(angrily, to Simon)
And you gave them entrance to your home?
SIMON
Yes, but I do not believe they mean us harm.
CANON
The tricks of Satan and his minions are many. And only those weak of
faith are fooled by such deception. By granting them entrance, you
have spilled the blood of your people!
DANIEL
(to the Canon)
We come as friends, Sir.
[The Canon approaches Teal'c and examines his gold tattoo.]
CANON
This one bears the mark of the devil!
(to SG-1)
If you are human as you say, then your souls are damned...
O'NEILL
(to the Canon)
All right, that's enough. He is not a demon, he is a Jaffa. Satan is
not involved here.
(to the gathered villagers)
That creature that strolled through your village a little while ago?
It's called an Unas. We have the power to stop it. That means no
more Sacrifices. All you have to do is give us a chance to help.
What do you say?
CANON
(to his people)
If they came through the Circle of Darkness, then their souls are
unclean!
TEAL'C
It appears they do not desire our assistance O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Yeah, fine, whatever.
(to the Canon)
Have a nice day.
[He starts to walk away.]
CANON
You shall be struck down!
[The Canon touches his ring, activating it.]
SIMON
No, no Canon.
[Storms clouds gather in the sky and thunder can be heard. Simon
cringes away from the Canon, who presses the centre stone on his ring.
A bolt of lightning comes out of the sky and strikes the ground where
SG-1 are standing. They are all knocked unconscious by the blast. The
Canon looks on, satisfied.]
INT--CELL, VILLAGE (DAY)
[Carter, lying on straw, regains consciousness to see O'Neill chewing
on a grass stalk. Outside, two men can be seen guarding the cell.]
CARTER
Sir, I've been disarmed.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I picked up on that too. Teal'c's gone.
[Carter looks round as Daniel wakes up.]
DANIEL
Did we just get struck by a big bolt of...lightning?
CARTER
That's what it looked like. Felt more like a zat blast to me.
He...touched his ring just before the lightning started.
O'NEILL
Carter, if I ever get the urge to help anybody again, feel free to
give me a swift kick.
[Carter sees Simon approaching. He speaks to the guards, then comes to
speak to O'Neill, who stands up.]
SIMON
I do not believe you are demons. I've said as much to the Canon, but
he refuses to hear me.
O'NEILL
(removing the grass stalk from his mouth)
Where's our friend?
SIMON
It has been decided he must endure the tests.
O'NEILL
What tests?
[They are interrupted by shouts from the villagers.]
VILLAGERS
He is evil! Devil! Burn him! Satan! He is evil! Evil!
[Teal'c is brought into the square by two guards and tied to a post.
His face is bloodied and beaten. The villagers gather to watch the
trial. O'Neill watches from the cell.]
CANON
(to Teal'c)
What have you to say for yourself?
TEAL'C
That I do not serve those whom you would call demon.
CANON
(to the villagers)
There are living among us demons...
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Teal'c.
SIMON
(to O'Neill)
Say nothing more, or they will kill him.
CANON
(cont'd)
For this reason, we are commanded by God to seek out those spirits
and punish them!
[He turns to the blacksmith who is stoking a glowing furnace.]
DANIEL
The mark of the devil.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
Uh, in the Middle Ages one of the proofs of witchcraft was a mark on
the body supposedly made by the devil himself that was insensitive
to pain.
[The blacksmith hands the Canon a glowing metal poker, who places it
against Teal'c's gold tattoo. Teal'c doesn't react, feeling no pain.]
CANON
The first proof is given!
O'NEILL
Daniel?
DANIEL
It's not good.
EXT--LAKE SHORE (DAY)
[SG-1 are led along the shore of a lake, the villagers following.
Teal'c is led out onto a jetty, where a large rock is chained to his
leg.]
CANON
And they went up on the breath of the Earth. And fire came down from
God out of Heaven and devoured them.
DANIEL
The water test.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
Common practice in the Middle Ages. They weighed a person and threw
them in the water. If he sinks, he's innocent.
CARTER
If he floats, he's guilty of witchcraft and burned at the stake.
It's Catch22.
[A black hood is placed over Teal'c's head.]
CANON
Archangel, Saint Michael, defend us in battle. Thrust into hell
Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl upon the Earth. Amen.
[The Canon nods and the guards prepare to push Teal'c into the lake.]
DANIEL
We'll go back where we came from!
CARTER
He's innocent!
O'NEILL
(starting forward)
You sons of bitches!
[One of the guards strikes him across the face, knocking him to his
knees. Teal'c is pushed into the water. Daniel, Carter and O'Neill can
only watch. Bubbles rise from the water, but there's no sign of Teal'c.
The Canon prays quietly, then holds out his hand over the water.]
CANON
God's will...has been done.
[Simon, standing in the crowd, bows his head. The Canon and his guards
walk away.]
INT--CELL, VILLAGE (NIGHT)
[Teal'c's body is lying on an altar, while hooded women pray silently
over him. From their prison cell, O'Neill, Carter and Daniel watch. The
Canon approaches their cell.]
CANON
Your friend's soul is clean. If you wish he'll be given a Christian
burial.
O'NEILL
What?
CANON
You're free to go. I insist only that you remain in chains until
your return through the Circle of Darkness, to whatever dark place
you reside and that you never return.
O'NEILL
Because you know if I did return I would break your damn neck. But
of course you could just touch that lovely ring of yours and we'd
all be struck down again.
CANON
Ah the ring. It has been handed down through generations of village
canons who came before me.
DANIEL
And with it you maintain power.
CANON
With it I abide by God's will, as best I can. Sacrifices must be
made.
DANIEL
Why?
CANON
Do you deny the demon is real? Do you deny that it could destroy us
if it so wished?
[Daniel has no reply to that and looks away.]
CANON
(cont'd)
The Sacrifices allowed the people of this village to survive for
generations. Just as the wheat is separated from the chaff, the
unclean souls among us must be taken away, through the Circle of
Darkness. Forever.
O'NEILL
And you decide.
CANON
Yes I do. Now go thy way. Trouble me no more.
[As he leaves, Simon approaches their cell.]
SIMON
I am sorry.
O'NEILL
You know Simon, your village Canon has an awfully interesting way of
tending the flock.
SIMON
Speak no more of this.
DANIEL
He maintains power by controlling who gets Sacrificed and who
doesn't.
SIMON
No more! I have asked for this dispensation and he has granted it.
[He unlocks their cell. Still in chains, they head over to the altar
where Teal'c lies.]
O'NEILL
(to Simon)
Where's our gear?
SIMON
If I were to bring it to you, would you help us?
O'NEILL
Help you?
CARTER
You can bury the Stargate after we've gone through. That should
prevent the Unas and anything else from...
SIMON
I cannot do that!
DANIEL
Well there must be other people who are willing...
SIMON
I mean the Circle. We are not allowed to go near it, or even look
upon it.
[A villager, holding a lantern, calls to Simon.]
VILLAGER
Simon? We are ready.
SIMON
I shall be there.
DANIEL
Ready? Ready for what?
SIMON
The trepanning ritual. Mary's parents were taken in a Sacrifice a
year ago. They asked that I care for her. If you're not willing to
help, it falls to me to try to cleanse her soul before the Canon
chooses.
DANIEL
You can't do that.
SIMON
I have no choice.
DANIEL
You'll kill her.
SIMON
Better that she die among us than at the hands of the devil himself.
[He leaves.]
DANIEL
Jack.
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
We can't condemn a young girl just because one man has made a pact
with the devil. Teal'c will have died for nothing if nothing good
comes from this.
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (NIGHT)
[Simon enters the house where Mary is still sick, tended by another
villager. Simon crosses himself, then approaches her bedside.]
SIMON
(to Mary)
There shall be a great reward waiting for you in Heaven and the
angels will welcome you with joyful hearts. And there will be no
more pain.
MARY
I know.
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (NIGHT)
DANIEL
Ok, I'll tell you what. You guys start back without me. I'm just
going to go see if I can stop these people from a drilling a hole in
the head of a young girl.
[He heads towards Simon's house. O'Neill glances at Carter, before
following Daniel.]
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (NIGHT)
[Simon unwraps the package once more and takes out a hand drill. The
villager holds Mary's head still as he prepares to use it. Daniel
enters the house.]
DANIEL
Wait!
[Simon lowers the drill.]
DANIEL
We'll take you back with us. Mary too. Where we come from, there are
no demons.
[Simon nods gratefully. O'Neill and Carter enter the house. O'Neill
holds out his hand for the drill and Simon hands it to him.]
O'NEILL
Good choice.
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (NIGHT)
[The hooded women are anointing Teal'c's body in preparation for
burial. A shroud is placed over his face and body and the women kneel
down to pray.]
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (NIGHT)
[Carter is checking Mary's temperature once more.]
CARTER
Fever's down. Feeling any better?
MARY
Yes. Have you released that which possessed me?
CARTER
You got better all by yourself, Mary. There was never a demon inside
you.
[O'Neill lifts his chains.]
O'NEILL
So Simon. You wouldn't happen to have the keys to these would you?
(to the villager)
Keys?
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (NIGHT)
[One of the women praying over Teal'c glances up as he moves, but
resumes praying when none of the other women appear to notice.
Suddenly, Teal'c sits up and the women scream and run away.
[Teal'c opens his eyes and removes the shroud covering his face.]
INT--SIMON'S HOUSE, VILLAGE (NIGHT)
[When they hear the screams, SG-1 head outside, along with Simon.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (NIGHT)
O'NEILL
What's that?
SIMON
I don't know.
[Teal'c comes walking towards them, pulling on his jacket.]
DANIEL
Teal'c. You're--alive.
TEAL'C
It is so.
[O'Neill realises what must have happened.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c's stomach)
Way to go Junior!
[He claps Teal'c on the shoulder.]
TEAL'C
My symbiote did sustain me.
CARTER
Oxygen in the water. It's the larval Goa'uld's natural environment.
It must have filtered the oxygen and fed it into Teal'c. You were
out for a long time Teal'c. I thought we'd lost you.
TEAL'C
When I realised they planned to immerse me, I put myself in a deep
state of Kel'no'reem.
[The villagers have gathered and are looking on.]
O'NEILL
You'd think these folks never saw a guy rise from the dead.
CARTER
(to Simon)
Simon. I know this must look...unusual. But there is actually a very
logical explanation for this.
CANON
Yes there is!
[The Canon enters the square with his guards.]
CANON
There can be no doubt now. They are evil. All of them.
O'NEILL
(to the Canon)
What do you want from us? He passed your test.
CANON
These four shall be the first chosen for Sacrifice.
O'NEILL
Major, next time Daniel gets the urge to help someone, shoot him.
[They are surrounded by the Canon's guards and led away.]
CANON
And with them shall be taken the woman whose soul has been
possessed.
[Two more guards enter Simon's house.]
SIMON
(to the Canon)
Please! Spare her. At least allow me to try the trepanning.
CANON
You challenge my decision?
SIMON
No.
[Mary is dragged from the house by the guards.]
MARY
Simon! Simon, please help me! Simon.
CANON
(to the villagers)
To your homes! Do not let the demon lay his eyes upon you.
[SG-1 and Mary are chained to the posts in the Village Square.]
SIMON
I am sorry Mary.
O'NEILL
Don't apologise to her. Help her!
SIMON
The Canon has spoken.
O'NEILL
What are you, the village idiot?
DANIEL
(to Simon)
The demon will turn her into a host. You know what that means.
Course you don't know what that means.
SIMON
I can hear no more of this.
[He returns to his house.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (DAY)
[As the sun rises, SG-1 are still chained up, waiting for the Unas'
return. Daniel sees Simon lurking in the doorway to his house, watching
them.]
DANIEL
Jack.
O'NEILL
Simon, get out here and do something!
[Simon doesn't move.]
DANIEL
(to O'Neill)
I don't think anything we say is going to make a difference,
especially not after Teal'c's...resurrection.
[A horn is sounded and the Unas enters the Village Square.]
O'NEILL
(to the Unas)
Mornin'.
[The Unas ignores him and starts to unhook their chains from the
posts.]
O'NEILL
(to the Unas)
So...how long you gonna keep this up? The demon bit? Don't get me
wrong, looks like a great gig. You got the padre in your back
pocket, the hours are good, probably get all the chicks...ahh!
[He is cut off as the Unas grabs him by the throat and lifts him into
the air, before letting him drop.]
O'NEILL
(clutching his throat)
Oh my apple!
VILLAGER
(to Simon)
If they truly are servants of Satan, why does he resist?
UNAS
(to O'Neill)
You are not of this world.
O'NEILL
(lying on the ground)
No, no we're not. Unas? What does Sokar have on you that makes you
so dang cranky?
[The Unas pulls on the chain that links the prisoners together and
jerks him to his feet. He leads them out of the village as Simon
watches.]
EXT--RIDGE (DAY)
[SG-1, along with Mary, are led by the Unas along the top of a ridge.
O'Neill glances down the slope and silently signals to the others to be
ready to move.]
DANIEL
(quietly)
Mary, we're gonna take a little tumble, so just scrunch up in a ball
and roll with the rest of us.
[O'Neill nods to the others and they dive down the slope, rolling all
the way to the bottom. The end of the chain is jerked out of the Unas'
grasp, who roars in anger and starts after them.]
O'NEILL
Go! Go!
[Mary, at the front of the chain, leads them through the woods.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE (DAY)
[Simon approaches the Canon.]
CANON
Simon! You've always been quick to ask questions. This weakness
shall be your doom. If you persist, I shall be unable to defend you
when the next Sacrifice is called.
[As he wanders off, Simon leaves.]
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[SG-1 and Mary are still running through the woods. They are brought to
a halt as the Unas steps on the trailing chain.]
UNAS
You cannot escape me.
[Simon appears, with SG-1's gear and Teal'c's staff weapon.]
SIMON
(to the Unas)
Leave them!
UNAS
You dare to challenge me?
O'NEILL
(to Simon)
Shoot it!
UNAS
(to Simon)
You shall join them in hell.
[The Unas drives the end of the chain into the tree, preventing SG-1
and Mary from escaping.]
MARY
Simon!
UNAS
(to SG-1)
You will remain here until I finish with this one.
[He heads towards Simon.]
O'NEILL
(to Simon)
Shoot it!
MARY
Simon!
O'NEILL
Shoot!
[Simon fires Teal'c's staff weapon and strikes the Unas in the chest.
Green blood appears from the wound.]
O'NEILL
Again!
[Simon fires again, but the Unas keeps coming until he is right before
Simon.]
O'NEILL
(to Simon)
Shoot!
[Simon shoots the Unas at point blank range, but still fails to kill
it.]
UNAS
For this you will pay with your life.
[The Unas knocks away the staff and backhands Simon, sending him flying
across the clearing.]
MARY
Simon!
[Simon gets to his feet and runs away, the Unas following. O'Neill sees
Teal'c's discarded staff weapon.]
O'NEILL
Mary, the staff.
[They stretch out the length of chain allowing Mary to reach for the
staff. She finally manages to get hold of it and passes it to Daniel,
who passes it to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
[O'Neill shields his eyes as Teal'c shoots the chain holding them to
the tree.]
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[The injured Unas is still tracking Simon. It pauses and roars in fury.
Simon hears it and continues to run for his life.]
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[Teal'c shoots the length of chain holding O'Neill, releasing him. The
others have already been freed.]
O'NEILL
Carter, Daniel, head toward the Gate. Take Mary with you.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
[They help Mary away.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Shall we?
[They head off after the Unas.]
EXT--CLEARING (DAY)
[Simon pauses to lean against a large rock, attempting to catch his
breath. The Canon comes round the rock and grabs him.]
CANON
Simon! Simon! What have you done?
SIMON
The demon comes. Release me.
[They look up in fear as the Unas approaches them. Simon puts himself
in front of the Canon.]
EXT--WOODS (DAY)
[O'Neill and Teal'c are hurrying through the woods, attempting to catch
up with Simon and the Unas.]
EXT--CLEARING (DAY)
UNAS
(to Simon)
Your God has abandoned you.
[Simon faces the Unas.]
SIMON
My God is with me always.
[The Unas hits him and knocks him out, then goes after the Canon.]
EXT--CLEARING (DAY)
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter the clearing to find the Unas apparently dead
and the Canon crouched over Simon's unconscious body. Teal'c runs over
to make sure that the Unas really is dead, while O'Neill checks Simon.]
O'NEILL
He's all right.
(to the Canon)
What happened?
CANON
Simon...stood before it like...like David before Goliath. The demon
threw him aside and then he fell. As you can see.
[Teal'c holds his hand over the Unas' mouth, but feels no breath.]
CANON
It was a miracle.
TEAL'C
The Unas' wounds were too severe. Even the Goa'uld within him could
not save him.
O'NEILL
(to the Canon)
So, not a demon.
CANON
As you say. You've opened my eyes. Bless you.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well. Let's have the ring.
CANON
Yes. Of course.
[As he tosses the ring to O'Neill, Simon wakes up.]
SIMON
I'm alive?
TEAL'C
Sokar will be awaiting the return of the Unas. He will send others.
O'NEILL
(to Simon)
Which is why you've got to bury the Circle of Darkness after we've
gone through. Can you walk?
[They help Simon to his feet and leave the clearing.]
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)
[Daniel, Carter and Mary are waiting by the Stargate as O'Neill,
Teal'c, Simon and the Canon approach.]
MARY
Simon!
[She runs over to him and they hug.]
MARY
I knew you would come. Are you hurt?
SIMON
I will be fine.
DANIEL
What happened?
CANON
The beast...is dead. Had I not witnessed it myself, I would not have
believed it. Thank you...all, for showing me the way.
O'NEILL
You're welcome. Major, dial us home.
[Carter starts to dial Earth, but pauses after the first chevron is
lit.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
[She looks at the Canon.]
CARTER
It went into him.
SIMON
What went into him?
[The Canon starts to move forward and Teal'c aims his staff weapon.]
TEAL'C
Go no further!
CANON
Why? I have done nothing.
(to Simon and Mary)
My children...
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Are you sure?
CARTER
Positive, Sir. I can sense it. The Unas host was dying, it had no
where else to go. It went into him.
[The Canon's eyes light up and he lunges at them. O'Neill shoots him
with his sidearm and the Canon falls backwards. Carter goes to check on
him and Simon kneels at his side.]
CANON
Forgive me.
[After a moment, he dies.]
SIMON
(praying)
By the sorrows ye suffered, in your agony in the garden, in your
scourging and crowning with thorns...
DANIEL
The prayer for Suffering Souls.
SIMON
(cont'd)
In your crucifixion and death, have mercy on the souls. Deliver them
from the dire torments they endure and admit them to your most sweet
embrace in Paradise.
[He makes the sign of the cross on the Canon's forehead. Mary crosses
herself.]
SIMON
Now the demon is truly gone.
O'NEILL
Major?
[Carter nods and heads back to the DHD to dial home.]
O'NEILL
(to Simon and Mary)
You know what to do?
MARY
Yes. We will do what you say.
SIMON
We will bury the Gate. Immediately. And there will be no more
Sacrifices.
O'NEILL
Thank God.
[Carter presses the centre stone and Stargate opens. She sends the GDO
signal back to Earth and SG-1 step through the Stargate, leaving Simon
and Mary in the clearing.]
FADE OUT
THE END
