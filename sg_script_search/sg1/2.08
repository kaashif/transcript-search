TEASER
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is spinning into activity.]
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
(Over PA system)
Unscheduled incoming traveller.
[SFs pile into the Gate room and take up defensive positions. Hammond
and O'Neill are seen through the window rushing to the Command
console.]
HAMMOND
There's no one scheduled to return today. Did you get an iris code?
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
Yes, sir we did. From SG-1.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate activates as the rest of SG-1 enter the control room.
O'Neill seems surprised to see them.]
O'NEILL
(To his team)
Hi. How are ya?
HAMMOND
The only other person with an SG-1 remote and the signal that goes
with it is...
TEAL'C
Tek-mate, Bra'tac.
DANIEL
But he's not supposed to use it unless it's an emergency.
TEAL'C
Perhaps he is under attack.
CARTER
From who? Apophis and Klorel were killed.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[The female technician types in the command on her computer, and the
iris opens. SFs raise their weapons while SG-1 look on warily.
Momentarily, Bra'tac steps through the Gate and stands at the top of
the ramp.]
BRA'TAC
Hammond of Texas, will you give me leave to enter your compound?
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
You have it, Master Bra'tac. Unit, stand down.
[Hammond and SG-1 leave the Control Room.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[O'Neill leads the group into the Gate room to greet Bra'tac. O'Neill
approaches him and shakes his hand.]
O'NEILL
Bra'tac, greetings from Earth.
BRA'TAC
Hmm! Hasshak.
O'NEILL
I take it this isn't a...social call.
[Bra'tac moves past O'Neill as he is talking over to greet Teal'c, who
is smiling warmly at his friend. They shake hands.]
BRA'TAC
(Solemnly)
Greetings, old friend. I bring bad news.
TEAL'C
(Alarmed)
My family?
BRA'TAC
Your wife is safe.
TEAL'C
What of Rya'c?
BRA'TAC
Your son has been taken...by Apophis.
[Teal'c's face is a filled with fear and outrage as the scene fades.]
END TEASER
ROLL OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, SG-1, and Bra'tac have gathered around the table.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, your report stated clearly that Apophis was killed on board
his ship.
O'NEILL
Yes, it did, sir. We saw the thing blow.
CARTER
Nobody could have survived, sir.
BRA'TAC
I am told he and Klorel escaped through the on-board Stargate before
your explosive devices destroyed the ship.
DANIEL
They must have used those rings things to get to the Gate just after
I did.
HAMMOND
What does Apophis gain by kidnapping Teal'c's son?
TEAL'C
He does not want Rya'c. He wants the Shol'va, the traitor. He wants
Teal'c.
BRA'TAC
Teal'c is right. Nearly all the warriors and serpent guards loyal to
Apophis died on those two ships. Apophis returned to Chulak in
shame.
TEAL'C
He must act quickly to reinstate his power, or the system lords will
send another Goa'uld to eliminate him and rule in his place.
BRA'TAC
Right now, there is a measure of chaos in Chulak. His guard is
weakened. If we use this time wisely, we can rescue the boy.
HAMMOND
I can't allow my best people to walk into what is obviously a trap.
O'NEILL
Of course it's a trap sir. And in knowing it's a trap, we can avoid
it.
(To Bra'tac)
He's vulnerable right now.
BRA'TAC
He never will be more so. And I still have a few friends among the
serpent guards that Apophis does not know of.
O'NEILL
If we can pull this off, sir, we can grab Teal'c's kid and nail this
mother...Goa'uld in one sweep.
HAMMOND
(Pausing, then to Teal'c)
Teal'c, you originally withheld information about your family
because you were afraid it would make you vulnerable. Well, it has.
I want this must be the last time. So, Colonel, you have a go. Get
Apophis if you can, but the prime directive of this mission is to
bring Teal'c's family back to Earth.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
EXT--CHULAK STARGATE
[There are several Jaffa guarding the gate when it activates. A green
metal container bounces out of the gate and a couple of cylinders break
out of the container. Just as the puzzled Jaffa are approaching to
investigate, the canisters release a gas that knocks out the Jaffa.
SG-1 and Bra'tac step through the gate wearing gas masks and robes. The
Stargate closes and the team guardedly walk through the fallen Jaffa.]
EXT--CHULAK--THE TOWN BUILT INTO THE MOUNTAINS
EXT--CHULAK--AN ALLEY
[Bra'tac leads them as they sneak along the darkened street.]
BRA'TAC
This is our destination.
O'NEILL
Who lives here?
BRA'TAC
Drey'auc has offered her new home as a base.
TEAL'C
But how could she afford such a home?
BRA'TAC
I do not know.
[Bra'tac moves on, and Teal'c looks at O'Neill. Then, they follow
Bra'tac to the door of the house.]
INT--DREY'AUC'S HOME
[They enter the home and Drey'auc rises to greet them. She sees Teal'c
and is stunned and overwhelmed to see him.]
DREY'AUC
Teal'c?
[They embrace.]
DREY'AUC
I was alone when they came. I tried to stop them.
TEAL'C
Of this, I am certain.
[From upstairs, a man looks on the group and smiles.]
FRO'TAK
Teal'c!
[He descends the stairs.]
FRO'TAK
Master Bra'tac! You are the warriors from the Tau'ri. I have heard
much of you.
[He stands before them.]
FRO'TAK
I am Fro'tak of the High Cliffs.
O'NEILL
Jack of the Windy City. This is Jackson and Carter.
FRO'TAK
My thanks for your coming.
TEAL'C
Your presence in the home of my wife is greatly appreciated,
Fro'tak.
FRO'TAK
It is my home, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
It was you who provided shelter for my wife and son.
DREY'AUC
Teal'c...
FRO'TAK
I will tell him. When it appeared that you may never return, that
you may indeed be dead, Drey'auc had her marriage removed. She is
now my wife, Teal'c.
[Teal'c reaches out and violently grabs Fro'tak's throat. He struggles
against Teal'c. O'Neill rushes in to break things up.]
O'NEILL
My God! Hey, knock it off! Come on, come on! Knock it off! Knock it
off! You came here for your son. This doesn't help.
[Teal'c settles down.]
FRO'TAK
I wished to be the one to tell you myself, old friend. I am sorry.
TEAL'C
(Glaring at Bra'tac)
How could you not have known this, Bra'tac?
[Bra'tac can only return Teal'c's gaze.]
FRO'TAK
We will wait outside, and give you time to sort through
this...uncomfortable news.
[Fro'tak guides Drey'auc out.]
O'NEILL
(Clears his throat)
Captain Carter, why don't you go with them? See what you can find
out about the kid.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[She leaves with them, and Bra'tac approaches Teal'c.]
BRA'TAC
Teal'c, on my word as a warrior, I did not know. If I had, I would
have told you before we arrived.
[Teal'c turns an walks to the table.]
O'NEILL
Look, I just want to know if this guy, Fro'tak, can be trusted not
to turn us in.
TEAL'C
(Not looking at them)
Is it not obvious, O'Neill? He cannot be trusted.
O'NEILL
Well, no offense, Teal'c, but I don't think that assessment is born
of a cool head. What do you think, Bra'tac?
BRA'TAC
Fro'tak is one of Teal'c's oldest confidants. Both were my wards in
the Bashaak training. He has indicated to me many times that he
agrees with my beliefs that the Goa'ulds are false gods.
O'NEILL
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can he be trusted?
BRA'TAC
I believe so, yes. But I suggest we keep a close eye on him at all
times.
TEAL'C
A better response would be to kill him.
BRA'TAC
Teal'c! You cannot.
DANIEL
Teal'c...Look, I know you probably don't want to hear this now, but
I think you need to get some perspective on this. Maybe, in a way,
you should be thanking him.
TEAL'C
(Turning to face Daniel)
How can you say that, Daniel Jackson? He has betrayed our
friendship.
DANIEL
If I recall, last time we were here, you were pretty upset about
your family being outcasts, barely surviving in a camp because of
what you did. I mean it seems to me they have a better life now.
[Bra'tac approaches Teal'c.]
BRA'TAC
Teal'c, listen to me. If you were dead, would you wish Drey'auc to
remain alone forever?
TEAL'C
I am not dead.
BRA'TAC
In your current situation you may as well be. How long before you
return to provide for her?
TEAL'C
You know I cannot answer this.
BRA'TAC
Yes...as does she. Dr Jackson is right. Fro'tak has high station in
Chulak. Thanks to him, your family is no longer outcast.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I know it's tough, but you've got to focus on your boy.
BRA'TAC
Before we proceed, give me your word you will not commit Kel Mar
Tokeem.
TEAL'C
I give you my word.
BRA'TAC
Then I will retrieve Fro'tak and your wife, and we will begin
planning for the rescue of your son.
O'NEILL
Del Mar Hokeem?
DANIEL
That means something like "revenge by the wearer of horns". Which
I'm guessing is a Jaffa term for being a...cuckold.
O'NEILL
Hello.
[A tearful Drey'auc enters the house followed closely by Carter and
Fro'tak. Teal'c does not face her.]
TEAL'C
We will find Rya'c and bring him home. This I swear.
DREY'AUC
Thank you, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
After that is done,
[He turns slowly to face her.]
TEAL'C
I will never lay eyes on you again.
[Teal'c walks past her and exits the house, leaving Drey'auc in tears.]
EXT--CHULAK--OUTSIDE FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Teal'c disgustedly sits on a bench against the wall of the house.
Drey'auc, alone, comes out to speak to him. She stands before him.]
DREY'AUC
How dare you judge me and dishonor Fro'tak in his own house after
what you have done?
TEAL'C
Woman, be silent.
DREY'AUC
That is not an answer, Teal'c! You were the one who abandoned us.
TEAL'C
What I did was for the future of my people.
DREY'AUC
What I have done is for future of our son.
TEAL'C
Perhaps--But why Fro'tak?
DREY'AUC
Because he was the only one who asked.
TEAL'C
Do you have love for him?
[She turns her gaze away from Teal'c. Teal'c stands and faces her.]
TEAL'C
Do you have love for him?
DREY'AUC
(Stares back at Teal'c)
No, Teal'c. But Rya'c, our son, deserves a better life than the
camps. And Fro'tak has offered it to him.
[She turns and leaves Teal'c standing there.]
INT--CHULAK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Fro'tak is standing as a cabinet at the side of the room. He pulls out
a large scroll.]
FRO'TAK
Rya'c is being held in the west wing of the palace where I work.
[Fro'tak goes over to the table and unrolls it for SG-1 and Bra'tac to
look over. Teal'c is standing against the wall.]
FRO'TAK
It is less than 200 paces away. I know it well. I have made a map.
This is the main corridor. My place of work is here, in the Hall of
Recording. The guarded room is at the opposite end.
[Teal'c walks over to peer over Fro'tak's shoulder.]
TEAL'C
There is an entrance near that end utilized only for the changing of
the guard. The west wing is the most isolated part of the palace.
CARTER
So we should be able to get in and out pretty quickly before anyone
could get there.
O'NEILL
We go as soon as it's dark.
EXT--CHULAK--THE PALACE
INT--CHULAK--CORRIDOR OF WEST WING OF THE PALACE
[Bra'tac is walking along the corridor reaches a corner. Spying some
guards at the end of the new corridor, he props his staff weapon up
against the wall and walks into view of them.]
BRA'TAC
Jaffa, kree! Tel ra nel t'ko!
[The guards leave their post and follow after Bra'tac. Just as they are
about to turn the corner, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel come around and
zat them. Teal'c is up ahead and attacks the one guard who remained at
post, shooting him with his staff. O'Neill leads the team as they rush
ahead. He places some explosive on the door.]
O'NEILL
Clear!
[Carter pushes a button on the remote detonator and the explosive blows
the lock away. O'Neill pushes the door open and Rya'c, who is seated in
a chair, bolts out the door and begins running down the hall. Teal'c
snags him and tries to turn him around.]
RYA'C
Help, guards! Help me!
TEAL'C
(Turns him around to face him)
Do not be afraid, Rya'c. You are safe.
RYA'C
Get away from me! Shol'va!
CARTER
(Surprised)
What is he doing?
RYA'C
Help, Guards! The traitor's here! Help!
[A serpent guard comes around the corner and aims his staff at them.]
TEAL'C
Silence!
[The staff blast explodes on the door next to O'Neill, and Rya'c
escapes Teal'c's grasp and runs to more guards who have made their way
to the corridor. Teal'c shoots his staff, killing one of the guards.]
O'NEILL
We're outta here! Lets go! Lets go!
[R'yac ducks around a corner near the Serpent Guards, and Teal'c looks
on helplessly.]
BRA'TAC
Teal'c!
[He grabs Teal'c and drags him after them.]
INT--CHULAK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Fro'tak is lighting a fire in the fireplace. Drey'auc is pacing. The
front door opens and the five return. They are not happy.]
DREY'AUC
(Approaching them)
What happened? Where's my son?
O'NEILL
He's all right. We just ran into some problems.
TEAL'C
It is far worse than that, O'Neill. Rya'c's body lives, but his
heart and mind has been destroyed.
DREY'AUC
What are you saying?
TEAL'C
He is now with Apophis.
BRA'TAC
The boy was a stranger. A beast!
O'NEILL
Oh, come on! The kid's brainwashed.
DREY'AUC
(Angrily)
You promised...you would bring him home!
TEAL'C
Hear me, woman. He called me traitor and sought protection from the
guards. Apophis is punishing me for my betrayal.
DREY'AUC
(Tearful)
But he's...just a child. My child!
[Carter looks on uncomfortably.]
[Teal'c moves away from Drey'auc, regret etched in his face.]
TEAL'C
You cannot feel more contempt for me than I hold for myself.
[Slowly, Drey'auc approaches him from behind.]
DREY'AUC
This was not your doing, Teal'c.
[Suddenly, the Goa'uld communications device activates. Teal'c,
Drey'auc, and Fro'tak go over to it.]
O'NEILL
What's goin' on?
BRA'TAC
Apophis is about to address the people of Chulak.
CARTER
That should be interesting.
[They join Teal'c before the device.]
APOPHIS
(His image appears on the device)
People of Chulak, rumours of my defeat are false, spread by traitors
who would destroy our world. I bring you the truth, proof of my
power to conquer evil and forgive transgression. Witness...my most
loyal subject...
(Ry'ac joins Apophis in the viewfinder)
Rya'c, son of Teal'c!
RYA'C
(Addressing the audience)
My father is not a hero. He is evil. He turned away from our god,
our people, even his own family. He is a Ha'taaka!
[Teal'c looks on disheartenedly.]
APOPHIS
My people, this Ha'taaka is now among us, here in Chulak. I will
give one million shesh'ta to the Jaffa who brings Teal'c to me alive
and another million for the heads of those who are with him.
O'NEILL
(Dryly)
Well, if you've got a price on your head, you're doing your job.
RYA'C
The evil ones have my mother. She is their prisoner. Help us save
her. My mother is Drey'auc of the Morning Cham'ka Groves.
[Teal'c's head snaps up at this last statement.]
BRA'TAC
This was to be expected.
DANIEL
I don't get that part about us having his mother? I mean no one took
Drey'auc.
TEAL'C
(Excitedly)
You are correct, Daniel Jackson. Rya'c has given me hope. Perhaps my
son is not lost to me.
O'NEILL
(Puzzled)
Where do you get that?
TEAL'C
He is fighting this brainwashing you spoke of. His last words were a
hidden message to me.
CARTER
The thing about us holding his mother?
TEAL'C
He called her Drey'auc of the Morning Cham'ka Groves.
DREY'AUC
But I am of the Cord'ai Plains. Rya'c knows this.
TEAL'C
Only too well. In the past, I have taken him to the Cham'ka Groves
to play.
DANIEL
Morning Cham'ka Groves...he wants us to go there in the morning.
TEAL'C
He has given us a way to free him.
BRA'TAC
(Cautiously)
Teal'c, I know he is your son, but this is a wisdom far beyond his
years.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I'm kinda with Bra'tac on this one. The boy had a chance to
come with us the first time. I kinda think it's wishful thinking,
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
(Strongly)
It is not wishful thinking, O'Neill! My son is strong. He is
fighting this brainwashing you spoke of. It has simply taken him
this long to win the battle.
[There is knocking at the door. O'Neill jumps up to intercept Fro'tak.]
O'NEILL
Expecting someone?
[Fro'tak sidesteps O'Neill as he heads toward the door. There is more
insistent pounding on the door now. O'Neill readies his weapon for
firing.]
EXT--CHULAK--THE DOOR OF FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Fro'tak opens the door to see several armed Jaffa outside. He walks
through the door and closes it behind him.]
JAFFA
We have orders to search for the traitor and his friends.
INT--CHULACK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[All are looking at the door.]
DREY'AUC
Hurry! This way.
[Drey'auc shows them into a secret entrance in one of the walls, as
O'Neill stands guard.]
EXT--CHULAK--THE DOOR OF FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
FRO'TAK
The criminals have abducted my wife! It makes no sense that they
would be here. You are welcome to enter, but I think Apophis would
be very angry that you wasted valuable time searching the home of
the victim.
JAFFA
(Angrily)
This is done by his order!
(To his subordinates)
Quickly! There!
[He points and the Jaffa walks through the house. He gets to the
entrance in the wall just after O'Neill and the others have closed it
behind them. The Jaffa stands near the wall, but sees nothing.]
INT--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE--THE DARKENED HIDING PLACE
[O'Neill and company quietly look on as the Jaffa stands near.]
INT--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[The Jaffa signals the other as other Jaffa leave other areas of the
house that they've searched. They all return and stand before Fro'tak
at the door. For a moment he glares at Fro'tak.]
JAFFA
Next house.
[The Jaffa leave, and Fro'tak closes the door behind them. SG-1 start
to come out of their hiding place, with Teal'c emerging first. Fro'tak
approaches them and Teal'c stands before Fro'tak and stare each other
down for a moment.]
TEAL'C
Until this moment, Fro'tak, I was not certain you could be trusted.
FRO'TAK
We are old friends, Teal'c. I would hope you never lose your trust
in me.
[O'Neill and Carter exchange wary glances.]
EXT--CHULAK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
INT--CHULAK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Drey'auc walks out onto the balcony overlooking the great room and
sees Teal'c pacing below. Teal'c turns to see Drey'auc has joined him.
Hesitatingly, she approaches him.]
DREY'AUC
I will not sleep either...
[She moves closer and appears to touch Teal'c as he reacts by looking
down at his arm.]
DREY'AUC
...until our son is safe.
[Drey'auc moves closer still, and she and Teal'c begin kissing. Fro'tak
appears at the top of the stairs and sees them. Angrily, he turns
away.]
[Some time later, Fro'tak is sneaking out of the house with his robe
slung over his shoulder. He leaves, but O'Neill sees him leave, having
staked out the exit from a hiding place.]
EXT--CHULAK--THE PALACE
INT--CHULAK--THE WEST WING OF THE PALACE
[A Jaffa guard is patrolling the corridor and Fro'tak appears. He sees
the guard.]
FRO'TAK
Guard!
[The Serpent Guard approaches him.]
FRO'TAK
I will lead you to the traitor, Teal'c, and his evil companions.
[Just then O'Neill walks around the corner and zats the guard twice,
surprising Fro'tak. Fro'tak looks at O'Neill, pulls a knife and begins
advancing on him.]
O'NEILL
Don't!
[O'Neill holds up a warning finger, but Fro'tak keeps coming. O'Neill
zats him.]
FRO'TAK
(Falling to the ground)
Jaffa, kree!
[O'Neill leaps upon him, clamping a hand over his mouth.]
O'NEILL
(Whispering roughly)
Shut up! It does not have to go down like this! Nice and quiet. Come
on.
[O'Neill starts to pull Fro'tak up from the floor.]
FRO'TAK
(Screaming)
Jaffa!
[O'Neill drops him and zats him again. He looks around and then zats
him a third time, and Fro'tak disintegrates. Footsteps can be heard and
O'Neill disappears behind a door as three Jaffa arrive to find the
Jaffa O'Neill killed.]
JAFFA
Seal off the palace. No one comes or goes!
[They take off as O'Neill peeks out from behind the door.]
INT--CHULAK--FRO'TAK'S HOUSE
[Teal'c, now in SGC green BDUs, and Drey'auc are sitting together on a
settee, his hand resting tenderly on her knee. Bra'tac paces when
suddenly, there is a knock at the door. Bra'tac quietly signals
everyone to be ready. Carter and Daniel, who have also shed their
robes, join Teal'c and Drey'auc behind the shelter of a wall. With
their weapons raised, Bra'tac moves to open the door. A serpent guard
comes in, helmet on.]
BRA'TAC
(Holding a zat to his side)
How dare you enter like this! This house has already been searched.
[He points his weapon at the guard, who leans the staff weapon against
a wall.]
O'NEILL
(Deactivating the serpent helmet)
No wonder these guys are always cranky.
[The others come out of their hiding place.]
O'NEILL
Get me out of this thing.
DANIEL
(Giving him a hand)
Jack, where the hell have you been?
[O'Neill looks regretfully at Drey'auc as she approaches.]
DREY'AUC
What of Fro'tak?
O'NEILL
(Pausing)
He left here last night and made a beeline for the palace. He was
turning us in. I had to stop him. I'm sorry.
BRA'TAC
I never thought he would betray us.
DREY'AUC
The fault is mine. I made vows I could not keep.
[She turns away mournfully, while the others watch. Teal'c goes to her
and holds her.]
O'NEILL
The suns are coming up. Let's get the kid.
EXT--CHULAK--THE CHAM'KA GROVES
[Rya'c and five Jaffa are walking between trees. We see O'Neill and
Bra'tac hiding.]
O'NEILL
(Into his radio)
All right, listen up. This cannot be a firefight. We go CTT, one
shot, one kill, my command.
[Daniel and Carter listen from their positions as O'Neill continues on
his radio.]
O'NEILL
Take the target nearest your position.
[The Jaffa march ahead of Rya'c, and O'Neill takes aim with his zat.]
O'NEILL
(Into his radio whispering loudly)
Go!
[O'Neill fires his zat, and simultaneously the others fire at the
Jaffa. They are taken out and Rya'c looks around, a bit frightened.
They all come out of their hiding places and Teal'c rushes to greet
him. Rya'c runs to him.]
RYA'C
Father!
TEAL'C
Rya'c!
[They embrace.]
RYA'C
I never meant to hurt you, Father.
[Rain pours down as the rest of the team join Teal'c and his son.
Teal'c is beaming.]
TEAL'C
Rya'c has returned.
CARTER
Does anyone besides me think this was just a little too easy?
DANIEL
Yeah careful, Teal'c, that was an awfully fast turnaround.
TEAL'C
My son is strong. His mind has overcome the lies Apophis placed
there.
O'NEILL
(Still suspicious)
Then you won't mind if Carter does a little search.
[Thunder rumbles around them as Rya'c looks at his father. Carter
approaches and a disgruntled Teal'c watches as she does a quick
pat-down.]
CARTER
I think he's clean, Colonel.
TEAL'C
If this were not Rya'c returned, this would have been a trap. It was
not.
O'NEILL
Not yet.
TEAL'C
Why do you doubt my son?
O'NEILL
It's my nature, Teal'c. I'm thinking Cassandra here. A little
naquadah bomb in the chest, get through the Gate--boom!
TEAL'C
My son is Jaffa. The symbiote within him would not allow such
tampering.
O'NEILL
Is that a fact...or a hope?
TEAL'C
It is a fact, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Well, it's not like we have much choice. Let's get a move on.
BRA'TAC
Go directly to the Stargate. I will bring the boy's mother.
[Bra'tac leaves in a different direction from the others.]
EXT--CHULAKIAN STARGATE
[Two guards stand at the gate. SG-1 look on from a rise overlooking the
gate.]
CARTER
I don't know, sir. I'm not likin' this one bit. Talk about too easy!
[Behind them, Bra'tac and Drey'auc have arrived. Teal'c stands with his
son.]
DREY'AUC
Rya'c!
[The boy rushes to his mother and they embrace, as Bra'tac goes on
ahead.]
RYA'C
Father's taking us to the Tau'ri!
[Mother and son embrace. O'Neill rises from his position and goes over
to them. Bending down, he motions for Rya'c to come close.]
O'NEILL
Hey, come here. All right, Rya'c...what's the scam here?
[Drey'auc looks at O'Neill.]
RYA'C
I do not understand.
O'NEILL
What're you up to? Or better yet...what has Apophis got you up to?
RYA'C
I fooled Apophis.
O'NEILL
Yeah? Then why the tantrum when we tried to take you the first time?
[Bra'tac turns to hear the answer.]
RYA'C
At the time I was not yet successful in defeating Apophis's control.
I am sorry. My mind is not as strong as my father's.
TEAL'C
O'Neill, why can you not accept the possibility that my son's mind
was simply too strong for Apophis to control?
O'NEILL
(To Teal'c)
Come here.
[O'Neill gets up and walks a short distance from Rya'c and Drey'auc.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I want you to be right, but it just doesn't track. Apophis
knows we're here, and there's only two guards at the Gate.
BRA'TAC
Apophis has very few serpent guards still loyal to him. In two days,
we have killed many of those few. Perhaps he cannot spare more.
DANIEL
O'Neill, even if this is a trick, what are we going to do?
Just...stay here?
CARTER
Daniel has a point. I mean, we may as well take advantage of the
light guard and at least get through the Gate.
O'NEILL
What about the boy?
TEAL'C
My son will not harm your world, O'Neill. I give you my word.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I know you mean that. But it might not prove to be that
easy.
DANIEL
So what are we going to do, just leave the boy here?
[O'Neill is clearly in a quandary. As he looks upon Drey'auc as she
holds her son, he makes a decision.]
O'NEILL
Bra'tac, stay here with Drey'auc and the boy. We'll clear the way.
[SG-1 descend the hill as the Jaffa are turned away. Taking up
positions behind one of the boulders surrounding the gate, O'Neill
signals the team by hand and all attack at once. Both Jaffa fall to zat
and staff fire. When the Jaffa are down, Bra'tac brings Drey'auc and
Rya'c, and Daniel dials the gate. Rya'c embraces his father once more.]
O'NEILL
Let's go. Everybody, move!
[The Stargate activates, and Carter sends the GDO signal.]
CARTER
Clear.
(To Drey'auc)
It's OK. You're perfectly safe. Come on.
[Daniel, Carter, and Drey'auc proceed through the event horizon.
Leaving Rya'c with O'Neill, Teal'c goes to Bra'tac.]
TEAL'C
Join us, old friend.
BRA'TAC
Another time.
TEAL'C
Once again, I owe you my thanks.
BRA'TAC
You owe me nothing. You have made an old teacher proud.
[They place a hand on each other's shoulder.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Teal'c and Rya'c exit the wormhole. Rya'c looks around in awe. O'Neill
finally arrives to see Teal'c, his wife and son hugging at the base of
the ramp while the alarm klaxons blare in the background. Armed SFs
look on in the background. O'Neill is still suspicious.]
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is peering into a microscope. O'Neill and Teal'c stand behind
her. She sighs.]
FRAISER
Well, no sign of anything abnormal. Not that I'm exactly an expert
in what's normal for a Jaffa his age.
O'NEILL
No sign of a bomb in his belly?
FRAISER
None. Like Teal'c says, I don't think it would work in a Jaffa.
TEAL'C
Now do you see, O'Neill? All is well.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I hope so, Teal'c. But I still want to keep a guard on him.
TEAL'C
I would do the same.
[He walks over to his son.]
RYA'C
Father says Tau'ri only has one sun. I cannot wait to see it!
[Drey'auc laughs. Rya'c turns to his father.]
RYA'C
When will I be able to see it?
TEAL'C
It will be a while, my son. You must be patient.
[Rya'c smiles. Drey'auc gets a funny look on her face. Teal'c notices
and she pulls Teal'c aside, leaving Rya'c sitting on the infirmary bed
as O'Neill looks on.]
TEAL'C
Something troubles you.
DREY'AUC
Before our son was taken, he was training with Master Bra'tac. He
lost two teeth that day. They are no longer missing.
[Teal'c grows concerned and O'Neill overhears. Teal'c turns to O'Neill
and they exchange a look and O'Neill moves closer to Rya'c.]
TEAL'C
Dr Fraiser?
[She goes over to join Teal'c as O'Neill approaches Rya'c.]
O'NEILL
So, um...Rya'c...what kind of food do you like?
RYA'C
I am not hungry. I wish to see the outside of your world.
O'NEILL
There's plenty of time for that.
FRAISER
Colonel?
O'NEILL
(To Rya'c)
We'll get to it.
FRAISER
Rya'c, um...I'm going to take a little blood sample. Then I'll be
finished. You'll feel a tiny sting, but that's all.
[Rya'c glowers at them suspiciously and suddenly explodes, pushing
Janet aside and jumping off the bed.]
RYA'C
No! Ahh!
[Teal'c grabs his son and holds him.]
RYA'C
You dare touch me, Ha'taaka! I'll kill you all!
TEAL'C
(Holding Rya'c still, and to Janet)
Do it quickly.
[Janet injects him in the arm with a sedative. Teal'c and Drey'auc lay
Rya'c back on the bed.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL
[An SF guards the door.]
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[Drey'auc and Rya'c are in the cell. Rya'c is lying on a bed and is
just regaining consciousness. Drey'auc sits down on the bed and strokes
her son's head.]
DREY'AUC
Rya'c...
[He wakes, turns to see her and reacts violently, pushing her away.]
RYA'C
Go away! I hate you!
[He gets up and races to the door, trying the handle, then pounding on
it.]
DREY'AUC
Rya'c!
RYA'C
You cannot stop me!
[Chomps his teeth together...twice. Then he feels his teeth, stunned.]
DREY'AUC
They're gone, son.
RYA'C
(Screaming)
I hate you! No, I want Apophis! I hate you! I hate you! Let me out!
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[A monitor showing Rya'c's tantrum is being viewed by Hammond, SG-1 and
Dr. Fraiser.]
HAMMOND
(Walking away from the monitor)
What the hell almost happened here?
FRAISER
The teeth were fake, hollow. Inside each tooth we found a different
biological organism, sort of like a virus. They both appear to be
dormant, harmless, until you combine them. Then they become
deadliest thing I've ever seen.
CARTER
If he bit down hard enough to break the teeth the two organisms
would begin to combine and multiply exponentially, releasing
themselves into the atmosphere.
DANIEL
So that's why he wanted to get outside so badly.
O'NEILL
Kinda sounds like anthrax.
FRAISER
This stuff makes anthrax look like a cold virus.
CARTER
(Referring to a map she has displayed on a computer monitor)
It would have taken less than two days for it to spread across North
America. Less than a week to spread around the world.
DANIEL
And what would it have done?
CARTER
Killed every living thing on Earth within 24 hours of contact.
HAMMOND
There isn't any chance the boy has another device implanted in his
body?
FRAISER
X-rays and CAT scans were negative, sir. All the other tests we ran
were normal.
DANIEL
OK, so...we're all right. Rya'c is all right. We just have to get
his mind back. And how do we do that?
CARTER
Deprogramming.
O'NEILL
It's...not exactly the kind of thing you want to put a kid through.
TEAL'C
From the time of birth all Jaffa are taught to be strong. Rya'c is
my son. He can withstand it.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL
[Drey'auc stands outside the door looking in. The rest of SG-1 are
waiting outside as well. Rya'c is heard yelling through the door.]
RYA'C
You cannot keep me here! Return me to Chulak, Ha'taaka! I hate you!
You're Shol'va! I hate you! You messed up my life! Return me to
Apophis! I hate you! Let me go, you cannot keep me here!
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[Rya'c turns from the door to face his father who is with him.]
RYA'C
Return me to Chulak, Ha'taaka!
TEAL'C
We will not.
RYA'C
Then go away! I wish never to see you again!
[He tries to hit Teal'c with a chair, and Teal'c catches it. Rya'c
releases it and walks past him, but Teal'c grabs Rya'c by the arms and
turns him to look into his face.]
TEAL'C
Apophis is a false god.
RYA'C
Apophis is my god.
TEAL'C
Then who am I, my son?
RYA'C
The traitor. A vile one.
TEAL'C
I am your father and I have much love for you.
RYA'C
My god loves me!
TEAL'C
If Apophis loves you, why did he ask that you destroy yourself?
RYA'C
Let me sleep!
TEAL'C
Why did Apophis ask that you to destroy yourself?
RYA'C
You are stupid! I told you, I would not have died.
TEAL'C
You are flesh and blood as I am, my son. Apophis lied to you.
RYA'C
(Pushing Teal'c's hands away)
You lied! You said you'd come back!
(Through gritted teeth)
But you never did!
[Rya'c turns from him and lies down, his back to Teal'c. Teal'c rises,
hurt by this revelation.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--EVENING
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[Rya'c goes to the door of the cell and punches it.]
RYA'C
I must return to Apophis!
TEAL'C
For what reason?
RYA'C
Because he loves me and I love him.
TEAL'C
Rya'c, my son, hear me. You must remember when we were a family.
Remember how you loved the satta-cakes your mother made for you?
[Rya'c is pacing irritably. He bangs his hand on the table. Drey'auc
looks on from the window of the door.] Remember the stories we told
by the fire at night, and how we laughed together? Rya'c, my son,
that is love.
[Rya'c looks contrite from a moment, smiles and walks toward this
father only to spit in his face. Rya'c then walks away disgustedly.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL
[Drey'auc turns away from the scene, upset. Teal'c comes out of the
room, stunned. He sees Carter comforting Drey'auc in an embrace.
Drey'auc turns to face Teal'c, and Teal'c approaches her. Fraiser and
the rest of SG-1 are also waiting in the corridor.]
TEAL'C
He has reason to hate me, which only strengthens the twisting of his
mind. Do you know of another way?
O'NEILL
(Pauses, then to Fraiser)
ECT?
FRAISER
Maybe.
TEAL'C
What is this ECT?
CARTER
Electro-convulsive therapy.
DANIEL
Whoa! Electroshock? Isn't that kind of...barbaric?
FRAISER
Actually, it's not so much anymore. It's done under anesthesia, now,
in a more controlled way. I just...don't know about using it on a
child, or for that matter a Jaffa. It could kill the Goa'uld larva
inside him.
TEAL'C
That would kill Rya'c. This ECT...is it similar to a zat'nik'tel
discharge?
O'NEILL
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
TEAL'C
A single zat'nik'tel discharge will not kill a Jaffa of any age, nor
the symbiote within.
FRAISER
Might work.
[O'Neill looks at Fraiser and shrugs.]
TEAL'C
(To Drey'auc)
It will cause him great pain.
DREY'AUC
I trust you know what is best.
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[Rya'c is lying on the bed. Teal'c and Drey'auc enter the room, and
Rya'c turns his face away from them. Drey'auc goes over to sit next to
her son on the bed. Teal'c squats down by the bed.
TEAL'C
Rya'c, you must arise. Your mother is here to help you.
RYA'C
I hate her. I want Apophis!
TEAL'C
Forgive me, my son.
[Teal'c stands as does Drey'auc, who can't watch. They stand back and,
with much difficulty, he shoots Rya'c with the zat.]
RYA'C
Aaagh!
[Rya'c convulses in pain. The rest of SG-1 are seen through the window
and are standing around uncomfortably. Rya'c stills, and Drey'auc
slowly turns him over and cradles his head in her hands.]
DREY'AUC
He barely draws breath.
TEAL'C
He is in great pain. There is an ancient song you used to soothe him
when he was but a baby.
[Drey'auc looks at Teal'c then back at Rya'c. Both parents are stroking
his head as he struggles though his pain.]
DREY'AUC
(singing)
Kel ma kree, Sha'shan, Kel na t'ai, Or'intani, Kel han'dai...
[Through the window, O'Neill approaches the door and looks on. Drey'auc
stops, too upset to go on.]
RYA'C
(starts to sing quietly)
Iti Sha'shan han'dai.
[Drey'auc smiles, overjoyed. Then Rya'c smiles, opening his eyes.]
RYA'C
Did you forget, Mother? Where are we, Mother?
[She laughs in happiness. And Rya'c sees his father, and is pleasantly
surprised.]
RYA'C
Father! You have returned home?
DREY'AUC
(Tearfully kissing her son's hand)
We are not in Chulak, my son.
RYA'C
But we are with Father?
DREY'AUC
Yes.
RYA'C
Then to me, we are home.
[Teal'c is unable to speak. Drey'auc kisses Rya'c, Teal'c takes Rya'c's
hand and looks to the door. He gives a small smile and nod to O'Neill
returns the nod from the window.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Klaxons are blaring and the Stargate is active as Hammond stands at
the Command console, his hand on the microphone. The team are in the
Gate room.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, you have a go!
DREY'AUC
(To the team)
I must thank you all again.
(She shakes hands with Carter)
I would very much like to stay and get to know you better.
DANIEL
Well, you wouldn't have much of a life here. You'd be virtual
prisoners.
CARTER
But you're welcome in the Land of Light and Tuplo's waiting on the
other side. They're good people.
O'NEILL
Yep, and they got tons of wide-open spaces where you can play and
misbehave.
[He hands Rya'c a baseball glove.]
RYA'C
W-what is it?
[Rya'c puts the glove on his head like a hat, while the others look on,
amused.]
O'NEILL
Well, I guess I'll have to come visit and explain a few things.
[O'Neill takes the hat off his head and puts a ball in it and places
them both back in his hands.]
TEAL'C
(To O'Neill)
I shall return.
[O'Neill nods, and Teal'c and his family turn and walk through the gate
and his friends look on. Fade to black.]
