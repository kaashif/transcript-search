TEASER
FADE IN
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[SG-1 and Jacob are looking out at Apophis' mothership.]
JACOB
He's arming weapons.
O'NEILL
Shields?
JACOB
Not responding. Not that they'd do much good anyway. That ship has
weapons powerful enough to penetrate our shields at full power.
CARTER
Hyperdrive?
JACOB
It's not responding. The blast wave that propelled us here did some
damage.
DANIEL
Can we communicate with them?
JACOB
And say what?
DANIEL
I don't know, don't shoot?
[Jacob thinks for a moment, then opens a communication channel to
Apophis' ship.]
SELMAC/JACOB
Kree, Lord Apophis. I am Selmac of the Tok'ra, commander of this
ship.
O'NEILL
Commander?
JACOB
(to O'Neill)
You want to bicker about rank right now?
[Apophis' image appears on the viewscreen.]
APOPHIS
Ona'ka, shel Apophis.
O'NEILL
He's looking a little pissed.
CARTER
We did just destroy his fleet.
APOPHIS
Rok ona ja kuna. Shel we how'akek.
JACOB
(translating the Goa'uld)
He's says it's time for us to die.
DANIEL
Uh, wait a sec, I don't know if you've checked your dashboard here,
but we're both way off course.
APOPHIS
Oroc ra, kree mak.
JACOB
He's saying he knows everything.
APOPHIS
Ona'kra ja'do.
JACOB
He's also saying there's nothing we can do to help him. He's going
to destroy us.
DANIEL
We surrender.
O'NEILL
What? Daniel?
DANIEL
It's either that or he blows us to pieces. I'm just trying to buy us
a little time here.
APOPHIS
Klavel ha.
[Apophis' image disappears.]
CARTER
What'd he say?
DANIEL
Too late.
END OF TEASER
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
O'NEILL
Can't stand it. What's he waiting for?
[Apophis' ship fires several blasts, all of them missing SG-1's ship. A
second, unidentified ship emerges from behind SG-1's ship, returning
fire.]
CARTER
What happened?
JACOB
I'm picking up another ship on sensors. It's coming in fast. They're
firing on Apophis.
[Jacob adjusts the controls, starting up the engines.]
CARTER
What are you doing?
JACOB
Getting the hell out of here.
EXT--SPACE
[SG-1's ship moves off as the two other ships continue to exchange
fire.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
JACOB
That ship is unlike anything on computer records.
CARTER
Well we are in a completely uncharted part of the universe.
O'NEILL
I'm enjoying their style. Shoot first, send flowers later. It works.
DANIEL
But it only fired on Apophis, right, not us.
CARTER
Well, his ship's a much bigger threat.
JACOB
You think they were trying to save us?
DANIEL
It's possible.
JACOB
We may still find out. We're not going to get far on sublight
engines. Whoever wins the fight will probably come looking for us.
He calls up on the viewscreen an image of the system they are in.
CARTER
Now what are you doing?
JACOB
This system is centred around a blue giant. If we can move close
enough to the coronasphere, the radiation should keep us off their
sensors.
O'NEILL
Excuse me? Radiation?
JACOB
The ship's hull will protect us. For a while.
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob flies the ship towards the giant.]
JACOB
We're entering the coronasphere. The good news is that we won't show
up on anyone else's sensors. The bad news is that our sensors will
be blocked as well.
CARTER
So when we're ready to go, we won't know if someone's out there,
waiting for us.
DANIEL
How long do we have?
JACOB
About an hour without full shields. Ten hours with. Sam, want to
give me a hand?
O'NEILL
I'd fix the shields first.
JACOB
Right, Jack.
[He and Carter leave the bridge.]
O'NEILL
Just a suggestion.
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob has a panel full of crystals open.]
JACOB
Are you ok?
CARTER
Just thinking about Teal'c.
(She checks her wristwatch)
Five minutes.
[The crystals inside the panel light up.]
JACOB
And nine hours. The shields are back online.
[He closes the panel and goes to open another one. Inside, some of the
crystal are burnt.]
JACOB
Oh boy.
CARTER
How bad is it?
JACOB
It's bad. The hyperdrive control crystals are all completely shot.
CARTER
We already used the back-ups.
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Daniel is sitting on the steps of the command chair while O'Neill
lounges behind him.]
DANIEL
I don't suppose you wanna...talk about what happened on Vorash.
O'NEILL
Not really.
DANIEL
Didn't think so.
[There is a pause.]
O'NEILL
We were ambushed, at the rings. Teal'c took one in the back. I
should have seen it coming.
DANIEL
I thought the key to a good ambush was to make sure that you don't
see it coming. My point is that I'm sure that you did your best.
O'NEILL
Apparently wasn't good enough.
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[The klaxon is sounding as the Stargate dials up.]
SERGEANT
(to Hammond)
Receiving Tok'ra IDC, Sir.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[He heads into the Gate room as the wormhole opens. Three Tok'ra exit
the Gate led by a woman.]
HAMMOND
(to the soldiers)
Stand down.
(To the Tok'ra)
Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond.
TOK'RA
I'm councilwoman Ren au of the Tok'ra.
HAMMOND
Would you please come this way? I assume you have news.
REN AU
Yes.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC
[Hammond leads Ren au into the briefing room.]
REN AU
We had two scout ships as close to the region as safety permitted.
Sensors confirmed the star did go supernova as planned. As far as we
can tell Apophis' fleet was in close proximity as it happened.
[They head into Hammond's office.]
HAMMOND
As far as you can tell?
REN AU
Our data only covers the time prior to the blast wave. An energy
burst of that magnitude blacks out sensor readings and will continue
to do so for some time. However, I can assure you, there is no way
for another ship to have survived.
HAMMOND
And there has been no communication from SG-1?
REN AU
No. A single, one-man pod was launched from Apophis' mothership
several minutes prior to the explosion.
HAMMOND
Apophis?
REN AU
It is possible. But that would mean he had anticipated the explosion
and his fleet should have escaped.
HAMMOND
Then who was it?
REN AU
We tracked the pod into Goa'uld occupied territory, but did not
follow further. There was one, possibly two subspace distortions
during the explosion that could be explained by ships attempting to
go into hyperspace. However, we are fairly confident they did not
make it out prior to being hit by the blast wave.
HAMMOND
So you're saying SG-1 did not survive.
REN AU
The possibility is extremely remote. If they had, they should have
contacted us by now. You can rest assured, whether or not SG-1
survived, their action has thrown the Goa'uld into chaos. The
resultant void in dominant power will have the remaining System
Lords fighting each other for years to come.
HAMMOND
Thank you.
REN AU
The Tok'ra are officially considering Selmac a fallen war hero.
HAMMOND
You'll forgive me for holding out hope a little longer. SG-1 has a
surprisingly good habit of beating the odds.
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob and Carter are working on a panel.]
JACOB
This is not going to work.
O'NEILL
(over ship's intercom)
Hey, uh, it's getting a little hot up here kids.
CARTER
(to Jacob)
We're running out of time.
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill and Daniel are sitting on the floor before the command chair,
flicking a ball back and forth between them. Jacob and Carter enter,
Jacob heading for the ship's controls.]
JACOB
The hyperdrive is history.
CARTER
We tried retrofitting some of the other crystals, but it didn't
work.
DANIEL
I thought you said it would take over a hundred years to get back
home even if we had the hyperdrive.
JACOB
Yup.
DANIEL
So, in the long term, what difference does it make?
JACOB
Well in the short term it will be hard to avoid enemy ships.
O'NEILL
Weapons and shields?
CARTER
Good for now.
O'NEILL
Good enough to cover our butts from whatever is out there?
JACOB
We'll see. Moving out of the coronaspshere. Sensors are coming back
online.
[The viewscreen picks up the readings of another ship.]
JACOB
Picking up one ship. It's Apophis.
O'NEILL
What about the other one?
JACOB
It's not out there.
DANIEL
Can Apophis see us yet?
JACOB
He should be able to, but he's not moving.
CARTER
Maybe his ship was damaged in the battle.
[Jacob checks the readings.]
JACOB
That's impossible.
O'NEILL
Care to share?
DANIEL
It says that there's no life signs on board.
EXT--SPACE
[SG-1's ship is flying closer to Apophis'.]
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Carter, O'Neill and Jacob are heading down the corridor.]
CARTER
What if the other alien ship comes back while we're over there?
JACOB
Without hyperdrive we're sitting ducks no matter where we are. If
Apophis' ship is damaged and we can repair it, we should. It's
faster, has more advanced weaponry and superior shields.
O'NEILL
It still got its fanny whopped.
JACOB
We won't know what happened until we get there. At the very least,
we need hyperdrive control crystals.
[They enter the ring room.]
INT--RING ROOM, APOPHIS' MOTHERSHIP
[The rings appear, leaving O'Neill, Carter and Jacob on Apophis' ship.
They instantly raise their weapons. A voice is announcing a message in
Goa'uld throughout the ship.]
O'NEILL
What's he saying?
JACOB
Self-destruct is set. We have four minutes. I'll try and shut it off
from the pel'tec. Sam, you know where the crystals are?
CARTER
I'll get them.
JACOB
All right.
[Carter and O'Neill head one way, while Jacob goes another.]
INT--CORRIDOR, APOPHIS' MOTHERSHIP
[Carter and O'Neill are heading down the corridor, weapons at the
ready.]
CARTER
This way, Sir, it's not far.
O'NEILL
Carter, how do you know where to go in a place like this?
CARTER
I studied the Tok'ra specs of the ship while we were on Vorash.
O'NEILL
You know how to have a good time, don't'cha?
CARTER
I'm having a good time now, Sir.
O'NEILL
You go girl.
[They pause as they come across the bodies of many Jaffa. O'Neill
reaches down to one body, while Carter covers him.]
CARTER
Clear.
[O'Neill rolls the body over, finding the Jaffa dead.]
O'NEILL
Ew.
[Carter hears something and swings round, pointing her gun.]
O'NEILL
What was it?
CARTER
I don't know, but it sounds eerily familiar.
[They both hear the noise and swing round to see a replicator climbing
the wall.]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Jacob, do you read?
JACOB
(over the radio)
Yeah.
O'NEILL
Uh, we should get outta here.
INT--BRIDGE, APOPHIS' MOTHERSHIP
JACOB
(into his radio)
Yeah, I figured that.
[He backs away as dozens of replicators swarm over the walls and the
dead bodies of Apophis' Jaffa.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
DANIEL
Guys, what's going on?
CARTER
(over radio)
The ship's crawling with replicators.
JACOB
(over radio)
Sam, I'm not going to be able to shut down the auto-destruct. I'll
meet you back at the ring room.
CARTER
(over radio)
Still going to try and get the crystals.
JACOB
(over radio)
You have three minutes. Daniel, you're going to have to fly that
ship out of here as soon as we ring back aboard.
DANIEL
And you're going to have to tell me how to do that.
INT--RING ROOM, APOPHIS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob runs into the ring room to find it empty.]
JACOB
(into his radio)
Sam, Jack, one minute.
[There's no answer and he starts to run down the corridor.]
JACOB
(into his radio)
Sam! Jack! You read?
[He hears weapons fire and O'Neill and Carter come running down the
corridor with dozens of replicators after them.]
CARTER
Activate the rings!
[Jacob runs back to the ring room. Carter follows, while O'Neill
continues to shoot at the replicators. He enters the ring room and
slides into position just as the rings appear.]
INT--RING ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[They reappear back onto their ship.]
CARTER
We got 'em.
JACOB
Go Daniel!
[They quickly leave the room.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Daniel is at the controls, manoeuvring the ship away from Apophis'.]
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Carter, O'Neill and Jacob are running down the corridor.]
CARTER
There's not enough time to fix the hyperdrive, is there?
JACOB
We're going to have to hope the sublight engines can get us far
enough away.
CARTER
Of course, that's only going to matter if the replicators can't shut
down the auto- destruct.
JACOB
They'd have to learn to reprogram a Goa'uld computer awfully quick.
[They run onto the bridge.]
CARTER
It's possible, if they get control of that ship.
O'NEILL
Hey! You guys are just being too negative!
JACOB
We're not going to make it!
DANIEL
Going as fast as we can.
EXT--SPACE
[SG-1's ship is flying away from Apophis' mothership as it explodes.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
JACOB
Right, shut down the engines, divert full power to the shields!
DANIEL
(stepping out of his way)
Be my guest.
[Jacob takes the controls.]
EXT--SPACE
[The orange glow of the shields appear just as the blast wave from
Apophis' ship washes over them, leaving them undamaged.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
JACOB
That was close.
O'NEILL
I believe someone said...we're not going to make it.
JACOB
Sam, let's get the hyperdrive running.
[Jacob turns to leave but is stopped by O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Excuse me. I distinctly remember someone saying...we're not going to
make it. I think we made it.
JACOB
I'm sorry, I over reacted. At the time, it looked very much like we
weren't going to make it.
O'NEILL
Yes, well, maybe next time you'll just wait and see.
JACOB
And blow the last chance I might ever have to be right?
[He walks passed O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
(confused)
What?
CARTER
(grinning)
Welcome to my life.
[She follows Jacob out.]
O'NEILL
(still confused)
What?
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob replaces the crystals with the ones taken from Apophis' ship and
closes the panel. The engines light up and start to hum.]
JACOB
We're good to go.
DANIEL
(over ship's intercom)
Uh, engine room, this is pel'tec, engine room come in immediately.
JACOB
I think we've left him in charge once too often.
CARTER
What is it Daniel?
DANIEL
I'm picking up a ship on the sensors.
JACOB
Now what?
[They rush out of the engine room.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob checks the sensors.]
JACOB
Looks like someone must have escaped Apophis' mothership before the
bugs took over.
CARTER
Who?
JACOB
It's a Goa'uld cargo ship. I'm sending a hailing signal.
[There's no reply.]
JACOB
Nothing.
SELMAC/JACOB
I am Selmac of the Tok'ra, commander of this ship.
O'NEILL
(to Jacob)
You know, we really should talk about this commander thing.
SELMAC/JACOB
Identify yourself.
[An image appears on the viewscreen. It's Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c!
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
You made it!
TEAL'C
Apophis revived me in a sarcophagus. We fled his ship when the
replicators attacked.
O'NEILL
We?
JACOB
Sensors are picking up other life signs aboard the ship.
O'NEILL
Who you got with you, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
A few Jaffa who supported our cause. They helped me escape.
JACOB
Opening the cargo bay doors.
O'NEILL
Welcome back.
TEAL'C
Thank you, O'Neill.
INT--CARGO BAY, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel go to greet Teal'c. O'Neill shakes his hand
and gives him a hug.]
O'NEILL
Hey. Buddy.
[Teal'c suddenly jerks back, taking O'Neill's sidearm and pointing it
at him. Half a dozen Jaffa emerge with zat guns at the ready.]
O'NEILL
What'cha got going here, Teal'c?
[Apophis steps out from behind the Jaffa.]
APOPHIS
Well done Teal'c. Finally you have resumed your rightful position as
my First Prime.
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel enter an empty room, with Apophis' Jaffa
waiting outside. Teal'c continues to point O'Neill's sidearm at him,
then lowers it.]
O'NEILL
(quietly, to Teal'c)
All right, this is feeling like a strange plan, but just let me know
what to do and then...ah!
[Teal'c hits him in the face with the back of his hand, sending him to
the floor.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
DANIEL
Come on Teal'c, you don't really think that you're still First Prime
of Apophis.
[Teal'c points O'Neill's sidearm at him.]
TEAL'C
I have never ceased to be in the service of my god.
[O'Neill gets to his feet.]
O'NEILL
All right, that's sounding a little brainwashy. You don't believe
that guy's a god anymore than I do.
[Teal'c lowers the gun but doesn't answer.]
O'NEILL
What the hell's that suppose to mean? Come on, we're friends. Are
you trying to tell me you don't remember what's happened these past
fours years.
TEAL'C
I remember everything. It makes me ill to think I was forced to
pretend to be your friend. So many times I saved your life when I
wished I could watch you die.
O'NEILL
It hurts me that you would say that, but that's ok, because I know
its not true.
TEAL'C
Your belief is not necessary.
O'NEILL
It doesn't make any sense. Come on, you and I together have taken
down half a dozen Goa'ulds.
TEAL'C
Enemies of Apophis.
O'NEILL
And we kicked his ass twice. Hell, you sat around and watched him
die once.
TEAL'C
I knew he would be reborn more powerful than ever.
O'NEILL
I'm talking to a wall here. Anybody?
DANIEL
Teal'c, you remember when Apophis brainwashed your son Ry'ac?
[Teal'c turns and walks away.]
DANIEL
Consider the possibility.
[Teal'c touches a panel and the door closed, shutting SG-1 inside.]
DANIEL
Or don't.
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Teal'c keys a code into the door panel then turns to the waiting
Jaffa.]
TEAL'C
Unload the sarcophagus and the crates from the cargo ship.
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill is pressing random buttons on the inside door panel.]
O'NEILL
Got to wonder why they didn't put us in the brig.
CARTER
It's on one of the lower levels, it was probably damaged in the fire
fight.
O'NEILL
Think you can hotwire this thing?
CARTER
Well, I'd assume there's some sort of safety mechanism to ensure
against that. I mean, otherwise it would be pretty stupid to lock us
in here, wouldn't it?
O'Neill pauses.
CARTER
Of course, I could give it a shot...Sir.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[Carter starts to pry the panel off the wall.]
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Two Jaffa use the ring transporter to take a large crate from the
cargo ship onto the mothership. They stack it in a corridor with other
equipment, then leave. A hole appears on top of the crate as it is
eaten away from the inside.]
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jaffa are escorting Apophis' sarcophagus down the corridor. Jacob
emerges from his hiding place, armed with a zat, and watches them pass,
before heading in the opposite direction.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Apophis is examining Kronos' command chair.]
APOPHIS
Disgusting decoration.
JAFFA PILOT
Course has been plotted for Delmak. Diverting all power from shields
and weapons and entering hyperspeed.
[There is a subspace distortion as the ship goes into hyperspeed.
Teal'c enters, dressed as one of Apophis' Jaffa, and goes to one knee
before Apophis.]
APOPHIS
The Tok'ra Selmac is the spy who eluded capture.
TEAL'C
I will see to it personally, my Lord.
APOPHIS
I am sure you will not fail me, Teal'c.
[Teal'c rises and bows his head, before leaving.]
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Carter has managed to pry the panel from the wall and is fiddling with
the controls inside.]
CARTER
I really have no idea what I'm doing here.
O'NEILL
Keep trying, you may get lucky.
CARTER
Sir, I really hate to sound negative, but I think it's pretty safe
to say that without a little more insight into how these things
actually work, I've got pretty much zero chance of...
[The door slides open.]
CARTER
Ok, maybe not zero.
[Jacob appears.]
JACOB
Come on.
[They turn to leave, but are halted as Teal'c appears, pointing a staff
weapon at Jacob. A Jaffa relieves Jacob of his zat and radio.]
TEAL'C
Inside.
[Jacob enters the cell.]
O'NEILL
Come on Teal'c. A part of you has to know the truth.
TEAL'C
The truth is you are a prisoner of Apophis. When the symbiote that I
carry matures, you will become its host.
O'NEILL
Ok, I meant the other truth.
[Teal'c points his staff at the panel Carter was working on.]
JACOB
(to Carter)
Look out.
[Teal'c fires, destroying the panel. Carter ducks to one side and is
held by Jacob. Teal'c closes the door, sealing them in once more.]
INT--CORRDIOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
A Jaffa runs after Teal'c.
JAFFA
We shall die long before Delmak without new symbiotes.
TEAL'C
Apophis will live on and we shall serve him well until we die with
honour in his name.
[He continues down the corridor, followed by the Jaffa.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
JAFFA PILOT
My Lord, the internal sensors have shut down.
[Teal'c enters the bridge and shoves him aside.]
TEAL'C
Power is being diverted from the hyper engines.
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[There is a subspace distortion.]
CARTER
We just dropped out of hyperspeed.
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
TEAL'C
My Lord, the ship's systems are failing. I am unable to bring the
engines back online.
APOPHIS
Harok, kar'mel.
[Teal'c leaves and the Jaffa Pilot once more takes the controls.]
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Teal'c and two Jaffa enter the engine room. It is swarming with
replicators.]
INT--KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[The door of SG-1's cell slides open, but there is nobody there.]
O'NEILL
Odd.
[A replicator crawls inside.]
DANIEL
Uh-oh
O'NEILL
Uh, excuse me.
[He crawls over to the door and sees more replicators scuttle passed.]
O'NEILL
This could be a problem.
CARTER
Sir, if they've already got control of the primary systems...
O'NEILL
This could be a problem.
[The replicator that crawled inside is on the wall near Daniel,
watching him. It suddenly lunges towards him and Daniel jerks away.]
CARTER
It won't attack unless you threaten it.
DANIEL
Yeah! Still, maybe we should ah...
[They all crawl towards the door and duck under it.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
TEAL'C
(over ships' intercom)
My Lord. The ship is infested with replicators.
APOPHIS
How?
TEAL'C
I am unsure. They control the engine room.
APOPHIS
Destroy them.
TEAL'C
We cannot. There are too many of them and too few of us. We must...
[He is cut off. Apophis rises from his command chair and goes out into
the corridor.]
APOPHIS
Kree Jaffa.
[A half dozen Jaffa go with him, armed with staff weapons. Apophis
heads in one direction, only to come across replicators. They head the
other way, only to find more, cutting off their escape route.]
APOPHIS
Kree Jaffa!
[His Jaffa open fire on the replicators, who them attack en mass.
Apophis turns away and there is the sound of his Jaffa screaming as he
heads back onto the bridge.]
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[SG-1 run down the corridor, coming across the room where their
armaments are stored. There is a hole in the wall where a replicator
came through. They start opening crates and pulling out their
equipment, gearing up. Daniel sees a hole in the top of one of the
crates.]
DANIEL
Hello.
[Carter looks over as Daniel makes a gesture suggesting a replicator
crawled away from there.]
CARTER
It's been, what? Ten, eleven hours since we picked up the cargo
ship? The replicators have had more than enough time to reach
unmanageably large numbers.
JACOB
Let's just hope they left the cargo ship alone. It's our only way
out of here.
[He hands Carter a bulletproof vest and pulls his own on.]
CARTER
Chances are they have. I mean, they focus on controlling the
mothership first.
DANIEL
Well brainwashed or not, we can't just leave Teal'c here.
[O'Neill hands out their guns.]
O'NEILL
I know. You and Jacob secure the cargo ship. Carter, you're with me.
[She nods and hands him his bulletproof vest. O'Neill gives Daniel
extra clips for the gun. Jacob takes a large silver ball, a Goa'uld
stun grenade, from one of the crates and offers it to O'Neill.]
JACOB
You know how to use one of these?
[O'Neill takes the device.]
O'NEILL
Sure.
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Teal'c and five Jaffa are heading down the corridor.]
TEAL'C
We must ensure that Apophis reaches the cargo bay safely.
JAFFA
He is a god. Is he powerless against these demons?
TEAL'C
What you say is blasphemy. If I hear it again, I will kill you
myself.
JAFFA
If our weapons have no effect, what can we do?
TEAL'C
Human weapons will work. They are crated in the storage.
[He holds up his hand, halting them and listens intently. At the other
end of the corridor, O'Neill and Carter are waiting in ambush. Teal'c
slowly leads the Jaffa down the corridor. O'Neill takes the Goa'uld
stun grenade and rolls it towards them. Teal'c sees it and runs for
cover as there is a bright flash of light. They exchange weapons fire,
O'Neill and Carter managing to take out many of the Jaffa.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c! Better get off this ship. Now!
[They continue to exchange fire.]
INT--CARGO SHIP, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob and Daniel enter the cargo ship.]
JACOB
Atmospheric shield is online. Cargo bay is pressurised.
[He takes the pilot's chair and powers up the ship. Daniel sees the
cargo doors are closed.]
DANIEL
I have what may seem like a dumb question.
JACOB
Yeah?
DANIEL
Don't we need to open those big cargo bay doors in order to fly the
ship out?
JACOB
Well this ship has remote access to the door controls. Hopefully the
bugs haven't overridden it.
DANIEL
You, you don't wanna check?
JACOB
I don't wanna tip them off before we have to.
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[The firefight is continuing, with Teal'c the only Jaffa left.]
CARTER
Sir, we got to move!
[Teal'c goes to fire, but is distracted by a replicator. He fires on it
and it scuttles away, but O'Neill now has him covered. Teal'c swings
his staff around in preparation to fire and O'Neill is forced to fire
upon him. O'Neill and Carter quickly run over to him and Carter checks
for a pulse.]
CARTER
He's alive.
O'NEILL
Hope Junior keeps him that way.
[They begin to pick Teal'c up.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Apophis is at the pel'tec, attempting to adjust the controls. A
replicator climbs over the back of the command chair and he turns
around to see many more entering the bridge.]
INT--CARGO SHIP, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill and Carter haul an unconscious Teal'c onto the cargo ship.
Daniel takes Teal'c's arm as O'Neill releases him.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, here you go.
DANIEL
He's been shot.
O'NEILL
He resisted a little.
DANIEL
I was starting to worry to guys weren't going to make it.
JACOB
I didn't say it though.
[Carter and Daniel take Teal'c into the storage area of the ship.]
O'NEILL
Tie him up.
[Jacob takes the pilot's chair. There is a subspace distortion.]
O'NEILL
What was that?
JACOB
The mothership just jumped to hyperspeed.
O'NEILL
Now what?
JACOB
Now nothing. We can't open the cargo bay doors and fly out while
we're in hyperspace.
INT--CORRIDOR, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Carter, Jacob and Daniel are heading down a corridor, all
fully armed. Jacob and Carter find a control panel and call up the
mothership's details.]
JACOB
According to this, the ship is headed towards the last set of
co-ordinates that were entered. Sokar's old planet. Apophis' new
base.
CARTER
Uh, Dad.
JACOB
I see. The ship is travelling at ten times its capable hyperspeed?
CARTER
And the speed's still increasing. Twenty times, thirty. This is
incredible, the bugs must have modified the engines.
JACOB
They can do that?
CARTER
They can do almost anything. They're very advanced. The individual
blocks can come together to form whatever pattern they need to
achieve their goals.
DANIEL
But I though they didn't care about travelling fast.
CARTER
Only while they're multiplying. Once they've reached a critical
number they look for new sources of technology to consume.
JACOB
Then the information in the computer about Apophis' base must make
it look pretty appetising. This is great news. We'll be back in our
own galaxy in no time. When they come out of hyperspeed, we can jump
ship and fly home.
O'NEILL
I wouldn't exactly call it great news.
CARTER
We can't let the bugs get a foothold in our galaxy. These things are
relentless. Even the Asguard haven't been able to stop them.
O'NEILL
What about self-destruct?
CARTER
Right. Once it was set on Apophis' ship the bugs couldn't seem to
shut it off.
JACOB
Looks like the bugs have figured out Goa'uld computers. I can't get
into the main system.
[He turns away from the panel.]
O'NEILL
All right, come on, let's figure this out. We got them on Thor's
ship.
JACOB
How?
CARTER
We destroyed the deceleration drive just before the ship entered
Earth's atmosphere. It couldn't withstand an uncontrolled re-entry.
JACOB
Goa'uld motherships use sublight engines to slow down after exiting
hyperspace. If we destroy the sublight engine controls...
CARTER
The ship won't be able to stop.
JACOB
And it will crash right into Apophis' planet.
CARTER
Now we would have wait until just after the ship came out of
hyperspace, so the bugs won't have time to change trajectory.
O'NEILL
All right, how do we destroy these engines?
JACOB
All we have to do is eliminate the control crystals.
CARTER
In the engine room.
DANIEL
Which is bug central probably.
O'NEILL
So we plant c4.
CARTER
The bugs could disable the detonator by the time we leave and set it
off.
O'NEILL
What are you saying?
CARTER
To be sure, we would have to physically destroy the crystals
ourselves. A P90 at close range should do the job.
O'NEILL
Oh, now see, that doesn't sound like...
JACOB
You got a better idea, Mr Positive?
CARTER
This ship has now reached over eight hundred times its previous
maximum speed.
JACOB
All right, we'll be there pretty soon. One of us should get the
cargo ship charged up and ready to go.
O'NEILL
That would be you. Carter, Daniel, with me. They head down the
corridor.
JACOB
All right, it's going to be tight guys. You only have about 30
seconds to get from the engine room back to the cargo bay.
O'NEILL
Just keep it running.
JACOB
All right. Good luck.
[He runs off.]
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel enter the engine room. They stop when they
see something.]
O'NEILL
Oh, crap.
DANIEL
What the hell is that?
[A huge mass of pulsating replicators are attached to the engines,
forming one giant replicator.]
O'NEILL
That...is a big bug.
CARTER
Guess that explains the extra power.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Uh, listen. Let's not wake it up.
INT--CARGO SHIP, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob runs onto the ship and quickly takes the pilot's chair.]
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Carter edges forward, keeping one eye on the replicators.]
CARTER
Okay, control panels.
[She opens a panel to reveal a dozen crystals inside, then backs away.]
O'NEILL
Ready?
CARTER
Wait for it, Sir.
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership drops out of hyperspace and heads towards the planet
Delmak.]
INT--ENGINE ROOM, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[The engines die and O'Neill opens fire on the control panel,
destroying the crystals inside. The giant replicator rears up then
disassembles, scattering replicators everywhere. O'Neill, Carter and
Daniel start to run.]
O'NEILL
Go go go go go...
INT--CARGO SHIP, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Using the remote controls, Jacob opens the cargo bay doors.]
INT--CORRIDORS, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are retreating down the corridors, firing
on the replicators chasing them and barely managing to hold them off.]
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership is on a collision course for Delmak.]
INT--CORRIDORS, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[SG-1 continues to cover their retreat with firepower, but as they turn
a corridor, they are cut off by more replicators.]
CARTER
That's the way we have to go.
O'NEILL
Let's go!
[They rush the replicators, firing continuously to clear a path
through.]
INT--CARGO SHIP, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob pilots the cargo ship so that it is facing the doors.]
JACOB
(into his radio)
Guys, we got to go now. Jack, Sam, Daniel.
CARTER
(over radio)
Dad, we're cut off from the cargo bay. If we make it to the ring
room on level two, can you ring us up remotely?
JACOB
I'll try.
CARTER
Hurry!
[He presses the controls and rushes over to the cargo ship's ring room,
hearing the transporter. O'Neill, Carter and Daniel exit.]
CARTER
Thanks.
O'NEILL
Let's get out of here!
[Jacob takes the pilot's controls. Before them, the cargo bay doors
begin to slide shut.]
CARTER
The doors are closing.
JACOB
They've overridden our controls.
[He manoeuvres the ship towards the exit.]
CARTER
We going to make it?
JACOB
I don't want to say.
[The cargo ship exits the bay, catching one wing slightly in the
process, but leaving them otherwise undamaged.]
INT--BRIDGE, KRONOS' MOTHERSHIP
[Apophis is observing the ship's uncontrolled approach to Delmak on the
viewscreen. He has his shield up while replicators crawl over him,
unable to touch him. He starts to scream.]
INT--CARGO SHIP, SPACE
[On the viewscreen, they watch as Kronos' mothership hits the planet
and explodes in a huge flash of light. They all appear relieved.]
O'NEILL
I'm going to check on Teal'c.
[He heads towards the storage room.]
JACOB
Jack. You got his body back. Getting his mind back may not be as
easy.
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c is tied up, sitting with his back to the wall, eyes closed,
when O'Neill approaches. O'Neill crouches down before him.]
TEAL'C
You may torture me all you wish. I will tell you nothing.
O'NEILL
I'm sorry I had to shoot you, you didn't give me much choice though.
(When Teal'c doesn't respond)
Apophis is dead.
[Teal'c opens his eyes and stares at O'Neill.]
TEAL'C
I do not believe you.
O'NEILL
Trust me.
TEAL'C
Gods cannot be killed.
[Teal'c closes his eyes once more.]
FADE OUT
THE END
