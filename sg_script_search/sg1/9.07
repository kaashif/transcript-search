It's symbiote poison...
EXCERPT FROM 8.14 "FULL ALERT"
INT--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM
CARTER
The Trust launched at least two poison attacks against Goa'uld
occupied worlds after we took back the gate. That means they had to
leave the relatively safe confines of the solar system and head out
into the galaxy, where they ran the risk of being killed
or...captured.
CHEKOV
You think they have been taken as hosts, then sent back to Earth?
CARTER
Any Goa'uld who got his hands on them would have discovered pretty
quickly that they belonged to a top secret organization with high
level connections to some of the most powerful governments and
institutions on this planet. By now, the entire Trust could have
been taken over.

TEASER
EXT--WOODS, NIGHT
[A Jaffa in full armor runs through the woods. He stumbles and falls,
but gets back up and continues to run, clearly being chased by someone
or something. He reaches a road and is immediately struck by a pick-up
truck, which screeches to a stop. He falls off the hood and onto the
ground. Two men get out and stare at the fallen Jaffa in surprise.]
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry, Daniel, Mitchell and Teal'c sit at the table. Daniel passes
copies of 8x10 autopsy photographs of the dead Jaffa to the others.]
DANIEL
The body was discovered this morning in a remote road off Interstate
77 in Virginia. It was spotted by a passing motorist. Local
authorities say he'd been dead about a day or so, probably the
victim of a hit-and-run driver.
MITCHELL
So what do we figure, this guy got lost and he was, uh, hitching a
ride back to Chulak?
TEAL'C
His presence on Earth is a mystery to me.
DANIEL
He was found literally in the middle of nowhere, about three miles
north of a little town of Edison, population three thousand and
twelve.
[Daniel passes the rest of the report to Landry, who skims it.]
TEAL'C
The symbol on his forehead indicates that he was a servant of Lord
Yu, many of whom now follow Gerak.
LANDRY
Then Gerak might be able to shed some light on this.
TEAL'C
I will speak to him.
LANDRY
Very well. Colonel Mitchell, you're with Teal'c. Doctor Jackson, I
want you to dig up all the information you can on Edison, Virginia.
Colonel Carter will join you as soon as she's settled in.
[Landry gets up and leaves, while Mitchell stands at attention.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter pushes a dolly loaded with boxes down the hall. As she dodges a
maintenance worker, she loses control of the dolly for a moment.
Daniel, carrying a newspaper, sees her and moves to help.]
DANIEL
Whoa, Sam, hey, come on, let me, let me give you a hand.
[He takes control of the heavy dolly and moves it down the hall. Carter
walks next to him.]
CARTER
Thank you. So, uh, General Landry briefed me on the circumstances
surrounding our mystery Jaffa.
DANIEL
Yeah, I think I've got something on that.
[Daniel hands her the newspaper he has crumpled in his hand. It is a
copy of the Richmond Daily Tribune. The center headline is
"Farrow-Marshall shuts down Edison Plant." The photograph above the
headline shows the plant covered with the word "CLOSED" written in big
letters across it.]
CARTER
Farrow-Marshall?
DANIEL
Yeah, you, uh, familiar with them?
CARTER
They're an aeronautics firm headquartered in Bethesda. The
Department of Defense is their biggest client.
DANIEL
Yeah, turns out that their plant in Virginia employed about eight
hundred residents of Edison until it closed down six months ago.
Now, it's located just outside of town and about a mile and a half
from where our dead Jaffa turned up.
CARTER
Really?
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Daniel and Carter enter her lab and Daniel sets the dolly upright.
Boxes, metal cases, and equipment are scattered throughout the room.]
CARTER
Ah...pardon the mess. I'm still unpacking.
[She moves to her computer and starts typing. Daniel comes up behind
her, reading the monitor screen over her shoulder.]
CARTER
Uh...Farrow-Marshall. Let's see what they've been up to recently.
[Carter does a web search on "Intersearcher" and chooses an article. A
screen pops up with a head shot photograph captioned "Alex Jameson,
Vice President, Farrow-Marshall." The headline of the article reads
"Farrow-Marshalll executive, Alex Jameson still missing."]
CARTER
Here we go. Their chief financial officer went missing yesterday
morning.
DANIEL
Interesting timing.
CARTER
Yeah. According to his wife, he left for a business meeting in
Richmond, Virginia and never came back.
EXT--DAKARA, DAY
INT--DAKARA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER
[Jaffa council members sit at two curved tables that form a
semi-circle. A small circular platform is on the floor between the two
tables. Gerak stands on this platform giving a speech to the council.]
GERAK
Make no mistake, brothers, the Tok'ra only wish to meet with us
because they fear us. We defeated the Goa'uld and took their mother
ships and strongholds. Now, we are our own masters.
KA'LEL
(standing)
I needn't remind the council that the Tok'ra did battle with the
Goa'uld for just as many years. Their efforts were instrumental in
securing our freedom.
GERAK
Let us all be clear. The only motivation that the Tok'ra have is
their own selfish needs, not to help any of us.
[Mitchell and Teal'c, the latter wearing Jaffa robes, enter the chamber
behind Gerak. Ka'lel takes her seat. Teal'c heads down the staircase
towards the center of the room as he begins to speak.]
TEAL'C
(smirking)
Then what do you suggest, Gerak? That we use our newfound strength
to take what we want? That we emulate our former oppressors?
Brothers and sisters, we finally have the opportunity to govern with
authority and respect. Years ago, that seemed unthinkable. But now,
we are in a position to help others who are in need of our support
and guidance.
GERAK
Why should we help them?
[Teal'c opens his mouth to respond, but Mitchell interjects.]
MITCHELL
How about because it is the right thing to do?
[Gerak grimaces at Mitchell as he makes his way down the stairs. Teal'c
gauges the reactions of the other council members.]
MITCHELL
(continuing)
Look, whatever your differences with the Tok'ra in the past, it's
time to move on. Teal'c's right. You kicked ass; you're sitting
pretty. Don't get hung up on--
[Teal'c interrupts Mitchell's momentum by stretching out his left arm,
catching Mitchell across the chest.]
TEAL'C
(muttering to Mitchell)
Outsiders are not permitted to address the council.
MITCHELL
(chastised)
Never mind.
GERAK
I caution you all, we have fought too long and too hard to entrust
our future to the Tok'ra, or the Tau'ri for that matter.
KA'LEL
(standing)
Brothers and sisters, I suggest we bring this assembly to an end.
Let us consider what we've discussed, and reconvene in the morning.
GERAK
Very well.
[Gerak raises his arm as a signal to adjourn, and the council members
stand and leave the chamber. Ka'lel and Teal'c exchange respectful nods
before she leaves. Gerak heads towards the staircase. Teal'c stops him
as he passes by.]
TEAL'C
Gerak, a word.
[Gerak takes Teal'c by the arm and leads him a little further away from
Mitchell.]
GERAK
(chuckling with insincere pleasure)
Teal'c, welcome back to Dakara. Your presence is sorely missed.
What, uh...draws you away from your Tau'ri home?
TEAL'C
A Jaffa was discovered on Earth...dead.
GERAK
Oh, strange. But, uh, what has that got to do with me?
TEAL'C
He was a servant of Lord Yu's, and I assumed a follower of yours.
[Mitchell holds up a photograph for Gerak to see. After a few moments,
he takes the photo.]
GERAK
Well, that may be, but, uh, I don't seem to recognize him. Nor...do
I know what he's doing on Earth.
[An aide comes up and whispers something in Gerak's ear.]
GERAK
My obligation to the Council requires my presence elsewhere. I'm
sure you understand.
[He gives the picture back to Teal'c with a glare and follows his aide.
Mitchell and Teal'c watch him leave.]
TEAL'C
He is lying to us.
MITCHELL
No kidding.
INT--COFFEE SHOP, BETHESDA, MARYLAND REGION
[Daniel, in civilian garb, carries two cups of coffee through a crowded
restaurant, grabbing a creamer before sitting in a booth with Sheila
Jameson.]
SHEILA JAMESON
It was about six months ago when he started acting strangely.
[Daniel pours cream into his coffee.]
DANIEL
What do you mean, "strangely"?
SHEILA JAMESON
Cold. Distant. You've gotta understand, Alex has always been
incredibly focused when it comes to his job. And at first I just
assumed he had a lot on his plate. But after a couple of weeks, it
became clear that it was more than that. I started to suspect he
might be having an affair...so I hired a private investigator, and I
had him followed.
DANIEL
And...what did the investigator find out?
SHEILA JAMESON
I'm not sure, exactly, but a couple of days after accepting the job,
he quit, returned all of my money and strongly suggested that I drop
the matter.
DANIEL
He didn't offer you any kind of explanation?
SHEILA JAMESON
No, but it was obvious he was scared. He did some surveillance in
his first two days. These are the photos that he took.
[She hands Daniel an envelope full of black and white 8x10 photographs
of various men. Daniel flips through them as Jameson continues
talking.]
SHEILA JAMESON
He asked for them back after a couple of days, uh, after he dropped
the case, but I refused. I offered them to the police, but they
didn't think the photos were pertinent to their investigation. My
husband wasn't having an affair, but he was clearly involved in
something that he wanted to keep secret.
DANIEL
Do you mind if we hold on to these?
SHEILA JAMESON
No, go ahead.
[Daniel studies a photograph of Alex Jameson standing by a car.]
INT--DAKARA DUNGEON
[Yat'yir looks contemptuously at someone chained by bloody wrists from
the ceiling. Gerak and two Jaffa enter the room.]
GERAK
He still refuses to speak?
YAT'YIR
The prisoner is strong.
GERAK
Then we must be stronger, Yat'yir.
[Gerak reaches back to one of the other Jaffa and grabs a pain stick.
He activates it to check the charge. Yat'yir looks at him in surprise.]
YAT'YIR
It was through instruments like this, we were oppressed.
GERAK
Then, how appropriate would it be then, for it to be used to serve
our cause.
[He approaches the prisoner, who is Alex Jameson. The man's face is
bruised and bloodied, the dress shirt he wears, disheveled.]
GERAK
(holding the pain stick up the Jameson's face)
You will surrender your secrets. Of that, I am sure.
[Jameson's eyes glow. He is a Goa'uld.]
EXT--FARROW-MARSHALL HEADQUARTERS, BETHESDA, MD, DAY
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM, F-M HEADQUARTERS
[Carter paces a conference room in her class A uniform. Mayfield enters
the conference room and greets her.]
MAYFIELD
Colonel Carter? Charlotte Mayfield, V.P. here at Farrow-Marshall.
How can I help you?
[They shake hands, and Mayfield motions for Carter to sit.]
CARTER
I wanted to ask you a few questions about your plant in Virginia.
MAYFIELD
It was shut down six months ago.
CARTER
Officially, yes. But we went by to check it out, and it looked like
it had been cleaned out very recently.
MAYFIELD
I'm not sure what you're getting at.
CARTER
Some of the residents of Edison claim they saw trucks traveling to
and from the plant a couple of nights ago.
MAYFIELD
They're mistaken.
CARTER
So you're saying no one's been in the area for several months?
MAYFIELD
(smiling insincerely)
Well, I can't speak for the locals, but certainly no one from
Farrow-Marshall would have any reason to go there.
CARTER
How about Richmond?
[Mayfield shakes her head slightly with a blank look on her face.]
CARTER
(copying Mayfield's fake smile)
Anyone from Farrow-Marshall have reason to go there?
(Mayfield blinks)
According to his wife, Alex Jameson was on his way to Richmond,
Virginia when he went missing.
MAYFIELD
We've cooperated with the local authorities on Mr. Jameson's
disappearance. You may want to consult with them.
CARTER
Who was Mr. Jameson meeting with that day?
MAYFIELD
I'm sorry. Company policy prevents me from discussing that with you.
CARTER
Your CFO is missing. Now I would think that you would want to do
everything within your power to help find him.
MAYFIELD
Oh, I do. As I said, we're cooperating with the authorities. Now if
you'll excuse me, I-I think we're done here.
[She walks to the door, and two large security men appear.]
MAYFIELD
These gentlemen will show you out. If you have any further
questions, feel free to fax them to the head office.
[The security forces enter the room as Carter stands.]
INT--SECURITY ROOM, F-M HEADQUARTERS
[Mayfield enters the security room and watches a monitor which shows
Carter and her security escort leaving the building.]
MAYFIELD
You can be sure that's not the end of it.

BA'AL
Of course not. We've only just...begun.
[Ba'al's eyes glow.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Daniel and Landry walk through a corridor on Level Three. Daniel
passes some photographs from a file to Landry.]
DANIEL
Now, I coordinated with Kerry Johnson in the CIA's investigation
into the NID/Trust connection. We've done a little digging, and
managed to put names to some of the faces from the photographs
Sheila Jameson provided. That's David Ballard, chairman of the Stark
Consortium. This is Masato Hiro, CEO, Far East Mercantile. James
Lowery and Tony Tran, president and Chief Financial Officer, Alaraph
Pharmaceuticals...
[They enter the elevator.]
DANIEL
(continuing)
This one is Michael Northrup, CEO, founder of Hammel Technologies.
Now all the individuals we've managed to identify so far are major
players in the areas of business and high finance. Very powerful,
very influential, and in the case of these two...very missing.
LANDRY
Missing?
DANIEL
Terrance Evans and William Blaylock, founding partners of Procyon
Media Enterprises. They went missing about six months ago,
coincidentally around the same time we managed to destroy the Osiris
ship.
[They get out of the elevator on Level Twenty-Eight.]
LANDRY
You see a possible Goa'uld connection here?
DANIEL
Well, we already know that sometime last year, the Goa'uld
successfully infiltrated the Trust. Now I know that the Trust has
connections to government agencies and corporations worldwide.
There's a good chance we didn't get them all. If that's case, the
Goa'uld are still on Earth, and they're gaining strength.
EXT--DAKARA, DAY
INT--DAKARA COUNCIL CORRIDORS
[Mitchell waits while Teal'c speaks to two Jaffa. After a few moments,
they bow to each other and part ways. Teal'c heads back to Mitchell,
looking frustrated.]
MITCHELL
Let me guess, they didn't know anything either.
TEAL'C
As Gerak grows stronger, fewer Jaffa risk defying him for fear of
retribution. We must leave Dakara and seek our answers elsewhere.
KA'LEL
The answers you seek are on Earth.
[Mitchell and Teal'c see Ka'lel standing hidden in an alcove. They
approach her.]
TEAL'C
What do you know of the Jaffa we discovered?
KA'LEL
He lost his life trying to secure Gerak's prize.
TEAL'C
Of what prize do you speak?
KA'LEL
Ba'al.
MITCHELL
Ba'al is on Earth?
KA'LEL
That is where he sought refuge immediately following his defeat in
the Battle for Dakara. He has been there ever since.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry, Daniel, Carter, Mitchell, and Teal'c enter the control room
from the spiral staircase.]
LANDRY
You're telling me a member of the Jaffa High Council claims that
Ba'al has been here on Earth for the better part of the last nine
months?
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
Is there any chance she may be right?
TEAL'C
My information suggests that Ba'al has been hiding in the Archeva
system. He has been sighted there as recently as a week ago.
LANDRY
So the council member is either lying or she's a victim of bad
intelligence.
CARTER
Not all bad, sir. They knew enough to look for Ba'al at a
Trust-operated facility. If he were on Earth, that would be the best
place to start.
TEAL'C
If the Jaffa genuinely believe Ba'al to be on Earth, they will
continue to search for him.
LANDRY
Well, that's obviously unacceptable. Tell the council we've begun
our own investigation. If he's here, we'll find him.
TEAL'C
It would not be in Gerak's best interest to allow that to happen.
LANDRY
Why?
DANIEL
Ba'al's capture would be a big moral victory as well as a huge
political gain for whoever brings him in.
TEAL'C
Should Gerak be successful, he would win the hearts of many
undecided Jaffa, thereby assuring undisputed influence over the
council.
MITCHELL
So all we have to do is find Ba'al before they do.
CARTER
Yeah, but Gerak has a head start. The fact that the company's CFO
went missing around the same time that the Jaffa was killed...
LANDRY
You think Jameson was at the plant when they came looking for Ba'al?
CARTER
In which case, he may well have been captured.
INT--DAKARA DUNGEON
[Gerak enters the dungeon. Yat'yir crouches on the floor next to the
prisoner. The chains shackling Jameson to the ceiling have been
slackened so that he mostly lies on the floor. Jameson's arms remain
stretched over his head, and his shirt has been cut away and discarded,
leaving him in a bloody undershirt. He is practically unconscious.]
YAT'YIR
He has revealed Ba'al's location, and the locations of his various
shelters on Earth.
[Yat'yir, disgusted, drops the pain stick, and it clatters to the
floor.]
GERAK
You should never have invented such an effective means of torture.
[Yat'yir looks at Gerak. Jameson's head lolls back.]
EXT--CITYSCAPE, BETHESDA, MD, NIGHT

Several Jaffa exit the ship and move in attack formations across the

online poker.]
EMPLOYEE

[He wins the game, and music plays over the speakers.]
EMPLOYEE
(lifting his fists in triumph)
Yes!
[Behind him, Yat'yir aims and primes his staff weapon. The employee
turns at the sound and stares at Yat'yir and two other Jaffa,
petrified.]

When one passes a hallway, he gets shot by a Jaffa staff blast.
Security instantly returns fire.]
[Yat'yir and his escort hear the weapons' fire. Yat'yir stops aiming
his weapon at the employee, and he and the other two leave to join the
fight. The employee stays in his seat, staring in shock.]
[Heavy fire from both Jaffa and Ba'al's security are exchanged among
the cubicles, various Jaffa and humans are wounded and/or killed, and a
lot of equipment is destroyed.]

blasts shoot overhead, he has the handset of his desk telephone and is
trying to overcome his panic and speak into the phone.]

Hello? Hello? Ah...I'd like to report...Ah...ah...ah...A whole lot

EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[On Level 27, Mitchell leans against a wall and checks his watch. The
elevator doors open and Daniel step out. They walk down the hall
together.]
MITCHELL
So?
DANIEL
Those offices were a war zone. Staff weapons versus semi-automatics.
MITCHELL
Who won?
DANIEL
Hard to say. There was no bodies and all the security footage was
missing.
MITCHELL
Witnesses?
DANIEL
One. Some guy who was working overtime, spent most of the firefight
under his desk, but was able to provide the descriptions of three
individuals: big, tattooed, chain mail pants.
MITCHELL
So it's either our Jaffa, or KISS is back on tour.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry is already waiting when Daniel and Mitchell enter the room.
Harriman finishes setting up a television set in the room and hands
Landry the remote.]
LANDRY
I have something to show you. We've just received this.
[Landry starts to play a videotape. Ba'al appears on the screen.]
BA'AL
(onscreen)
Although it's a far cry from some of the better worlds I've
conquered in my days, this planet is not without it's charms.
MITCHELL
(to Daniel)
That's...?
DANIEL
(quietly)
Ba'al.
[The three watch the video with mounting suspicion and skepticism.]
BA'AL
(continuing)
In retrospect, I'm actually glad we never succeeded in destroying
it. That said, Earth is not without its drawbacks. The foremost
being an alarming lack of privacy. My ships have been seized, my
armies vanquished. I no longer present a threat to this galaxy. All
I ask is to be left alone without having to worry about you, the
Jaffa, or any of my former enemies coming after me, so...I'd like to
offer the following deal--allow me to live out the rest of my days
here on Earth in peace, without interference. In exchange for my,
uh...freedom, I will follow your laws. You will never have cause to
fear me again. I hope we can put the past behind us. I...certainly
have no desire to harm you or anyone else on this world.
That said, you should know that I've placed a naquadah bomb
somewhere in the United States. Consider it a...uh...precautionary
measure. If another attempt is made to capture me, I promise you,
the consequences will be most dire.
[Landry stops the tape and looks at Mitchell and Daniel, their
skepticism replaced with concern.]
[Some time later...]
[Carter hangs up a telephone and moves to the briefing table where
Daniel, Teal'c, Landry and Mitchell are already seated. Carter takes a
seat.]
MITCHELL
Of all the retirement destinations he could choose, he has to pick
OUR planet?
CARTER
We have teams outfitted with naquadah detectors in several major
urban centers, but there's no way we can cover the whole country.
TEAL'C
The Prometheus has instruments which can detect naquadah from orbit,
does it not?
CARTER
Yes, but so far, the scans have come up empty.
LANDRY
So it could be a bluff?
CARTER
Or Ba'al may have found a way to shield the bomb from our sensors.
DANIEL
Bluffing or not, he's still a threat. As de facto head of the Trust
operations, he has the resources and capabilities to do a lot of
damage, naquadah bomb or not.
MITCHELL
So, problem number one: how do we find him? Problem number two: how
do we take him out without inflicting collateral damage?
DANIEL
Ah, good point. Ba'al's probably surrounded by security, no doubt
most of them human, with no knowledge of his true identity. If we go
after him, we risk injuring innocent people.
CARTER
Not if we use the symbiote poison the Tok'ra developed. We already
know it won't harm human physiology.
MITCHELL
And with the right delivery system, nothing but net. Nice.
CARTER
I'll contact R&D, see what they can put together.
LANDRY
Which leaves us with problem number one.
DANIEL
The NID's running surveillance on the individuals identified in the
photographs with Jameson. Hopefully, eventually one of them will
lead us to Ba'al.
TEAL'C
Of equal concern are Gerak's Jaffa. We have no control over them. If
they decide to move on Ba'al, Earth will face Ba'al's full reprisal.
MITCHELL
And I'm guessing, those Jaffa aren't exactly kickin' it back at the
local Denny's. Plus, isn't it a long, stinky ride from Dakara in a
cargo ship?
TEAL'C
Indeed. It is more likely that Gerak has a mother ship somewhere in
the vicinity of Earth.
CARTER
Well, if the Prometheus was going to detect the naquadah from orbit,
it would have done it by now.
LANDRY
All right, I'll send them out to look for the mother ship. Colonel
Mitchell, I want you and Teal'c on board. Colonel Carter, Doctor
Jackson, you coordinate with the NID. In the event they locate
Ba'al, I want you there.
[Landry leaves the room, and everyone stands. Daniel, Carter and Teal'c
start to leave the room. Mitchell reaches into a pocket and takes out
something.]
MITCHELL
Hey, wait up!
[The three stop and look at him. Daniel and Carter stand next to each
other in front of Mitchell. Teal'c stands to one side. Without asking,
Mitchell rips Daniel's SGC patch off its velcroed spot on his right
shoulder and replaces it with an SG-1 patch. Daniel pulls his sleeve
forward to look at the new patch. Mitchell next moves to Carter and
holds the patch in front of her face. With a small smile, she nods, and
he replaces her patch as well. Finally he turns to Teal'c, offering him
the final SG-1 patch. After pausing for a long moment, Teal'c bows and
takes the patch from Mitchell's hand.]
MITCHELL
(with satisfied smile and nod)
All right, that's better.
[Mitchell leaves the room. Daniel and Carter share amused, but pleased
smiles. From his office desk, Landry watches these events through his
window and nods.]

MITCHELL
Thank you, sir. Any word from NORAD?
PENDERGAST
SSN came up empty. Could the ship we're looking for be cloaked?
TEAL'C
Mother ships do not possess cloaking capabilities.
PENDERGAST
Well, then could we be looking for another type of craft?
TEAL'C
It is possible.
PENDERGAST
Whatever the target ship, if it's out there, we'll find it.

DANIEL

BARRETT

Well, I couldn't exactly have you guys catching a cab to the
stakeout, now, could I?
CARTER
So, what's the latest?
BARRETT
Well, one of our agents following the Jameson leads spotted an
individual matching Ba'al's description at the Gilbride Hotel on
Fifth Street about an hour ago. Looks like we got him.

readings?
MARKS
No, sir.
MITCHELL
(to Teal'c)
You know, it's possible what we're looking for isn't even out there.
TEAL'C
It is possible, but unlikely. If Gerak believed Ba'al to be on
Earth, he would undoubtably establish a base of operations in
planetary orbit.
MITCHELL
Great, so where is it?
[Teal'c stares out the window looking at Earth's moon for several
seconds.]
TEAL'C
(thinking out loud)
Hiding in plain sight.
[Mitchell hears him and realizes his meaning.]
PENDERGAST
What was that?
MITCHELL
(nodding)
Right.
TEAL'C
Mmm. Colonel Pendergast, plot a course for the far side of the moon.
PENDERGAST
Do it.
EXT--PARKING LOT ACROSS FROM GILBRIDE HOTEL, MD/VA/DC REGION, DAY
[The surveillance van pulls into an outdoor parking lot, and Williams
jogs towards it, entering.]
BARRETT
What's the situation?
WILLIAMS
They're still inside, Room 1602. All the exits are covered. We're
just waiting for the green light.
BARRETT
Dr. Jackson, you go with Williams.
[Daniel gets up and stores a weapon in his waistband under his jacket.
Williams checks his gun and re-holsters it. They both exit the van.
Carter moves over to where Daniel was and turns on some equipment.
There is a long silence.]
BARRETT
(clearing throat)
How've you been?
CARTER
Pretty good. You?
BARRETT
Yeah, pretty good...can't complain.
[They smile awkwardly at each other and there is a silence as Carter
checks other equipment.]
BARRETT
What's new?
CARTER
Uh, let's see...I was leading R&D for a while there.
BARRETT
Well, I never figured you the type to settle for a desk job.
CARTER
I needed something with more flexible hours. Janet's adopted
daughter, Cassie, was going through a hard time.
BARRETT
Oh, I see.
CARTER
Spent some time on the Prometheus, away on deep space
reconnaissance.
BARRETT
Uh-huh.
CARTER
(brightening)
Ooo. Helped stop a dangerous new enemy from gaining a foothold in
the galaxy.
BARRETT
Yes, I heard about that...How's Pete?
CARTER
(pausing)
We broke up.
BARRETT
(smiling)
Really?
[When Carter looks over, he tries to school his face into a more
sympathetic expression.]
BARRETT
Uh...I mean, I'm sorry to hear that.
CARTER
(shrugging)
Oh, it was the best thing for both of us.
BARRETT
(after a pause)
So, you're single again?
CARTER
Not exactly.
[There is another awkward silence as they exchange looks.]
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus approaches Earth's moon and starts to orbit it to the far
side.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
MARKS
Sir, I'm picking up a large energy signature.
[Through the window, a hat'ak vessel appears stationed on the other
side of the moon.]
PENDERGAST
Lock on target.
MARKS
Target locked. Sir, we're receiving a communication from the mother
ship.
PENDERGAST
Let's see it.
[Pendergast turns to a side screen and Mitchell and Teal'c approach the
screen. Yat'yir appears on the video communication link.]
YAT'YIR
(over videolink)
Withdraw, or we will be forced to defend ourselves.
MITCHELL
Sorry. We're not going anywhere.
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus and the ha'tak vessel face each other in orbit around
Earth's moon.]
EXT--PARKING LOT ACROSS FROM GILBRIDE HOTEL, MD/VA/DC REGION, DAY
[Williams and Daniel watch the hotel from a car, looking through
binoculars to monitor the room and front entrance.]
DANIEL
Come on, where are they?
BARRETT
(over radio)
Abort. All agents, abort.
DANIEL
(into radio)
What's going on?
BARRETT
(over radio)
He's not inside. If we move now, we risk compromising the operation.
[Daniel spots something and again looks through his binoculars. Through
them, he sees a limousine pull up and a man that looks like Ba'al
enters the limo with his security.]
DANIEL
(into radio)
Barrett, you'd better be damn sure about this.
BARRETT
(over radio)
We're sure. Let them go, and come to the van.
[Daniel shakes his head. Williams puts his binoculars down and sighs.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Daniel enters the van. Barrett is on a cell phone.]
DANIEL
Sam?
CARTER
It wasn't him.
DANIEL
How do you know?
CARTER
Because he can't be in two places at once. Ba'al is across town
right now doing a live television interview.
DANIEL
What?
[Carter turns on a television. Ba'al appears on-screen behind a podium,
holding a press conference.]
BA'AL
(on television)
Thank you, that's a very good question. My acquisition of Hammel
Technologies and its subsidiaries is just a first step in a
long-range venture that will ultimately see a-a consolidation and
a-a streamlining of what is presently a dissolute market. No doubt,
most of you have never heard of me before today. Well, I can assure
you that over the next few months, you will all get to know me very
well, and I look forward to it.
[Carter turns off the set, clenching her jaw. Daniel rolls his eyes in
frustration.]
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus and the ha'tak vessel face each other.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
PENDERGAST
(to Yat'yir)
This is Colonel Pendergast of the Earth ship, Prometheus, asking you
to stand down.
YAT'YIR
(over videolink)
We have no desire to engage in battle, but we will not withdraw our
forces.
MITCHELL
Look, we know why you're here.
YAT'YIR
Then you also know that I have no choice but to maintain my present
position.
MITCHELL
Okay, FYI, we're not going to let you put any more men on the
planet's surface.
YAT'YIR
If you fire on our ship, we will defend ourselves.
TEAL'C
Yat'yir, hear me. You and your Jaffa are at a disadvantage, knowing
neither territory, nor its inhabitants. Allow us to assist you in
apprehending Ba'al. We can both lay claim to his capture. Then all
Jaffa can declare freedom and celebrate as one.
YAT'YIR
I am afraid we are past the point where our differences can be
settled so readily. I am sorry, Teal'c.
[The communication cuts off.]
MITCHELL
(grimacing)
Guh. Meanwhile, they still got boots on the ground.
PENDERGAST
Nothing we can do about that.
TEAL'C
Perhaps we can.
MITCHELL
Can how?
TEAL'C
(with a grim smile)
By forcing Gerak's hand.
[Teal'c leaves the bridge. After a moment, Mitchell follows.]
EXT--CITY STREET, UNKNOWN TOWN, MD/VA/DC REGION, DAY
[The surveillance van is parked at the curb of a busy city street.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
CARTER
(on cell phone)
Yes, sir.
(She closes the phone)
Our orders are to stay put for the time being.
BARRETT
You've got to be kidding me. Come on, we know where he is. We've got
him.
CARTER
Yes, Ba'al has made it easier for us to pinpoint his location. But
unfortunately, by going public, he's made it more difficult for us
to take him down quickly and covertly. We make a move against him
now, and we risk a media circus. Unless, of course, you feel like
giving the American people a Stargate primer.
DANIEL
There's also the little matter of a naquadah bomb sitting somewhere
in the continental United States.
BARRETT
Yeah, okay, okay. We'll stay.
CARTER
The General's consulting with the Pentagon to determine what our
next move should be.
INT--DAKARA COUNCIL CORRIDOR
[Teal'c, wearing Jaffa robes, is walking down a narrow corridor with
Mitchell by his side.]
TEAL'C
If there is one thing a Jaffa values above all else, it is his
pride. When the other council members discover that Gerak has not
been completely forthcoming, they will turn against him and force
his hand. Gerak must be shamed into removing his forces from Earth.
It is the only way.
MITCHELL
Your turf, your rules, brother.
INT--DAKARA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER
[Teal'c enters through a side door to the chamber and stands by an
empty chair. Across the room, Gerak sits at the other table, speaking
to the council. Mitchell stands by the door.]
GERAK
No matter how far we must travel, no matter how long it will take,
our former enemies must pay for their crimes. This I promise
you--that we will destroy them. Not only just in memory of those who
have fallen, but in honor of those who survived to enjoy their
freedom.
TEAL'C
You speak of honor, Gerak, yet you disrespect this council by
dishonoring it with your lies.
GERAK
I have not lied to this council. It is you that I have purposely
misled, for fear that your commitment to the cause is suspect.
TEAL'C
Even as we speak, Gerak's followers are hunting Ba'al on Earth.
KA'LEL
Of this we are well aware.
[Teal'c and Mitchell glance at Ka'lel in surprise. Ka'lel looks down.]
GERAK
I had wished to inform the council sooner, but I dared not, for fear
that the elements who are sympathetic to the Tau'ri would learn
about Ba'al's whereabouts.
TEAL'C
(angry)
You dare question my loyalty?
KA'LEL
Your loyalty is not under question, Teal'c. You have done more than
anyone to help secure our freedom, and for that we are ever
grateful. However, your allegiance to the Tau'ri presents you with a
difficult dilemma.
GERAK
Even as we speak, your Tau'ri ships prevent us from pursuing the
enemy.
TEAL'C
(pauses, and thinks for a moment)
As you have said, Ka'lel, I accomplished much in our long struggle
against our former oppressors, but only because of the support of
the Tau'ri. Their commitment was as unwavering as my own. And now
you would repay them by surreptitiously stealing upon their world,
putting their people to say NOTHING of the Stargate Program at risk!
They are our allies. Rather than dishonor them by trespassing onto
their world, respect them enough to tell them the truth! Ask for
their assistance in capturing Ba'al. They will help us!
GERAK
But, uh...will they?
TEAL'C
They are as determined to have Ba'al answer for his crimes as are
we.
GERAK
But if THEY succeed?
TEAL'C
Then he will be brought before this council, where he will face his
proper punishment! You have my word.
[Gerak gives Teal'c a shrewd look. Mitchell looks concerned and follows
Teal'c out of the chamber.]
INT--DAKARA COUNCIL CORRIDOR
MITCHELL
What the hell are you thinking? There ain't no guarantee the U.S.
government is gonna give them Ba'al.
TEAL'C
It was only to give Gerak pause before his next attack against Ba'al
on Earth. Even so, we may have only gained a brief respite.
EXT--WORMHOLE PASSAGE
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Siler and another man carry ammunition boxes down the hall. As they
pass the open doorway to the gate room, Landry greets Mitchell and
Teal'c at the base of the ramp. They enter the corridor and walk
towards the control room stairwell.]
LANDRY
Satellite tracking has placed Ba'al in a remote, heavily guarded
compound west of the city. From the site of the press conference,
directly to his present location, he took no evasive maneuvers, made
absolutely no attempt to disguise his movements.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOOM
[Landry, Mitchell and Teal'c walk up the staircase. Daniel and Carter
are visible on a communication link on the monitors overhead.]
TEAL'C
Clearly, he is emboldened by the belief that you would not dare
attack him now that he has made himself a public figure.
LANDRY
I've had Walter patch in Col. Carter and Dr. Jackson.
(to overhead monitor)
Everybody up to date?
CARTER
(over videolink)
We have a cruise missile prepped with symbiote poison and ready to
launch on your command.
MITCHELL
General, I recommend we launch now. It may be the last chance we
get.
DANIEL
(over videolink)
What if he isn't bluffing about the naquadah bomb?
MITCHELL
Then we'll have stopped him before he has the chance to plant any
more.
CARTER
We'll have to come up with a cover story.
MITCHELL
Wouldn't be the first time.
TEAL'C
We must strike now before Ba'al realizes his strategy has backfired.
LANDRY
And the council?
TEAL'C
(smiling)
I merely promised he would be delivered if captured. If he is
killed, then there is no difficulty.
EXT--BA'AL'S COMPOUND, MD/VA/DC REGION, DAY
INT--CONTROL ROOM, BA'AL'S COMPOUND
[Personnel are stationed at various monitors. Mayfield stands talking
on a phone. Ba'al enters the room.]
MAYFIELD
(on phone)
Right, good work.
[She hangs up the phone.]
BA'AL
What's the news?
MAYFIELD
Stargate command intends to attack.
BA'AL
How can you be certain?
MAYFIELD
The humans that set up the Trust were in a position to infiltrate
much of the secured communications network employed by this
government.
BA'AL
(smiling)
How clever of them.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry, Mitchell, and Teal'c are seated in Landry's office. Walter
sets up the television screen in the briefing room. Landry and Mitchell
spot him through the window, and all three enter the room.]
LANDRY
You got something else for me, Walter?
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir. We just got this sent to us.
[Harriman presses the remote, and a video of Ba'al begins to play.]
BA'AL
You have chosen not to heed my warning and so have forced my hand.
There is a bomb in the Halcyon Tower in downtown Seattle. It will
detonate at exactly 1:30 p.m. local time. Call off your strike on my
location, and I will diffuse the device. Defy me, and this will be
just the first of many such demonstrations.
LANDRY
(looking at watch)
Forty-five minutes.
HARRIMAN
The building's being evacuated. Mobile units have been dispatched.
EXT--ROAD, MD/VA/DC REGION, DAY
[The surveillance van heads up a rural road.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Daniel and Barrett grip secured shelves as the van bounces along the
road. Carter is on her cell phone.]
CARTER
Yes, sir. Understood, sir.
(she hangs up the phone and grabs onto some equipment for balance)
Agent Barrett, have your men tighten their perimeter around the
compound. No one in or out. Daniel, once the missile hits, you'll
have to go in and make sure we have a confirmed kill.
DANIEL
Why, where are you going to be?
CARTER
Seattle.
BARRETT
How the hell are you going to get there?
[Carter smiles and is beamed out of the van via an Asgard transport
beam.]
BARRETT
Prometheus.
DANIEL
Beats flying coach.
EXT--HALCYON TOWER, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, DAY
[Sirens wail by the skyscraper.]
INT--HALCYON TOWER LOBBY AND PROMENADE
[Soldiers dressed in all black gear direct people out of the building.
On the second story promenade overlooking the lobby, soldiers run
scanning equipment along the walls. A transport beam activates and
Carter, her arm still raised as if holding onto the van equipment,
appears. One soldier notices her and approaches, holding out his
reading results.]
SOLDIER
Colonel Carter.
CARTER
(looking at readings)
Have you located the bomb?
SOLDIER
We're unable to get a fix on its location.
[He continues to scan a wall, Carter watching the results.]
CARTER
Multiple signals. Is it possible there's more than one device?
SOLDIER
Well, we're not sure.
EXT--BA'AL'S COMPOUND, DAY
[A Jaffa cargo ship lands on the roof of the building.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM, BA'AL'S COMPOUND
BA'AL
Wipe the hard drives and destroy the equipment. I want nothing left.
[Staff weapons fire is heard in the distance.]
MAYFIELD
The Jaffa! They've found us.
BA'AL
Time to go.
[Mayfield and Ba'al leave, followed by security guards wearing kevlar
vests.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Harriman enters the room and resumes his station.]
HARRIMAN
Colonel Carter and her team are still searching. No sign of the bomb
yet.
[Landry, Mitchell and Teal'c approach. All the monitor screens in the
room show a countdown until the detonation of Ba'al's naquadah bomb.]
HARRIMAN
(listening on earpiece)
Sir, Dr. Jackson reports Jaffa at the target site. They've engaged
the compound guards.
[Landry turns to Teal'c with a serious look on his face.]
TEAL'C
(in a soft voice)
We must not hesitate, General Landry.
[Landry turns to Mitchell, who gives a curt nod.]
LANDRY
Launch the missile.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir. Launching Alpha Two.
INT--HALCYON TOWER
[Carter and other soldiers scan an office.]
SOLDIER
It doesn't make any sense. It's like there's naquadah everywhere.
[Carter looks up with a strange expression on her face.]
CARTER
How old is this building?
AGENT
It's brand-new. It just went up last month.
CARTER
Get me a secure line to Stargate Command. Now.
[The soldier moves away and Carter looks around the room with a worried
expression.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HARRIMAN
Sir, I've got Colonel Carter.
LANDRY
Colonel, did you find the bomb?
CARTER
(over speaker phone)
Sort of.
LANDRY
What's that supposed to mean?
INT--HALCYON TOWER
CARTER
(into phone)
Readings indicate the entire superstructure of the building is laced
with naquadah. It was built that way. Ba'al's been planning this for
a long time.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LANDRY
I'm not sure I understand, Colonel.
INT--HALCYON TOWER
CARTER
The bomb isn't IN the building, sir. The bomb IS the building.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry's face falls, and he looks at Teal'c and Mitchell. Behind them,
the monitors countdown to four minutes, thirty seconds before
detonation.]
[A few minutes later...]
[Harriman's screen gives radar analysis of an object moving to the
center of the screen. When it reaches the center, a caption blinks in
red letters, "TARGET HIT".]
HARRIMAN
Missile is locked on.
(listening to earpiece)
Sir, we have a confirmed hit on the location. Agent Barrett and his
team are moving in to secure the area.
[Landry, Mitchell, and Teal'c look at each other and wait. The
countdown continues to one minute forty seconds.]
MITCHELL
Sam, that naquadah ain't going to go up on its own. There's got to
be a detonator there.
INT--HALCYON TOWER LOBBY
CARTER
I agree, but it could be anywhere--inside a wall, under a floor.
We'd never find it in time.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LANDRY
How much progress have you made on the evacuation?
INT--HALCYON TOWER LOBBY
CARTER
We've cleared a five block radius, but when this thing goes off, a
five MILE radius isn't going to be enough.
LANDRY
(over phone)
There's not much you can do about that now...
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LANDRY
(continuing)
I'll contact Prometheus, have them beam you and your team out of
there.
MITCHELL
Wait, that's it. Prometheus...
(moves to Harriman)
Sergeant!
HARRIMAN
Sir.
MITCHELL
Patch me through to Colonel Pendergast.
[The countdown clock moves past one minute twenty-six seconds.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
PENDERGAST
Cam! What can I do for you?
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
MITCHELL
I need a little help moving.
INT--HALCYON TOWER
[The building is empty of people.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[They watch as the countdown clock goes from fourteen seconds past
seven seconds.]
EXT--HALCYON TOWER, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, DAY
[An Asgard beam activates, and the Halcyon tower disappears from
between the neighboring skyscrapers.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The clock counts down from three seconds.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Halcyon Tower appears in space near Prometheus via the transport
beam.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The clock counts down to zero and a high-pitched beeping sounds.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Halcyon Tower explodes. Prometheus is caught in the blast wave,
but its shields counter any effect.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
PENDERGAST
(over radio)
It worked. The building detonated at a safe distance.
HARRIMAN
Sir, I've got Doctor Jackson.
DANIEL
(over speakerphone)
General?
LANDRY
What's happening out there, Doctor?
DANIEL
(over speakerphone)
I'm sorry to report, sir, it looks like...Ba'al escaped.
[Landry sighs and shares frustrated looks with Mitchell and Teal'c.]
EXT--DAKARA, DAY
INT--DAKARA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER
[Teal'c stands in the center of the room, surrounded by other Jaffa,
all wearing robes.]
TEAL'C
The old ways will no longer serve us. Gerak's ways are not the ways
of the future.
[The Jaffa surrounding him nod vigorously, talking amongst themselves.
Gerak enters the room and comes down the staircase.]
TEAL'C
(accusing)
How dare you. How dare you step foot in this council chamber!
GERAK
Why should I pause to return? Tell me, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
(furious)
Because you disregarded my warnings. Because your rash actions not
only allowed Ba'al to escape, but cost the lives of many of our
brothers!
GERAK
They did not die in vain.
[Yat'yir and another Jaffa lead Ba'al, shackled by hand and foot,
disheveled, and bloody, down the steps into the chamber. Teal'c watches
in surprise. They force Ba'al to kneel, and he looks at Teal'c with
defiance.]
GERAK
My rash actions were necessary, I'm sure you'll agree. Yes, you may
muse about what "might have been," but the fact remains, it was my
men who captured Ba'al.
[The Jaffa start muttering amongst themselves. Ba'al sneers at the
Jaffa, coughing up blood.]
BA'AL
(in Goa'uld echo)
Enjoy your short-lived taste of freedom. You were born slaves, and
slaves you will die.
[Gerak takes a staff weapon from Yat'yir and fires it into Ba'al's
back. Ba'al collapses to the floor. Teal'c stares, stunned.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Teal'c comes through the active Stargate and walks down the ramp. The
rest of SG-1 are there to greet him.]
TEAL'C
Ba'al did not escape. He was captured by Gerak's forces.
[Daniel, Mitchell and Carter look at each other and shift
uncomfortably.]
MITCHELL
Well, yes and no.
TEAL'C
(angrily)
He was dragged into the council chamber and executed before my very
eyes. There IS no doubt.
CARTER
Teal'c, we secured Ba'al's compound and searched the premises. In
the basement, we discovered a lab containing equipment and data
related to genetic replication.
DANIEL
It's very possible the Ba'al you saw die in Dakara was just a clone.
The real Ba'al could still be out there.
[Teal'c considers this and moves slowly off the ramp and towards the
door.]
MITCHELL
Hey, where're you going?
TEAL'C
(smiling sadly)
To take a much needed rest.
[The three look at him with puzzled expressions.]
MITCHELL
Don't you think you should go back to Dakara? Let those Jaffa know
the truth?
TEAL'C
(bitter)
No. To reveal this at this time would seem little more than an
attempt to tarnish Gerak's hard fought victory.
MITCHELL
Teal'c...it's the truth.
TEAL'C
Regardless, they will not listen. For the time being, their hearts
belong to Gerak.
[The three look at Teal'c with concern as he nods and slowly leaves the
room.]
INT--LIVING ROOM IN WELL DECORATED HOME
[On a television screen, Donovan walks down a street giving a news
report.]
DONOVAN
At present, there are more questions than answers in the events
surrounding the gas explosion that claimed the Halcyon Tower in
downtown Seattle. What we do know so far is that at approximately
12:45 this afternoon, local fire and emergency crews were dispatched
to the scene. An evacuation order was given, and the building and
surrounding areas were evacuated. Two hours later, when reporters
were permitted to return to the area, all that remained was a heap
of rubble. Surrounded as it was by taller high rises, there were no
eyewitnesses to the building's destruction--no one saw or heard the
explosion. And as a result, conspiracy theories abound. Some have
pointed out that the amount of rubble at the site is significantly
less than...
[As the television drones, Ba'al watches the report, lounging in a
chair wearing a polo shirt and khaki pants. Nearby, another Ba'al,
wearing a short sleeve, button-down grey shirt and slacks sits in a
chair, using chopsticks to eat Chinese food out of a takeout container.
Another Ba'al in a tank top stands behind a bar, pouring drinks. Seated
at a bar stool is Mayfield. Eventually Polo Shirt Ba'al clicks the
remote and turns off the television while Donovan is still speaking.]
POLO SHIRT BA'AL
(shakes his head, irritated)
Over six hundred channels and nothing to watch. Think I'll turn in.
We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
[Polo Shirt Ba'al leaves the room. Mayfield takes two drinks, giving
one to yet another Ba'al wearing a long sleeve shirt who sits on the
sofa reading a paper. She keeps the other drink for herself and sits
next to him. Tank Top Ba'al walks into the center of the room, sipping
his own drink.]
