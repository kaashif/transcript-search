   EXCERPTS FROM 9.01 "AVALON PART 1"

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Vala, Daniel, and Mitchell talk at Daniel's desk.]

     MITCHELL
     Merlin? King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table? Merlin?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     MITCHELL
     Was an Ancient?

     DANIEL
     I think so.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel briefs Mitchell, Landry, Teal'c, and Vala on the Arthurian
   legend.]

     LANDRY
     What does this have to do with where this alleged treasure was
     buried?

     DANIEL

     (voiceover)
     Certain threads point to the Knights of the Round Table gathering
     great treasures from the far corners of Arthur's domain and hiding
     them in a magical stronghold at Avalon.

   EXCERPT FROM 9.02 "AVALON PART 2"

   INT--AVALON CAVES

   [Mitchell picks up the sword returns it to the stone, sliding it easily
   into the rock. Once replaced, the chamber fills with gold urns, vases,
   statues, goblets, coins, jewels and other treasures. Mitchell looks
   around.]

   EXCERPTS FROM 9.08 "BABYLON"

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Mitchell moves on his knees, grabs Volnek's staff weapon, turns, and
   shoots Volnek in the abdomen. (The staff weapon is smaller than the
   typical Jaffa weapon, but has the same type of fire.) Volnek falls onto
   his back.]

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

     TEAL'C

     (voiceover)
     All free Jaffa have always had the greatest respect for the warriors
     of the Sodan.

   [Jolan and Mitchell spar in the Sodan training ring.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The wormhole opens. Mitchell and Volnek stand at the base of the
   ramp.]

     VOLNEK
     Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.

   [He walks up the ramp and turns around.]

     VOLNEK
     We will meet again.

   [He enters the wormhole.]

   TEASER

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Carter leans against a worktable tapping keys on her laptop. She looks
   very tired. The computer is wired to a four-tiered alien device that is
   also on the table. Mitchell approaches from the corridor outside and
   leans against the door frame.]

     MITCHELL
     You are still working on that thing!

     CARTER

     (guiltily)
     Oh, hi.

     MITCHELL
     Did you sleep here last night?

     CARTER
     Of course not. I slept down the hall in my quarters.

     MITCHELL

     (in scolding tone)
     Sam--

     CARTER

     (defensively)
     This device was recovered from the cave under Glastonbury. Who knows
     what Ancient secrets it may hold?

     MITCHELL
     Well, obviously not you, or Doctor Lee who's been working on that
     thing for what, six months? I think it's time we let the eggheads at
     Area 51 take a crack at it.

   [Carter grimaces as Mitchell points out their lack of progress.]

     CARTER
     Not yet! I--I'm actually making some progress here.

     MITCHELL
     That's what you said last night. And I'm hankering for hash browns,
     so let's go grab some breakfast!

   [Mitchell starts heading out the door. Carter is distracted by a
   reading on her laptop display.]

     CARTER
     He-hey! This is interesting! This is the first time one of my
     verification scans kicked back a positive result.

   [Mitchell pauses at the door. He fidgets as he slowly returns to her.]

     MITCHELL
     Does this mean I'm not getting my hash browns?

     CARTER
     It means this device is interactive. I'm reading an E.M. output that
     keeps fluctuating between high and low frequencies. I'm going to try
     to stabilize it.

     MITCHELL
     Sure. What have you got to lose?

   [Carter types some commands into her keyboard. A small blue rectangle
   at the top center of the device glows and gives off a bright white
   light that encompasses Mitchell and Carter. Mitchell and Carter wince
   at the blinding flash. The light disappears, and with it, so do
   Mitchell and Carter.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Mitchell and Carter wince and blink, still trying to readjust from the
   blinding flash of light.]

     CARTER
     You okay?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, fine. What just happened?

   [The center portion of the device gives off a softer orange glow now
   and projects several lines of Ancient text into the air in front of
   Mitchell and Carter.]

     MITCHELL
     Whoa. Nicely done. Can you read that?

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     My Ancient's a little rusty.

     MITCHELL
     Right. We need Jackson.

   [Both turn to leave. Lee enters the lab carrying some food on a tray,
   including a mug of coffee and a serving of blue Jell-o.]

     CARTER
     Hey, Bill, good timing! Take a look at this.

   [Carter and Mitchell turn back to the display. Lee picks up the mug and
   the Jell-o and turns around with a smile. His smile quickly falters,
   and he looks around, confused. Mitchell notices his reaction and
   frowns. Lee stops by a laptop on another table. He sets down the coffee
   mug and presses a few keys.]

     MITCHELL

     (gesturing)
     Yo, Doc, amazing discovery over here!

   [Carter turns and notices Lee's confused reactions. She furrows her
   eyebrows.]

     CARTER
     Bill, you okay?

   [Carter moves towards him. Lee continues towards Carter's station while
   still carrying the blue Jell-o. He walks right through Carter and heads
   to her laptop. Carter reacts with shock and feels her body after Lee
   has passed through. Mitchell jumps back in shock.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh! What the hell!?!

   [Carter and Mitchell remain shocked as Lee glances at Carter's laptop
   and frowns. He puts down the dessert and leaves his lab, looking
   confused.]

     MITCHELL
     What was that?

     CARTER

     (worried)
     I don't know.

   [Mitchell tentatively touches Carter on the shoulder. She reciprocates.
   He pokes her harder. She shoves him back. He raises his hand in
   surrender.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, you're solid.

   [Carter looks at the device.]

     CARTER
     It's the device. By initiating it, we must have triggered some sort
     of localized effect.

     MITCHELL
     "Local" meaning you and me?

     CARTER
     Yeah. Try picking up that coffee cup.

   [She points to the mug Lee left behind. Mitchell reaches over to pick
   up the coffee cup, and his hand passes right through it.]

     CARTER

     (sighing)
     Oh boy. We need to find Daniel.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Mitchell walk quickly down the hall. They consciously avoid
   the passersby so the personnel do not pass through their bodies.]

     MITCHELL
     "Out of phase." What does that mean?

     CARTER
     It means we may have shifted to an alternate dimension.

     MITCHELL

     (by rote)
     And there are an infinite number of alternate dimensions.

     CARTER
     No, no, no. That's alternate realities.

     MITCHELL
     So when the other SG-1s showed up...

     CARTER
     Completely different problem. See, according to M-theory, that
     unites the five super-string theories, there are several spacial
     dimensions, eleven actually, that exist in parallel with our
     physical reality. Now, these higher dimensions--

     MITCHELL

     (interrupting)
     No, I'll take your word for it. That was alternate reality. This is
     alternate dimension. Hell, all I need is a good time-travel
     adventure, and I've scored the SG-1 trifecta. Now, how is Jackson
     supposed to help us with this?

     CARTER
     Well, a similar thing happened to him a few years ago.

     MITCHELL

     (after a moment)
     PX7-377! The crystal skull!

     CARTER

     (surprised)
     You really did read every report from every mission we ever went on,
     didn't you?

     MITCHELL
     I was in that hospital a long time, and they were all riveting.

     CARTER

     (chuckling)
     Anyway, when Daniel was out of phase, nobody could see him except
     for his grandfather, Nicholas Ballard.

     MITCHELL

     (realizing)
     And because the same thing happened to Ballard in Belize, Jackson
     should be able to see us because we're all part of the same club.

     CARTER
     Right.

   [Mitchell snaps his fingers.]

     MITCHELL
     Perfect.

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [Teal'c wears a red tank top, workout pants, and sneakers. He removes a
   towel from over his shoulder, opens his locker door and throws the
   towel inside. Landry rushes into the room, still in his leather jacket
   and carrying a report.]

     LANDRY
     Teal'c, have you see Colonel Mitchell?

     TEAL'C
     I have not.

     LANDRY
     I'm going to need to talk to your team. SG-12 just got back from
     P8T-474, and it looks like we may have a timeline for whatever it is
     the Priors are planning. According to the natives, this "doomsday"
     the Priors keep talking about may be only days away.

     TEAL'C

     (bowing his head)
     I will inform the others.

   [Landry nods his head in acknowledgment and leaves.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Carter turn a corner and see Daniel walking straight
   towards them.]

     MITCHELL
     Jackson! Just the guy to help us with a little problem.

   [Daniel does not look up. He continues walking, hands in pockets. He
   walks straight through Mitchell. Mitchell looks very uncomfortable
   after the experience.]

     MITCHELL
     Or not.

     CARTER

     (grimacing)
     The dimension we're occupying must be different from the one he was
     shifted to.

     MITCHELL

     (annoyed)
     Alternate alternate dimensions?

     CARTER

     (weakly)
     Something like that, yeah.

     MITCHELL
     Okay. So, what do we do?

     CARTER
     We have to find a way to communicate with them.

     MITCHELL

     (irritated)
     Any ideas?

   [Carter opens her mouth to speak, but the klaxons start to blare.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Unscheduled offworld activation!

   [Carter signals Mitchell, and both quickly move out of the way as
   Daniel runs past towards the Control Room. Mitchell and Carter jog
   after him.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel, Mitchell, and Carter join Teal'c, who is now wearing his black
   uniform tank top and fatigue pants, and Landry, who is out of his
   leather jacket by now. Harriman and another technician are at the
   controls.]

     DANIEL
     What've we got?

     HARRIMAN
     No IDC, sir. But I am receiving a radio signal.

     LANDRY
     Let's hear it.

   [A garbled crackling sounds over the intercom.]

     LANDRY
     What's wrong with it?

     CARTER
     Sounds like harmonic distortion in the data stream.

     HARRIMAN
     I'm not sure, sir.

   [Carter rolls her eyes as she realizes no one can hear her.]

     LANDRY
     Can you clean it up?

     HARRIMAN
     I can try, sir.

   [A loud thunk is heard against the iris.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, that sounded like something hitting the iris.

     LANDRY
     Any way to know for sure what it was?

     HARRIMAN
     We can run some tests.

     LANDRY
     Do it. And get Colonel Carter down here to help unscramble that
     message.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   [Carter raises her arms in frustration and sighs. She and Mitchell
   exchange looks as Landry and Daniel leave the room.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Harriman and the other technician continue to work at their stations.
   Carter hovers over Harriman's shoulder.]

     HARRIMAN

     (shaking his head)
     I can't make heads or tails of this.

     CARTER
     That's because the filter coefficient has to be adaptive.

   [She moves over to the other technician.]

     CARTER
     The filter coefficient has to be adaptive!

     TECHNICIAN
     Hey, wait a minute.

     CARTER

     (pleased)
     There you go. Notice the slight variance in the output...Notice
     it...
     (a longer pause, becoming frustrated)
     Come on! Notice it!

     TECHNICIAN
     Never mind.

   [Carter lets out a disgusted noise and moves between them again.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Daniel and Teal'c are reporting to Landry.]

     LANDRY

     (standing)
     What do you mean, they're missing?

     TEAL'C
     They are not in their quarters, nor are they responding to any
     attempt to contact them.

     LANDRY
     Is it possible they aren't even on the base?

     DANIEL
     We checked the front gate. Neither of them signed out.

     LANDRY
     What about security footage?

     DANIEL
     We're reviewing tapes for both the labs and the cafeteria. But
     beyond that, well, there are...hundreds of cameras and hours of
     tape, so...

     LANDRY
     Then we'll screen them all if we have to. I want them found.

   [Daniel and Teal'c leave the office. Mitchell, who has been there the
   whole time, remains behind.]

     MITCHELL
     Why am I getting that "Patrick Swayze in Ghost" feeling?

   [Landry starts writing some notes.]

     MITCHELL
     General, we need a Whoopi.

   [Landry pauses for a moment, then continues to write. Mitchell shakes
   his head in frustration and leaves.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry, Daniel, and Teal'c (with Mitchell) join Harriman and the
   technician (and Carter).]

     LANDRY
     Walter?

     HARRIMAN
     We managed to clean up the message, sir.

     CARTER

     (snarkily)
     Finally.

     HARRIMAN
     We noticed a slight variance in the output, so we ran it through a
     sequence of digital filters, and we came up with this.

   [A garbled message begins to play through the speakers.]

     SODAN WARRIOR

     (over transmission)
     Stargate Command...the Sodan. Please respond.

   [Teal'c reacts with concern.]

     LANDRY
     Did he say "Sodan"?

     SODAN WARRIOR

     (over transmission)
     ...under attack. Many have fallen. We request immediate assistance.

   [Staff blasts and cries of pain can be heard before the transmission
   cuts off. They all exchange concerned looks.]

     HARRIMAN
     And that's when we heard the impact against the iris, sir.

     TEAL'C
     General Landry, we should investigate.

     LANDRY
     Agreed. Assemble a team.

   [Teal'c bows in acknowledgment.]

     DANIEL
     Sir, Colonel Mitchell's the one who should go. He's the one who
     knows the Sodan the best.

     LANDRY
     I agree, but Colonel Mitchell isn't here right now.

   [Mitchell and Carter exchange resigned expressions.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR, LEVEL 28

   [Lee exits the elevator as Daniel walks into it. Daniel's head is down,
   lost in thought.]

     LEE
     Oh, hey! Have you seen Colonel Carter?

   [Lee stops the doors from closing. Daniel looks up in surprise.]

     DANIEL
     Hey, I was just coming to ask you the same thing.

     LEE
     Really? Because she left her laptop in my lab.

     DANIEL
     She did?

   [Lee enters the elevator.]

     LEE
     Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, hooked up to that device that you picked up in
     Glastonbury.

   [Lee presses a floor button. As the doors begin to close, Daniel dodges
   them and exits the elevator, a strange expression on his face. Lee
   stops the doors from closing and follows him.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel and Lee stand behind Harriman and the other technician as they
   review security footage of Lee's lab. The monitor shows footage of
   Carter leaning on the table by her laptop.]

     LEE
     There she is.

     DANIEL
     Fast forward.

   [Harriman alters the tape and it fast forwards. They spot Mitchell
   approaching and leaning against the door frame.]

     LEE
     There's Colonel Mitchell.

   [The tape continues to move at faster than its normal speed. The group
   watches as the events that occurred just before Mitchell and Carter
   became out of phase play out on the monitor. Just as Carter types some
   commands on the keyboard (when the device activated), the screen turns
   to static.]

     DANIEL
     What just happened?

     HARRIMAN
     Looks like the camera went offline. Probably a power surge.

   [After a few moments, the security picture returns. The room is empty.
   They stare in shock at the footage.]

     LEE
     They're gone!

     DANIEL
     Okay, bring up the security camera for the corridor outside Doctor
     Lee's lab, sync them up to 8:16, and run them simultaneously.

   [Harriman punches some commands into his computer. The monitor shows a
   split screen of the corridor and Lee's lab as Mitchell and Carter talk.
   While the lab screen becomes static, the corridor footage remains
   clear. No one enters or exits the corridor. The lab footage screen
   returns with Mitchell and Carter gone.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, if they didn't go through the doorway, how did they get out of
     the room?

   EXT--FOREST BY TRANSPORTER, P9G-844 DAY

   [The "Eye of the Gods" Ancient transporter activates and Teal'c and
   SG-12 appear, weapons at ready. Teal'c holds a weapon in each hand. The
   team spreads out in a defensive pattern.]

     HADDEN
     More staff blasts, just like back at the Gate.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. A battle took place here as well.

     HADDEN
     The Sodan have been hiding here for thousands of years. The only
     reason we got their transporter codes is because Col. Mitchell won
     their trust. I doubt they would've given them to anyone else.

     TEAL'C
     And yet evidently they were attacked.

     HADDEN
     By who?

   [Teal'c shoots Hadden a serious look before taking point. The team
   follows.]

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

   [The village is in ruins. Some corpses are scattered around. All the
   homes have been burnt out, fires still smoldering. SG-12 and Teal'c
   look around in shock as they approach.]

     HADDEN
     My God. Conway, Stevens, get back to the Gate on the double. Tell
     SGC we need med teams.

     CONWAY
     Yes, sir.

   [Conway and Stevens move out. Teal'c moves ahead.]

     HADDEN

     (to McKensie)
     Check the area for survivors.

   [Hadden, Teal'c, and McKensie enter the village. They find more
   wreckage and several bodies scattered across the village. Teal'c checks
   the vitals for one Sodan.]

     TEAL'C
     Whomever did this knew well the most efficient way to kill Jaffa.
     Their symbiotes have been targeted. They were shown no mercy.

   [They spot movement further away. Haikon is wounded and groaning. They
   move to him and kneel beside him, checking him over.]

     TEAL'C
     Haikon.

     HADDEN
     Pulse is weak.

     TEAL'C
     He will not survive long. His symbiote is dead.

     HADDEN
     Lieutenant, help me get him into one of these huts. We need to get
     some tretonin in him, stat.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, NEAR COMMISSARY

   [An airman walks by with a tray as a kitchen worker puts a tray of food
   into a serving cart. Carter and Mitchell loiter nearby. Mitchell points
   at the passing airman's tray.]

     MITCHELL

     Roast beef. The one time I can't eat, and they serve roast beef.
     (shouting to kitchen worker)
     Do you know how many times I've requested roast beef?!?
     (to Carter)
     This is torture.

     CARTER
     It's only been a few hours.

     MITCHELL
     You're not the least bit concerned about this? No one can see us or
     hear us. We can't touch anything, ergo no eating, no drinking, and
     I'm not going to speculate on the other bodily functions. If they
     don't figure out a way to get us back...

     CARTER
     They'll figure it out.

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Lee has yellow tape and cones surrounding the worktable where the
   alien device and Carter's laptop are. He works at his station while
   Ronald manipulates a camera connected to a large pole. Landry and
   Daniel enter.]

     LANDRY
     What have you got, Doctor?

     LEE
     Well, we know that Sam was working on the device. We know the device
     does not give off any typical energy signatures emitted by Ancient
     transporter technology. This leads us to the conclusion that they
     disappeared without leaving the room.

     LANDRY
     How is that possible?

     LEE
     Miniaturization.

   [Landry and Daniel exchange surprised looks.]

     LEE
     Don't panic. I have calculated the distance they could possibly
     travel on tiny legs designated by this roped off area. All we have
     to do is find them. Ronald, start with section 1-A.

   [Daniel bites his lip and drops his head, and Landry looks over in
   disbelief.]

   INT--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

   [Teal'c checks one last Sodan in the square outside before heading over
   to the hut. Haikon lies inside the hut, Lt. McKensie treating his
   injuries.]

     TEAL'C

     I was unable to locate any other survivors.
     (softer)
     What is his condition?

     HADDEN
     We don't know if the tretonin's going to take. Even then, his
     injuries are pretty severe. Without a symbiote...

     HAIKON

     (weakly)
     Volnek.

   [Teal'c moves to his side.]

     TEAL'C
     Haikon. Haikon. Fear not, brother. You are among friends.

     HAIKON

     (weakly)
     Teal'c. Save yourself. You shouldn't be here.

     TEAL'C
     Tell me who has done this. Tell me who has caused this devastation.

     HAIKON
     Volnek. It was Volnek.

     HADDEN

     (incredulous)
     One man did this?

     TEAL'C
     Why would he turn on his people? Tell me. Haikon...Haikon?

   [Haikon loses consciousness.]

     CONWAY

     (over radio)
     Major, come in!

     HADDEN

     (into radio)
     This is Hadden. Go ahead!

     CONWAY

     (over radio)
     We're under attack, sir. Requesting backup immediately!

   [Staff weapon's fire can be heard over the transmission. Screams are
   heard before the transmission cuts off.]

     HADDEN
     McKensie, you stay with him.

   [Teal'c and Hadden move out.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [The cones and yellow tape are gone. Lee stands in front of the alien
   device, running a radiation monitor carefully over every inch of it.
   Daniel enters the lab, stopping short and pointedly looking around at
   the floor before smiling at Lee.]

     LEE
     Oh, come on, it was just a theory. Anyway, if I'd been right, you'd
     all be calling be a genius right now.

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Yes, but you weren't right. So, anything?

     LEE

     (placing earphones over his ears)
     Ah, eh, nothing significant. Fairly, eh, constant power readings
     and, uh, slight traces of lepton radiation.

     DANIEL

     (visibly reacting)
     What?!?

   [Lee turns back to Daniel, unable to hear with the earphones on.]

     LEE
     What?

     DANIEL

     Lepton radiation?
     (louder)
     Lepton...

   [Lee takes off the headphones.]

     DANIEL

     (voice lowering)
     Lepton radiation?

     LEE
     Yeah, but like I said, only traces. I mean, there's nothing
     significant there.

     DANIEL
     Gotta go.

   [Daniel races out of the lab.]

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Teal'c and Hadden find Conway and Stevens lying on the forest ground,
   wounded.]

     HADDEN
     Stevens!

   [Hadden checks the vitals for Stevens. Teal'c reaches the teleportation
   device, remaining standing and weapons alert as he backs towards the
   device.]

     TEAL'C
     This one is alive.

   [Hadden races over. He pulls out a syringe from his vest and injects
   Conway.]

     CONWAY

     (weakly)
     I never saw him. The shots came out of nowhere.

     TEAL'C
     No doubt Volnek is using a Sodan cloak.

     HADDEN
     We gotta get him back to the Gate now.

   [Teal'c holds both his weapons in one hand and punches the controls.
   Nothing happens.]

     HADDEN
     What's wrong?

     TEAL'C
     The code is not working.

   [Hadden grabs his weapon. Teal'c pulls open the panel. He looks at it
   briefly before closing it again.]

     TEAL'C
     Someone has removed one of the control crystals.

     HADDEN
     Then how're we supposed to get out of here?

     TEAL'C

     (worried)
     We cannot.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel's worktable is covered with open books, many very old. Daniel
   studies three texts simultaneously, taking notes. Mitchell fidgets
   nervously nearby.]

     MITCHELL
     Come on, Jackson. Figure it out. I've already missed breakfast and
     lunch.

   [Daniel hears footsteps and looks up.]

     DANIEL
     General.

     LANDRY
     Dr. Jackson. I just came from Dr. Lee's lab. Please tell me you have
     better news.

     DANIEL
     I've been going over some of the texts we recovered from the cave in
     Glastonbury.

     LANDRY
     And?

     DANIEL
     Well, a lot of them seem to make oblique references to Arthurian
     legend. For instance, the word "anawyn", which shows up several
     times, is I believe a variation on "annwn", the Celtic underworld
     where King Arthur journeyed in search of thirteen sacred
     objects...one of which was a cloak.

   [Daniel hands Landry an illustrated book.]

     MITCHELL
     What, the picture of the guy with the big, billowing robes?

     DANIEL
     Said to render the wearer invisible. It was called the "Mantle of
     Arthur" and was kept at Bardsey Island by none other than our good
     friend Myrddin, whom we know better as...

     LANDRY

     (smiling)
     Merlin.

     DANIEL
     Exactly.

   [Landry hands the book back.]

     LANDRY
     I have no idea where you're going with this.

     MITCHELL
     Me either.

     DANIEL

     (speaking more quickly)
     Well, it wasn't until Dr. Lee told me that he detected trace amounts
     of lepton radiation from the device that I was able to put it
     together. You see, the crystal skull that transported me to another
     dimension also released lepton radiation.

   [Mitchell bounces with excitement.]

     LANDRY
     And you think the same thing happened to Col. Carter and Col.
     Mitchell?

     MITCHELL

     (excited)
     You're damn right!

     DANIEL
     According to legend, the mantle makes the user invisible. Now, given
     what I've read and what's happened today, I'm guessing it wasn't
     literally a cloak at all.

     LANDRY
     It was the device we recovered.

     DANIEL
     It makes sense, sir. Medieval historians could well have attributed
     the powers of the device to a cloak simply because they didn't
     understand it. And they could have credited its recovery to Arthur,
     out of deference to their king, who was in power at the time. Now
     given what we know now, it seems much more likely that it was Merlin
     who actually built the device.

     LANDRY
     So why would Merlin build a device that could transport him to
     another dimension?

     MITCHELL
     Ooh, today's daily double.

     DANIEL
     Uh, yeah, tha-that's the part I haven't quite figured out yet.

     MITCHELL

     (wincing)
     Close.

     DANIEL
     But at least it points to the possibility that both Col. Mitchell
     and Col. Carter may still be somewhere here on this base.

   [Mitchell raises his hands like a referee giving the touchdown/goal
   sign.]

     DANIEL

     (continuing)
     We just can't see or hear them.

   [Daniel and Landry look around the room uncomfortably, wondering if
   Mitchell or Carter are there. To their view, the area is otherwise
   empty.]

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

   [Hadden looks into the hut. Haikon is still unconscious. McKensie has
   Conway hooked up to an I.V. and is treating his wounds. Hadden
   approaches Teal'c who is pulling a Sodan cloaking device off the arm of
   a dead warrior.]

     HADDEN
     We could make our way back to the Gate on foot.

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe that would be wise. The journey would take months,
     and the terrain is most treacherous.

     HADDEN
     There's not much for us, here. We're going to run out of supplies
     before long.

     TEAL'C
     General Landry will send an extraction team when we fail to report.

     HADDEN
     And they'll end up stranded here just like us.

     TEAL'C
     We have food for the moment, and we can build shelter. Perhaps when
     the extraction team arrives, we can repair the obelisk.

     HADDEN
     What about Volnek? He's still out there.

     TEAL'C
     Leave him to me.

   [He turns to go. Hadden stops him.]

     HADDEN
     Teal'c. He took out an entire village.

     TEAL'C
     It is my understanding that those who use a Sodan cloaking device
     are invisible to everyone but each other.

     HADDEN
     So if you use that thing, you'll be able to see him.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     HADDEN
     Didn't help that guy much though, did it?

   [They both look down at the dead Sodan. Teal'c grabs his weapons and
   leaves. Hadden sighs.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Daniel, Landry and Lee are gathered near Merlin's device. Upon closer
   examination, the tiers are made up of several buttons with Ancient
   symbols engraved on them. In this dimension, the device is dark,
   projecting nothing.]

     DANIEL
     Now, when I was out of phase, I could both see and hear everything
     that was going on around me. So it follows, if they're in the same
     situation, they're hearing what we're saying right now.

     LANDRY
     Except they can't respond.

     DANIEL
     Maybe they can. They just don't know it. Now, what does that look
     like to you? First reaction.

   [He gestures to the device.]

     LEE
     A keyboard. Uh, except there's no visual interface.

     DANIEL
     Not here.

     LEE
     You mean it's on the...other side?

     DANIEL
     Well, it stands to reason that Merlin would want the device to be
     interactive on both sides, this and the alternate dimension. Now,
     the interactivity on this side is difficult to access. Now, I'm
     guessing as a type of safeguard against just anyone using the
     device.

     LANDRY
     But there'd be no reason to hide it on the other side.

   [Lee and Daniel notice one of the keys on the device being struck
   rapidly in succession.]

     LEE
     Whoa! Whoa. Did you see that?

     DANIEL
     Oh, yeah.

   [Mitchell stops pressing the key and pumps his fist before exchanging a
   high five with Carter. The device in their dimension still projects the
   Ancient text.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah!

     DANIEL

     (loudly)
     Sam? Uh, Mitchell? If--if you can hear me, uh, okay, let's call this
     button "yes" and this button "no".

   [Before he's even finished speaking, the "yes" button is depressed.
   Mitchell follows by pressing the "no" button.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, uh, first question. Um, are you guys okay?

     CARTER
     Yes.

     MITCHELL
     Yep.

   [Mitchell presses the "yes" key.]

     LEE
     "Yes." Oh, thank God. I mean, now we're getting somewhere.

     DANIEL
     Okay, um, besides the interactivity, is there anything else unusual
     on your end?

   [The "yes" button is depressed.]

     DANIEL
     "Yes." Something connected to the device?

     MITCHELL

     (gesturing to the projected image)
     Would you call that connected?

     CARTER

     (impatiently)
     Yes, yes, yes.

     MITCHELL
     Yes.

   [Mitchell presses the "yes" key. Landry nods in satisfaction at these
   results.]

     DANIEL
     "Yes." Is it some sort of display?

   [The "yes" key is depressed several times rapidly.]

     LEE
     That's, uh, that's an emphatic "yes".

     DANIEL
     Okay, thought so. Um, can you read it?

   [There is a slight pause, then the "no" key is depressed. Daniel slumps
   in despair.]

     DANIEL
     It's in Ancient, isn't it?

   [The "yes" key is depressed several times, rapidly. Daniel sighs again
   before moving to the other table and grabbing a notepad and book. He
   pulls over a stool and sits.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, um, all right. Now, you guys are going to have to help me
     translate what you see, but you see, we don't know what pressing
     buttons randomly will do. So, we're going to have to stick with
     "yes" and "no" and just do it. One letter at a time.

   [Mitchell and Carter exchange grim looks before sighing.]

     LANDRY
     This going to take a while?

     DANIEL
     Oh, yeah.

     LANDRY
     Just keep me posted.

     DANIEL
     Yes, sir.

   [Landry leaves.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, um, first letter.

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Teal'c walks through the forest. He pauses and notes some fresh sap on
   a young tree. He triggers the cloaking device on his arm and vanishes.]

   [From Teal'c's perspective, the forest takes on a more monochromatic
   hue now that he is using the cloak. He raises his weapons and moves
   forward.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry enters the control room. Harriman is at his station.]

     LANDRY
     Status?

     HARRIMAN
     Still no word from Teal'c or SG-12.

     LANDRY
     How long are they overdue?

     HARRIMAN
     Over an hour.

     LANDRY
     Tell Col. Reynolds to prep an extraction team. Have them ready to
     move out, ASAP.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   [Mitchell has overheard the conversation and looks grim.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Lee has moved over to the other work table. Daniel takes notes. Carter
   stands next to him.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, first letter, next word. Stop me when you see the right
     symbol.

   [Daniel moves his finger across the open pages of his book, which is
   filled with the symbols of the Ancient alphabet. Mitchell enters the
   room.]

     MITCHELL
     How's it going?

     CARTER

     (sarcastic)
     Fantastic. We've almost completed the first sentence.

     MITCHELL
     Listen, you think you'll be okay on your own here for a while?

     CARTER
     Sure, why?

     MITCHELL
     We've lost contact with Teal'c. Landry's sending SG-3 and 22 to
     check on him at the Sodan village. I figured I'd tag along.

     CARTER

     (concerned)
     Offworld?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, well Jackson was able to travel through the Gate when he was
     out of phase. So, yeah.

     CARTER
     Well, that's my point. You're out of phase. What do you hope to
     accomplish?

     MITCHELL

     (forcefully)
     Sam, Teal'c could be in trouble. I want to check it out. No one can
     see me. I can't get hurt. I can gather intel that no one else can.

   [Daniel reaches the end of the two pages.]

     DANIEL
     Sam, Mitchell, did you see it?

   [Carter glances at Daniel before focusing her attention on Mitchell.
   Her jaw is set, and she glares at him, clearly unhappy.]

     MITCHELL
     Listen, I promise, I'll come back through the Gate when they dial to
     check in. I'll only be gone a couple of hours.

     DANIEL

     (louder)
     Hello? You guys still there?

   [Lee gets up, looking around in alarm when he realizes Daniel is not
   getting a response.]

     CARTER
     Cameron--

     MITCHELL
     Sam, Teal'c may need help, and I have friends among the Sodan. I'll
     be back soon. Promise.

   [Mitchell leaves.]

     DANIEL
     Like, slap a button or something.

   [Carter slams down a few keys angrily as she huffs in frustration. Lee
   moves back to his station.]

     DANIEL

     (surprised at the vehemence)
     Okay, thank you. Um, okay, first letter, next word, and stop me when
     you see the right symbol.

   [Carter directs her attention between the projection and Daniel's
   book.]

   INT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Teal'c moves through the forest, still cloaked. He spots a downed
   warrior and approaches him, checking to see if he still breathes. He
   hears some twigs snapping and stands, alert. Suddenly, he is struck in
   the left shoulder by a staff blast. He dives to the ground. Volnek is
   behind him, and fires the staff weapon several times. Teal'c takes
   cover behind a large tree stump.]

   [Teal'c suddenly stands and fires both weapons at Volnek, striking him
   several times in the chest. Volnek falls to the ground. Teal'c
   cautiously leaves his cover and approaches. After a few steps, Volnek
   opens his eyes and sits up with an animalistic snarl. He fires his
   weapon again, but Teal'c dodges, and it hits the tree behind him.
   Volnek's eyes are blood red around their irises, where they would
   normally be white. His teeth are corroded and his complexion mottled.
   He fires his weapon several times as Teal'c runs away from the blasts.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [The "yes" button on the device is depressed.]

     DANIEL
     "Yes." Okay. Next word.

   [Daniel makes a note on his pad.]

     LEE
     That's it! My God, I finally figured out what Col. Carter did to
     trigger the device!

   [Daniel looks over at Lee, glancing back at where he suspects Carter is
   before turning back to Lee again.]

     LEE
     I had to run a reverse scan on all the energy fluctuations that
     we've been recording, put them through a program designed
     to...anyway, I isolated the algorithm she used to synchronize the
     energy emissions coming from the device.

     DANIEL

     (totally lost)
     What?!?

     LEE
     Don't you see? That means if I counteract Sam's algorithm from my
     computer, allow the emissions to return to their normal frequencies,
     that could well reverse the process.

   [Daniel sighs and looks skeptical.]

     LEE
     Oh, just give me a second. This is brilliant.

   [Lee presses a few keys on his computer. Daniel sighs and stands,
   recapping his pen.]

     LEE
     That should do it!

   [Lee presses the "Enter" key on his keyboard. Daniel shies away from
   the blinding light. Carter blinks through the experience and watches
   with interest. Lee continues to study his laptop monitor. Daniel turns
   around and spots Carter.]

     DANIEL

     (nonplussed)
     Sam.

     CARTER

     (grinning widely)
     Daniel!

     DANIEL

     (ecstatic)
     Bill, I will never doubt you again.

   [Daniel turns back around to look at Lee. Lee turns from his laptop
   grinning, but his face immediately falls, dejected. He looks around and
   sighs.]

     LEE
     Oh, boy.

   [Daniel is discomfited by Lee's reaction. Carter's smile falters.]

     LEE
     Dr. Jackson, can--can you hear me?

   [Lee walks through Daniel over to Merlin's device and sits on Daniel's
   stool. Carter winces in sympathy as Daniel slumps in resignation.]

     LEE
     If you can, press this button for "yes".

   [Carter presses the "yes" key. Lee leans on his hand and sighs in
   frustration. Daniel offers Carter a false smile as she sighs in
   despair.]

   INT--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

   [Hadden guards the entrance to the hut as Teal'c approaches.]

     HADDEN
     Teal'c, you all right?

     TEAL'C
     It is a light wound.

     HADDEN

     (gesturing to Teal'c)
     Lieutenant?
     (to Teal'c)
     What happened?

     TEAL'C
     I found Volnek.

     HAIKON
     Then you're lucky to be alive.

     TEAL'C
     Haikon!

   [Teal'c moves to Haikon's bedside and they clasp forearms in the Jaffa
   greeting. Teal'c stays by Haikon's side as McKensie treats Teal'c's
   wound. Haikon sits up half-way.]

     HAIKON
     Others were not so fortunate.

     HADDEN
     He woke up a few minutes ago.

     TEAL'C
     What has happened to Volnek?

     HAIKON
     Ten days ago, he went to a neighboring world to acquire supplies for
     our village.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--FIELD, UNKNOWN PLANET, DAY

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     On the way back to the Chappa'ai, he encountered a Prior.

   [Haikon, holding a staff weapon and rucksack, pauses as a Prior wearing
   dark robes approaches him. The Prior holds both an orbed staff and a
   Book of Origin.]

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     He was told that the Sodan had committed unforgivable treason
     against the Ori.

   [The Prior speaks to Volnek, then forcefully shoves his staff into the
   ground. The light from the orb flares. Volnek collapses to his knees,
   clearly in pain.]

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     The Prior vowed that great ill would befall us, and then planted his
     staff into the ground.

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     Volnek returned to the village and told me of the encounter.

   [Sodan go about their daily activities. Volnek and another warrior spar
   in the training ring.]

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     We took the threat seriously, keeping a watchful eye on the
     Chappa'ai. Several days passed without incident until...Volnek fell
     ill.

   [Volnek gets the better of the other warrior, but then collapses to his
   knees, breathing heavily and drooling.]

     HAIKON

     (voiceover)
     He became irrational, incoherent. We isolated him and treated him
     with our best medicines. But his condition worsened.

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

   [Some Sodan look inside a hut. One is a girl pulled away by her
   mother.]

   INT--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

   [Inside the hut, one warrior wipes at Volnek's brow while another holds
   down his feet. Volnek's arms are tied to the cot. He froths at the
   mouth, and his eyes are wild, like he has contracted rabies. He snarls
   with deep animalistic growls.]

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

     HAIKON

     (breathing laboriously)
     Yesterday, he broke the bonds that were meant to restrain him. Our
     finest warriors attempted to subdue him, but he killed them all with
     very little effort. He then turned on everyone in sight. His own
     brother, Jolan, was killed in the carnage that followed. Women and
     children fled to the woods, and Volnek followed them and slaughtered
     them all without mercy. To the best of my knowledge, I am the only
     one to have survived.

   [Haikon tries to sit up better, but is too weak. Teal' pushes him to
   lie back down. McKensie continues to bandage Teal'c's arm. Hadden has
   listened to the story with concern.]

     TEAL'C
     Rest, brother, rest.

   [Haikon falls back to the cot.]

     REYNOLDS

     (from outside)
     SG-22, establish defensive perimeter.

   [Teal'c and Hadden are startled.]

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844 DAY

   [SG-3, SG-22, and Mitchell enter the village, looking around warily.]

     REYNOLDS

     (continuing)
     SG-3, stick close to me.

   [SG-3 raises their weapons at movement by a hut. Teal'c and Hadden
   exit, their own weapons raised. Both sides lower their guns as they
   recognize their comrades.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Reynolds.

     REYNOLDS
     Teal'c, what the hell happened here? Why haven't you checked in?

     TEAL'C
     The Eye of the Gods had been damaged.

     HADDEN
     We're trapped here. So are you.

     TEAL'C
     The Ori had a hand in what has transpired here.

     REYNOLDS
     The Ori?

     TEAL'C
     We have much to discuss. Come.

   [Mitchell looks grave and slowly follows the others into the hut.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

     LEE
     Okay, if you're still there, I've given it some thought and my guess
     is, it should be a simple matter of reversing the process. I'm on
     it.

   [Lee moves back to his own computer.]

     DANIEL

     Is that supposed to be reassuring?
     (he looks at Lee, then looks around)
     Where's Mitchell?

     CARTER
     He went offworld with the extraction team.

     DANIEL
     What?!?

     CARTER
     He was convinced he could help Teal'c. I couldn't talk him out of
     it.

     DANIEL

     (snarkily)
     Why doesn't that surprise me?

     CARTER
     There's no sense in worrying about that now. On the bright side, the
     translation will go a lot quicker now that you're here.

   [Carter gives Daniel a bright, false grin. He returns it with a false
   smile of his own and a resigned shrug. Daniel then moves to the
   projection and studies it.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, this is interesting. It appears to be a log of some kind.
     Merlin was conducting research on some kind of new invention.

   [Daniel raises his finger to one of the symbols, and the display
   changes. He touches it again to read more text.]

     DANIEL

     And it was something big.
     (he changes the display again)
     He went to great lengths to try and hide it. This device was
     invented for the sole purpose of keeping his research a secret. He
     needed a way to conceal it from...

   [Daniel continues to change the display. His voice trails off, and he
   studies the text intently.]

     CARTER
     Daniel? Merlin needed to conceal his research from...?

     DANIEL
     His fellow ascended beings.

   [Carter stares at Daniel in shock. He glances at her before continuing
   to read different displays.]

     CARTER
     But if he was ascended, he must have retaken human form to perform
     his research. I--I don't get it. What research could have been so
     important that it would have led him to give up his ascension?

     DANIEL
     A weapon. A weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.

   [Carter stares at the display in surprise and takes a deep breath.]

   EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

   [Hadden and Teal'c stand by a cart. Reynolds approaches. Other SG team
   members patrol the perimeter.]

     REYNOLDS
     You hit him with two P-90s, and he didn't die. How is that possible?

     TEAL'C
     We have encountered something like this before. An Ancient device
     capable of reanimating dead tissue. Anubis used a similar technology
     to give life to his Kull Warriors.

     HADDEN
     I'm assuming there's no cure.

     TEAL'C
     The Volnek we knew is dead.

     REYNOLDS
     So how do we stop him...it...whatever?

     TEAL'C
     By destroying the body entirely.

     HADDEN
     Claymores.

   [Mitchell has been standing by Teal'c's side, listening to the whole
   conversation.]

     MITCHELL
     Ooh, that's what I'm talking about!

     HADDEN
     We just plant two of them opposite each other, and run a trip wire
     right through the middle. Then all we gotta do is lure him in.

     REYNOLDS

     (sarcastically)
     Piece of cake. While we're at it, maybe we can teach him how to
     speak Japanese.

     TEAL'C
     I will do it.

     MITCHELL
     What?

     REYNOLDS
     Teal'c, the kill zone is going to be huge. You're going to have to
     be awful quick to get out of it.

     TEAL'C
     Understood.

     MITCHELL
     No, no. Now, that's just crazy.

     HADDEN
     Let's at least wait for reinforcements.

     TEAL'C
     Waiting will only put the lives of others at risk. Volnek was clever
     enough to disable the Eye of the Gods. Undoubtedly the missing
     crystal is in his possession. The only way we can return to Earth is
     to retrieve it. And the only way that we can do that is by killing
     Volnek. There is no other way.

   [Teal'c grabs his weapons and leaves. Mitchell spins around in a circle
   and follows him, clearly annoyed.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Lee moves over to study the device before heading back to his
   computer. Carter watches him as Daniel stays focused on the Ancient
   display.]

     DANIEL
     Merlin believed that the Ori represented a significant threat to the
     safety of this galaxy, including the Ancients themselves, who
     refused to take any action to protect themselves against them.

     CARTER
     So he went ahead and developed the weapon anyway?

     DANIEL
     Well, he found a way of doing it without their knowing about it by
     shifting his research to another dimension.

     CARTER
     So, the weapon. Did--did he ever complete it?

   [Daniel changes the display.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, see, this is all technical--way over my head. I wish you
     understood Ancient. These notes seem to indicate he completed the
     weapon here on Earth and then had to relocate it to...

   [Daniel pauses and presses a symbol on the display. It changes to a new
   display with seven Stargate glyphs appearing amongst the Ancient text.]

     CARTER

     (brightening)
     I don't need to know Ancient to understand what that is.

     DANIEL
     A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [An airman hides a claymore under some foliage, checking the trip wire.
   Another airman does the same on the opposite side of the wire with
   another claymore. He rises and nods to Reynolds.]

     REYNOLDS
     Claymores are ready.

   [Teal'c and Mitchell stand nearby.]

     TEAL'C
     You and your men establish a perimeter. I will lead Volnek into the
     trap.

     REYNOLDS
     You sure you want to do this?

     TEAL'C
     I am.

   [Teal'c walks away, Mitchell following. Reynolds watches Teal'c go with
   concern.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

     LEE
     Okay.

   [He glances over to where his friends must be, then huffs when he
   realizes he can't see them anyway. Daniel continues to read different
   displays as Carter glances skeptically over to Lee.]

     LEE
     Um, I'm going to try to make an adjustment to the algorithm. It's a
     bit of a long shot, but if I can get this to sync up, hmm.

   [Lee presses the "Enter" key on his laptop. A clunking noise is heard
   and the projection display Daniel has been reading starts to shift
   erratically.]

     DANIEL AND CARTER
     Uh-oh.

     LEE

     (half a second later)
     Uh-oh.

   [Daniel and Carter spin around and look at Lee.]

     LEE

     (panicking)
     Oh, no.

   [Lee fumbles for a minute with his keyboard before picking up the phone
   and dialing an extension, clearly nervous.]

     LEE

     (into phone)
     Um, hello. This is Doctor Lee. I, um, I'd like to speak with General
     Landry, please. Yeah, it's a bit of an emergency.

   [Carter and Daniel slump in resignation.]

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Teal'c cautiously moves through the forest, weapons at ready. Mitchell
   strolls behind him.]

     MITCHELL
     You know, there's a fine line between crazy-brave and crazy-crazy,
     my friend, and you are walking it. You realize he took out an entire
     Sodan village?

   [Teal'c pauses behind a tree and activates the cloaking device.
   Teal'c's perspective shifts to the monochromatic vision of the cloak.
   He starts moving purposefully forward, Mitchell sullenly following.]

     MITCHELL
     You know, the last thing I need is for you to get yourself killed.
     Do you realize how long it'll take me to find a replacement?

     TEAL'C

     (calmly)
     You worry far too much, Colonel Mitchell.

   [Mitchell is startled. He moves directly in front of Teal'c.]

     MITCHELL
     Wha--? You can hear me now?

   [Teal'c glances directly at Mitchell before moving past him.]

     TEAL'C

     (stoic)
     And see you.

     MITCHELL

     (following, still shocked)
     You're not surprised?

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Landry enters the lab.]

     LANDRY

     (worried)
     What is it? What's going on?

     LEE
     I'm not sure, but I may have, accidentally, drained a significant
     portion of the machine's power supply.

     LANDRY
     How significant?

   [Daniel and Carter listen with concern.]

     LEE
     According to these readings, it--it could reach critical failure
     inside fifteen minutes.

     LANDRY
     And what happens to Carter, Mitchell, and Daniel?

     CARTER

     (to Daniel)
     In all likelihood, we'll be permanently stranded.

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [A cloaked Teal'c and out of phase Mitchell walk through the forest.]

     MITCHELL
     So, we can see each other when you're cloaked. That means, if
     Volnek's cloaked, he'll be able to see me. All I've got to do is get
     his attention and lead him right back to Reynolds.

     TEAL'C
     I do not feel comfortable allowing you to shoulder all the risk.

     MITCHELL
     No risk. I'm out of phase, remember?

   [Teal'c pauses and looks at Mitchell.]

     TEAL'C
     And you are certain you will not be injured?

     MITCHELL
     Absolutely. Hey, take your best shot if you don't--

   [Mitchell is interrupted by Teal'c slamming his arm, still holding the
   P-90, through Mitchell's head. It passes through harmlessly, though
   would have seriously injured Mitchell if it was able to make contact.]

     TEAL'C

     (bowing)
     Good luck, Colonel Mitchell.

   [Teal'c moves off to take cover.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, did you even think twice about that?

     TEAL'C

     (calling back)
     I did not.

     MITCHELL
     Huh.

   [Mitchell moves off into the other direction, jogging through the
   forest. Mitchell sees the forest in the vibrant colors of this
   dimension.]

     MITCHELL
     Volnek! Hey, Volnek!

   [Mitchell looks around, but sees nothing.]

     MITCHELL
     Volnek! Where are you, homeboy? Come on out and show me some of
     those monster moves!

   [The cloaked Volnek, moves from behind a tree, growling slightly. The
   forest and Mitchell appear in his monochromatic vision.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, there you are. I was getting worried.

   [The zombie Volnek aims his staff weapon and fires at Mitchell. The
   blast passes right through Mitchell's chest and strikes the tree behind
   him. Mitchell clutches his chest for a moment, then smiles and shrugs.
   Volnek tilts his head, confused.]

     MITCHELL
     Sorry, you gotta do better than that.

   [Mitchell runs off. Volnek follows.]

     MITCHELL

     (still running)
     Come on, big fella!

   [Volnek pauses and fires his weapon again. It misses Mitchell every
   time. Mitchell continues to run through the forest, passing through
   trees on occasion. He arrives at the stump where the claymore is hidden
   and pauses in front of it. Teal'c watches from behind a tree and hides
   himself further. Volnek appears and Mitchell beckons him in a taunting
   manner.]

     MITCHELL

     (in Southern accent)
     There you go. Come on, and get you some.

   [Volnek growls and fires his staff weapon several times. They all pass
   through Mitchell and strike the stump behind him. Teal'c observes this
   worriedly. Mitchell grins as Volnek growls in frustration.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Landry and Lee study Lee's monitor. Daniel reads the Ancient display.]

     CARTER
     We're running out of time.

     DANIEL
     Okay, I think I've got it. This looks like some sort of master
     control screen. Yeah, here it is. It's a--it's a button combination.

   [Daniel's fingers hover over the keyboard, about to depress the keys
   before he curls them back hesitantly.]

     DANIEL
     If this works, what happens to Mitchell?

     CARTER
     I don't know. I mean, it's possible there's still a subspace
     connection linking him to the device.

     DANIEL
     And if there isn't?

   [Carter furrows her brow and looks away. Daniel sighs.]

     LANDRY

     (to Lee)
     Doctor!

   [Daniel shakes his head and starts pressing the keys.]

     LEE
     Okay, I'm going to try to make an adjustment to the algorithm. It's
     a bit of a long shot--

     LANDRY

     (ominous)
     You better be sure about this, Doctor, because if you make me
     disappear, there won't be a dimension safe enough for you.

   [Lee gulps and nods. Both Lee and Daniel press buttons on their
   respective keypads. Daniel and Lee both press the final key at the same
   time. Landry sees a blinding white light near the device, and Carter
   and Daniel appear, wincing from the flash. They turn towards Lee and
   Landry with equally nervous and hopeful expressions.]

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Mitchell pats his legs as if calling a dog to him.]

     MITCHELL
     Come on, don't give up. Come on! Come on!

   [Volnek starts to move forward. Mitchell turns to run past the trip
   wire, but pauses, wincing as a bright light surrounds him. He stumbles
   and grabs onto the tree stump for support. Teal'c watches with
   concern.]

   [The forest appears the vibrant color of this dimension as Mitchell
   regains his footing. He looks at his hand. It clutches a piece of bark
   that he broke off, and Mitchell realizes he's now back in the proper
   dimension.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, crap.

   [Mitchell spins around, but he is no longer able to see the cloaked
   Volnek.]

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Landry and Lee smile in relief at seeing Daniel and Carter. Landry
   slaps Lee on the shoulder and moves towards the pair. Lee chuckles and
   turns to his laptop.]

     LANDRY
     You did it!

   [Carter pokes Daniel hard. Daniel shoves her back.]

     LEE

     (studying computer monitor, puzzled)
     No, actually I didn't.

     CARTER
     It was Daniel. He figured it out.

   [Daniel shrugs and gives a self-deprecating smile.]

     LANDRY

     (looking around)
     Where's Colonel Mitchell?

     DANIEL AND CARTER
     Oh.

   EXT--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

   [Mitchell turns to run, but is blocked by an invisible force knocking
   him to the ground. Before he can rise, Volnek lifts him by the throat.
   Mitchell reaches out and gauges where Volnek's head should be, then
   punches out with his fist, connecting several times. Teal'c starts to
   move forward. Volnek tosses Mitchell aside. Mitchell lands in a
   crumpled heap by the stump. Volnek aims his staff weapon, but Teal'c
   shoves the weapon aside.]

   [Volnek and Teal'c trade blows. Teal'c knocks Volnek back and fires
   several times with his P-90s. Volnek is rocked back, stunned. Teal'c
   drops his weapons and deactivates the cloak. He helps Mitchell up. They
   both run, carefully avoiding the trip wire. Volnek recovers from the
   gunshots and starts to run after them. He triggers the trip wire and
   the claymores explode. Mitchell and Teal'c are knocked flat to the
   ground from the concussion of the explosion. They slowly get up,
   stunned and sore.]

     MITCHELL

     (breathing heavy)
     You know, the whole point of my coming here was for me to rescue
     you.

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     You are most welcome, Colonel Mitchell.

   [They both stand and look back at the smoke.]

     MITCHELL
     Now, let's see him get up from that one.

     TEAL'C
     Mmm. Unfortunately, we must now locate the crystal.

     MITCHELL
     What, you talking about this crystal?

   [Mitchell holds up the crystal. Teal'c smiles and nods in
   satisfaction.]

     MITCHELL
     I took it off him during the fight. You know, if we hurry, we'll
     make it in time for dinner.

   [Mitchell and Teal'c walk back through the forest.]

   FADE OUT
