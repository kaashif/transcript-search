TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--VOLCANIC PLANET COVERED IN ASH, WITH MORE FALLING
[The view pans across towards a Stargate which is in the process of
opening. The four members of SG-1 come through.]
CARTER
Wow! None of this was going on when we sent the probe through.
DANIEL
What's this stuff in the air?
[View of volcano erupting.]
TEAL'C
Ash.
O'NEILL
All right, Daniel. Dial it up, get us out of here.
DANIEL
No argument.
[Daniel walks towards the DHD but sees something in the near distance.]
DANIEL
Wait a minute.
[Daniel takes a closer look.]
DANIEL
There's something out there.
[The team turn to look as Daniel reaches the object which caught his
eye.]
DANIEL
It's a woman, she's alive. There's more--hurry you guys.
[Daniel kneels at the woman's side as O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c check
other bodies.]
TEAL'C
There's no life here.
CARTER
This one's had it.
[Daniel brushes ash from the face of one of the victims.]
DANIEL
It's just like Pompeii. Everyone died of suffocation before the lava
started to flow.
[As O'Neill checks another body, Daniel notices unusual objects
attached to the alien's arm.]
DANIEL
What are these things?
TEAL'C
O'Neill! There are two more alive.
O'NEILL
Carter? How long before we're toast?
CARTER
I don't know, Sir, I'm not a vulcanologist. It could be days, it
could be minutes.
[One of the victims raises his head. Carter goes to check his pulse and
he grabs her wrist.]
VICTIM
(in a broken voice)
Don't...help us.
FADE OUT
END OF TEASER--OPENING CREDITS
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[SG-1 and medical teams help victims down the ramp.]
UNKNOWN VOICE
Move away. Give them some room.
O'NEILL
All right. Let's go.
MEDIC
You OK?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[Hammond comes up to the team as O'Neill and Carter sit on the ramp.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill? What happened?
O'NEILL
(breathless)
We encountered some very severe volcanic activity, Sir.
[Hammond turns to Daniel who is rubbing his left eye.]
HAMMOND
Who are all these people?
CARTER
We don't really know, Sir They were all dead and dying around the
Gate. The air was highly toxic.
DANIEL
And hot.
HAMMOND
You better have Doctor Frasier take a look at you. We'll de-brief as
soon as you're ready.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
HAMMOND
You evacuated ten people from an alien planet, Colonel. Doctor
Frasier says they're all human and it looks like they're going to
live. This was one hell of a rescue operation.
O'NEILL
Thank you, Sir.
HAMMOND
There were no buildings in the area of any kind?
CARTER
No sir. We don't know how far they walked, but it looked like they
were trying to make it back to the Stargate.
HAMMOND
What do we know about these devices they were wearing?
CARTER
Well, they all emit low levels of radiation indicating an operative
energy source, but there's no circuitry, moving parts or chips.
We've never seen anything like it.
DANIEL
I thought at first that they were from a parallel culture but it
looks like they might be way ahead of us.
HAMMOND
We've determined humans on other planets originated here on Earth,
right?
DANIEL
Yes.
HAMMOND
Then given our present state of technology, could they be ahead of
us?
DANIEL
Yes. Umm...we'd be colonising space right now if it hadn't been for
the Dark Ages. There was a period of over eight hundred years where
science was heresy and anathema. Maybe they didn't have that
set-back.
[An airwoman enters.]
AIRWOMAN
General Hammond? The spokesperson for the rescued people is awake.
He'd like to speak with you. All of you.
INT--INFIRMARY
UNKNOWN VOICE over intercom
Attention. All off duty medical personnel report to the infirmary,
sub level 20. Stat.
[Hammond and the team enter and walk towards a bed.]
OMOC
Who are you?
HAMMOND
I'm Major General Hammond. This is Colonel O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Jack.
CARTER
Samantha Carter.
DANIEL
Uh...Daniel Jackson.
OMOC
Where is this place?
HAMMOND
You're on a planet called Earth. These people saved you.
OMOC
Nothing could be further from the truth.
[Hammond looks over at O'Neill, surprised at the comment.]
DANIEL
Well, unless I missed something, you're...better off here than you
were there.
OMOC
There was a rescue transport on the way.
O'NEILL
Well, half your people were already dead. I don't think it would
have gotten there in time.
OMOC
Perhaps that's more of a problem for you than it was for us.
O'NEILL
Beg your pardon?
OMOC
I find it unbelievable that anyone so primitive could have
deciphered the Gate system.
O'NEILL
Did you say primitive?
TEAL'C
I too am from a world very different from this one. Here life is
highly valued.
OMOC
Quite a statement for a Jaffa.
HAMMOND
Sir, I'd like to know who you are and what you know about the
Goa'uld.
OMOC
I am Omoc. Our world is called Tollan.
HAMMOND
And what do you know of the Goa'uld and Jaffa?
OMOC
We're aware of them; we don't interact with them.
HAMMOND
Well then, we share a common enemy.
OMOC
Did I mention an enemy?
HAMMOND
I only meant...it might benefit everyone if your people and ours
could be friends.
OMOC
I demand you return everything that you have taken from us and allow
us to go home.
DANIEL
Well, it could take a while for those volcanoes to quiet down. In
the meantime, I'm a bit of a culture buff, I'd like to learn about
your history and customs.
OMOC
I've said enough. I'll say no more.
[Hammond and the team exit, but an alien in another bed looks over and
holds Carter's gaze.]
INT--BASE CORRIDOR
HAMMOND
Captain Carter, I want you to monitor the situation on Tollan very
closely, as soon as it's safe there, I want those people gone.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
INT--STARGATE ROOM.
[Daniel enters and joins Carter at the foot of the ramp where she is
fine-tuning an UAV.]
DANIEL
New hobby?
CARTER
Neat, huh? Miniature UAV with all the bells and whistles. I'm just
adding heat sensors so I can send it through the Gate to Tollan.
DANIEL
Hm. I was just down in the infirmary with one of the Tollan, trying
to get them to talk to us. They only ask questions, they never
answer them. As a matter of fact, one of them was asking a lot of
questions about you.
CARTER
I thought they weren't interested in us.
DANIEL
Oohh...I didn't say us. I said you. General Hammond thinks maybe
you'll have better luck getting some answers. He'd like to see you.
CARTER
OK.
INT--BASE CORRIDOR
[Hammond and Carter appear round the corner.]
HAMMOND
And I was hoping he would open up to you a bit more than Doctor
Jackson or myself.
[They walk towards one of the aliens sitting outside the Infirmary.]
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
You remember Narim?
CARTER
Yes. From the planet. You were...uh...a lot dirtier then.
NARIM
Oh...Captain Carter, or is it Doctor?
CARTER
Why don't we just make it Samantha?
NARIM
You may call me Narim.
CARTER
OK.
HAMMOND
Captain Carter, Mr Narim seems very interested in our planet. I
thought maybe you'd like to escort him up to the surface to have a
look.
CARTER
Really?
NARIM
I would be very pleased to have that opportunity.
HAMMOND
As long as you give me your word you'll stay with Captain Carter.
NARIM
You have my word.
CARTER
Great! Let's go. Sir.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Carter and Narim step out of a doorway, followed by security
personnel. They start walking.]
NARIM
Umm...I wanted to tell you, that I'm glad to be alive. Ummm...so are
the others.
CARTER
Good.
NARIM
Thank you. And please tell your friends.
CARTER
Oh. You...you can tell them yourself.
NARIM
No, I can't. I shouldn't be talking to you.
CARTER
Why not?
NARIM
You know, back on Tollan, I thought I was dying. I heard your voice
and managed to open my eyes, and, uh...when I saw you...uh.
CARTER
What?
NARIM
An old superstition. There was a time before reason and science when
my ancestors believed in all manner of nonsense. Like the Sher'mau.
The story goes that if a Sher'mau appears at the moment of death,
she would take you to her dwelling in the stars.
CARTER
Ah! We call them angels.
NARIM
Than you still believe in them?
CARTER
Some of us do.
NARIM
Ours were reported to be quite beautiful...and, when I saw
you...well...you seemed to fit the description.
[Carter and Narim both smile.]
NARIM
And then I learned from Doctor Jackson that you're also a brilliant
scientist.
CARTER
Wow!
NARIM
I'm afraid I ask quite a few questions. Curiosity.
CARTER
It's a quality Omoc doesn't seem to share.
NARIM
Can you tell me something about your world? Is it permitted?
CARTER
Well, yeah. Of course.
[Narim spots a bird flying overhead and appears amazed. Carter is
amused at his amazement.]
NARIM
A flying animal.
CARTER
Yeah. We call them birds.
NARIM
Are there other animals?
CARTER
Oh yeah. Millions of them.
NARIM
Huh. There have been none on Tollan for generations.
CARTER
Well, I could bring you pictures, if you like.
NARIM
I would like that very much. Thank you.
CARTER
Good.
NARIM
But, I think it would be best if Omoc didn't know.
CARTER
Why?
NARIM
Omoc is not as harsh as he seems. He is only trying to protect us.
And you.
CARTER
From what?
NARIM
Perhaps...
Narim looks towards the two security officers and pauses.
NARIM
Perhaps we should go back.
CARTER
OK.
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[The Stargate sequence is being initiated.]
CHEVRON GUY
Chevron six. Engaged.
[A scientist is preparing an UAV for launch.]
CHEVRON GUY
Chevron seven. Locked.
CARTER
Launching UAV in 10 seconds...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1
[The UAV launches through the Stargate's wormhole.]
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Yeah!
CARTER
Successful launch. UAV is holding course and the wormhole should
reach the Tollan Gate in...3...2...1. Temperature--ground 1700
degrees Fahrenheit. Air--seems to be in pockets, ranging from 1500
degrees down to 200.
O'NEILL
Sounds like LA.
CARTER
If the heat doesn't get you, the atmosphere will. It's mostly
pyroclastics, basalt, ash. A person could suffocate very quickly.
O'NEILL
How long before it cools down?
CARTER
I don't know. Not any time soon. It doesn't look like it'll matter,
anyway. That lava's flowing straight toward the Gate. Computer
predicts that at the current rate the Gate will be buried in a
couple of days.
O'NEILL
Well, looks like we've got some guests for a while.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Daniel and Carter are standing by Omoc's bedside.]
OMOC
Are you absolutely certain?
CARTER
Yes. I'm sorry.
OMOC
Then nature succeeded where we failed.
DANIEL
What? You were going to seal the Gate?
OMOC
Tollan is a world in cataclysm. Evacuation was complete, my team
stayed to...Our final task was to close the Gate, so that no-one
could return and be harmed.
CARTER
Well, wherever you were going, we can recalibrate the co-ordinates
from here.
OMOC
The new settlement world is outside the Gate system. We'll need a
ship.
DANIEL
Oh! Ah...we don't have ships. Not that kind, anyway.
CARTER
Our space program is relatively new.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM.
HAMMOND
Well, the bottom line here is your survivors have become refugees.
If they don't want to be here, we've got to relocate them somewhere.
O'NEILL
You know, General, we have done some fairly good deeds out there.
Maybe we should try calling in some markers.
HAMMOND
OK. Colonel, you and Teal'c follow up on that. Maybe go pay a visit
to some of our old friends. Captain Carter, I want you and Doctor
Jackson to get the multi-purpose room on 5C readied as a refugee
housing centre.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
[Hammond, Omoc and Daniel enter.]
HAMMOND
As an act of good faith, we're returning the devices you were
wearing.
OMOC
They are not weapons.
HAMMOND
That's what our technicians thought.
OMOC
So you had them tested? Not much of an act of good faith.
DANIEL
Well, actually, we couldn't figure out exactly what they were.
HAMMOND
I want to assure you, we're doing all we can to re-locate your
people.
OMOC
Are we to have some say in the matter?
DANIEL
Oh, yes. Self-determination is a concept that's very important to
us.
HAMMOND
We'll do our best. In the meantime, we'll make you as comfortable as
possible, but I want you to understand, you're restricted to the
immediate premises.
OMOC
Are we prisoners?
DANIEL
No. No, absolutely not.
HAMMOND
But you are from an alien environment. It's as much for your safety
as for ours.
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
[The centre is now divided into areas, holding bunk beds. Carter enters
carrying books and an animal carrier, and walks towards Narim.]
CARTER
Hey. How you doing.
NARIM
Um...it may sound ridiculous, but I have no idea what to do with
these items.
[Narim holds up bed linen.]
NARIM
Oh...well, our sleeping platforms adjust automatically to our body
temperature. They don't...come with accoutrements.
CARTER
It's OK. I'll show you. I brought you some things to take a look at.
[Narim accepts the books.]
NARIM
Oh! Thank you.
CARTER
You're welcome. Uh...you...you might like to see this first.
[Carter places the animal carrier on the bed and opens it, bringing out
a ginger cat which miaows. Narim laughs.]
NARIM
I never thought I'd see a living animal.
CARTER
His name's Schroedinger.
[Carter passes the cat to Narim who holds it in his arms.]
CARTER
Oh...it's kind of a joke really. His name, that is. Schroedinger's
cat...
NARIM
Oh?
CARTER
Right.
(Carter realizes that Narim does not understand)
Uh, see, there was an Earth physicist by the name of Erwin
Schroedinger. He had this theoretical experiment. Put a cat in a
box, add a can of poison gas, activated by the decay of a
radioactive atom, and close the box.
[Narim continues to pet the cat.]
NARIM
Sounds like a cruel man.
CARTER
Oh, no, no. It was just a theory. He never really did it. He said
that if he did do it at any one instant, the cat would be both dead
and alive at the same time.
NARIM
Ah! Kulivrian physics. An atom state is indeterminate until measured
by an outside observer.
CARTER
We call it quantum physics. You know the theory?
NARIM
Yeah, I've studied it...in among other misconceptions of elementary
science.
CARTER
Misconception? You telling me that you guys have licked quantum
physics?
[Omoc joins Carter and Narim.]
NARIM
Omoc.
CARTER
Uh...I'll come back and help you with this later.
[Carter leaves.]
NARIM
I did not tell her anything.
INT--STAIRS TO BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter the room by the stairs.]
O'NEILL
We set up a meeting with Tuplo for 08:00 tomorrow.
[Carter and Daniel are sitting at the briefing room table.]
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill was correct. Many of the worlds we have visited are
eager to be of service.
[Hammond enters.]
HAMMOND
People! We have a problem. The refugees seem to have escaped.
CARTER
Escaped?
O'NEILL
How did they get past the guards.
HAMMOND
You can ask them that when you find them.
EXT--NIGHTIME
[A search dog leads the team through woodland.]
UNKNOWN VOICE
They're over here.
O'NEILL
Hold fire.
[The refugees are together in a group, not running. Omoc walks towards
O'Neill.]
OMOC
We were merely observing the stars.
O'NEILL
Well, you're all going to have to come back in now.
OMOC
So we are prisoners.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
Any idea how they got past the guards, Sir?
[Carter is standing behind Hammond.]
HAMMOND
None. A surveillance video in the multi-purpose room was exposed to
some sort of interference, just as the escape was taking place.
O'NEILL
Convenient.
CARTER
Can the video be salvaged, maybe computer enhanced?
HAMMOND
We're trying now. In the meantime, we should get this show on the
road.
[They exit the office into the briefing room. Two aliens sitting at the
table rise. Omoc, Daniel and Teal'c are also at the table.]
O'NEILL
Tuplo.
[O'Neill shakes Tuplo's hand.]
TUPLO
Good to see you. General Hammond, before we begin, I wish to thank
you for allowing me to be the first visitor to your Earth from the
Land of Light. It is indeed an honour.
[Hammond, O'Neill and Carter sit.]
TUPLO
My lord Omoc, the Land of Light is a world of eternal brightness,
where fertility abounds. Our farms produce rich harvests. Our rivers
are blessed with fish and fowl. We would be honoured to share our
land with your people.
OMOC
You have no idea who or what we are.
[Hammond and Tuplo look surprised.]
TUPLO
We know that you are in need, and that you are here among those who
have proven themselves our friends. That is enough.
OMOC
You're missing the point.
[Omoc rises.]
OMOC
(to Hammond)
His planet is unacceptable to us. These people are even more
primitive than you.
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
[Schroedinger is on a bed, being petted.]
CARTER
Narim...can you tell me why Omoc is so...you know...
NARIM
Obstinate?
CARTER
Yeah...
NARIM
The nearest planet in our solar system was called Sureeta. When we
began to explore space, we learned she was inhabited.
CARTER
Did you make contact?
NARIM
Yes, when we thought they were sufficiently advanced. They were on a
level very similar to yours.
CARTER
So what happened?
NARIM
We offered them a device...to produce unlimited productive energy.
And they used it to make war.
CARTER
How bad was it?
NARIM
In one rotation of our planet, they had destroyed theirs.
CARTER
One day?
NARIM
The destruction shifted our planet's orbit point 3 tekanna, enough
to begin a chain of events that...made our world unstable.
CARTER
So that would explain why he's so afraid to give a society like ours
any of your technology.
NARIM
Yes.
CARTER
Tell me, what...what were you really doing outside last night.
NARIM
Omoc spoke the truth. By setting the position of your stars, we were
able to calibrate the distance between Earth and the new homeworld.
It is very far away, Samantha. Too far to hope for a ship in our
lifetime.
CARTER
Have you ever thought about staying here? On earth?
NARIM
I would...gladly stay, if only to spend more time with a certain
inhabitant of this planet. I speak, of course, of Schroedinger.
[Both laugh.]
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
[The room contains the Tollan, plus Omoc and SG-1.]
OMOC
Our escape was a test. You did exactly what I knew you would do. You
used threat and force to solve your problem.
CARTER
You didn't give us any other choice.
OMOC
You could have come for us unarmed.
O'NEILL
Hey! You haven't exactly behaved like someone I want to trust. I'm
not going to put my team at risk.
OMOC
And I will not risk my people in your care.
O'NEILL
Look...Omoc. If you're so advanced, why don't you let your people
decide for themselves?
CARTER
Narim, this is a free country. Every year we take in thousands of
refugees fleeing repression. If you request asylum, you can stay
here no matter what Omoc wants.
OMOC
You don't care anything about Narim's rights. You only want our
technology, nothing more.
O'NEILL
As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind knowing how you got the hell
out of this place. Technically speaking, of course.
OMOC
You don't need to know how, only that we did, and we can do it again
any time we need to.
[Airwoman enters.]
AIRWOMAN
Colonel, General Hammond would like to see you and your team right
away, Sir.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[SG-1 exit.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Chevron Man works at a computer keyboard.]
CHEVRON MAN
We've managed to augment the surveillance video from the
multi-purpose room and some of the corridors...with computer
enhancement. You're not going to believe this.
[A monitor shows the Tollan disappearing through the multi-purpose room
walls.]
O'NEILL
Wow! Cool!
DANIEL
But totally impossible.
CARTER
Well, only from the perspective of our limited science, apparently.
CHEVRON MAN
We have similar video of them passing through an elevator door and
wall, on ground level.
TEAL'C
This is knowledge far beyond that of the Goa'uld.
MAYBOURNE
That's exactly what the President and Joint Chiefs want to hear.
[Maybourne enters, with two other officers. Hammond and SG-1 turn to
him.]
MAYBOURNE
(saluting)
Colonel Maybourne, Sir. NID.
[Hammond salutes.]
O'NEILL
Intelligence? What happened to Kennedy?
MAYBOURNE
Promoted. I took his place.
O'NEILL
Promoted? Talk about failing upwards.
MAYBOURNE
Colonel O'Neill. I read about your conflict with Colonel Kennedy in
his report. I assure you, such an attitude will not prevail with me,
in either direction.
O'NEILL
I sense that.
MAYBOURNE
Good.
HAMMOND
Would you mind telling me exactly why you're here, Colonel.
MAYBOURNE
You didn't get my advance?
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 are sitting at the table. Maybourne places official papers before
Hammond.]
MAYBOURNE
That's an order releasing the Tollans to our section. You're to be
congratulated, General, the Stargate program is finally paying off.
This was...quite a coup.
DANIEL
Excuse me? These are people we're talking about.
O'NEILL
These people do have rights, you know?
MAYBOURNE
Do they? Under what nation's jurisdiction.
DANIEL
How about basic human rights?
HAMMOND
I can't release them to you.
MAYBOURNE
I beg your pardon?
HAMMOND
I don't believe the President meant to release these people until
they have been through quarantine. We don't have any idea what kinds
of diseases they might be carrying.
MAYBOURNE
You're out of your league here, gentlemen. You're playing in my
ballpark now, and I have the full authority of the President.
HAMMOND
So do I, Colonel. Why don't you ask the airman outside to show you
to our guest quarters?
MAYBOURNE
That's OK. I'll wait.
HAMMOND
That wasn't an invitation. It was an order, Colonel.
[Maybourne and the two officers exit.]
O'NEILL
General? Didn't Doctor Frasier give the Tollans a...clean bill of
health?
[Hammond smiles.]
HAMMOND
Just don't let her tell Maybourne that. At most, I've bought us a
day, people. Find me some alternatives.
O'NEILL
You're a good man, General.
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
[Narim places Schroedinger on a bed.]
NARIM
Then it doesn't matter how I ask for asylum?
CARTER
Maybourne would love that. But you'd be working for him, on his
terms.
NARIM
Then Omoc is correct. Your people will use our knowledge for war.
CARTER
It's not us. We are dealing with another part of our government, one
that specialises in chronic paranoia.
NARIM
Like Sureeta. It's going to happen again.
CARTER
It doesn't have to...that's why I am here. Narim, I am hoping that
you can convince Omoc to consider one of the other planets we've
presented.
NARIM
Look, it's no use. He's right. If they are all as primitive or more
primitive than you are, Sureeta could happen on any of them.
CARTER
I wish you would stop calling us primitive.
NARIM
I'm sorry. I only meant technologically. You are anything but
primitive, Samantha. What your mind doesn't know, your heart fills
in.
CARTER
I don't know what that means, exactly, but it's beautiful.
NARIM
Which is exactly what it means.
INT--VIEW OF HAMMOND'S OFFICE FROM THE BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond is speaking on a red phone. View moves to Maybourne in the
briefing room.]
DANIEL
Just what exactly do you hope to get from these people?
MAYBOURNE
Well, for one, superior weapons.
O'NEILL
They won't cooperate, you know.
MAYBOURNE
I assure you, Colonel, they will.
[Hammond enters from his office. Carter and O'Neill stand.]
HAMMOND
I just hung up from talking to the President. I guess Mr Maybourne
has been talking to him recently.
MAYBOURNE
I did tell you I had his ear, General.
HAMMOND
Colonel Maybourne has full authorisation to relocate the Tollans
immediately.
O'NEILL
Of course he does.
[Daniel rises from the table in disgust.]
TEAL'C
To where will you take them?
MAYBOURNE
To a secure community here in the Rockies.
[Daniel turns to Maybourne, clearly not happy with the situation.]
O'NEILL
Nice little community with high walls, guards, maybe a little barbed
wire.
MAYBOURNE
They're a valuable asset. They need to be protected.
DANIEL
Nice...forced intellectual labour.
CARTER
And life imprisonment.
MAYBOURNE
These aliens will live a better life than most Americans. They'll
have a great view, the best food, every convenience, everything they
need.
O'NEILL
Everything *except* a life.
DANIEL
You know...the Pentagon, intelligence, that I can understand, but
the President? I voted for him!
MAYBOURNE
Colonel, have the Tollans ready for transport at 0600 tomorrow.
[Maybourne and his officers exit.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Hammond exits to the outside and walks toward SG-1.]
HAMMOND
OK, Colonel, want to tell me why I'm here?
O'NEILL
Because Maybourne isn't, Sir.
CARTER
Sir, we wanted to talk to you about what we could do to keep
Maybourne from taking the Tollan.
TEAL'C
General, we must ensure the Tollans escape.
HAMMOND
I can't let you do that. We'd all be court martialled.
O'NEILL
General, I'm about a hair away from not caring. However, Daniel...
DANIEL
I can't be court martialled, Sir
INT--REFUGEE CENTRE
OMOC
(to Daniel)
The one you call Maybourne was here questioning my people, wanting
us to take some sort of tests. And you expect me to trust you?
DANIEL
Please. Maybourne is from another division of government. My group
is trying to protect you from him.
OMOC
Well, you're not doing a very good job.
DANIEL
No, apparently not.
OMOC
Do you have a new place for us to go?
DANIEL
Well...no.
OMOC
Then we have nothing else to say.
DANIEL
Well, OK...I do know of a perfect place you could go, I just don't
know how to get you there.
NARIM
Well, then, why do you speak of it.
DANIEL
Well, I was kind of hoping that maybe you'd have the technology to
get there.
OMOC
This is another trick to gain access to our technology.
DANIEL
No, no it isn't. Listen, there was a planet we went to where people
were as advanced as you, maybe even more advanced. They were called
the Nox.
OMOC
If you went there, why can't we?
DANIEL
Well...because...they felt about us kind of like you do.
They...called us very young, which I suppose is a hair more polite
than calling us primitive, but, same idea. Anyway, they sealed their
Stargate, and I don't know how to communicate with them to get it
open.
OMOC
Do you know where this planet is?
DANIEL
Yes, I have the coordinates right here.
[Daniel takes a notebook from his pocket.]
OMOC
Then we must go back to the mountaintop.
DANIEL
Really? Uh...I can't...I can't...I can't get you out of here.
OMOC
That's not a problem.
DANIEL
Right. Oh, but I have to go with you.
[Omoc looks around at the other Tollan. While Omoc is thinking, Narim
and Daniel appear concerned.]
OMOC
Give me your hand.
[Omoc raises his hand towards Daniel. Narim turns in surprise.]
DANIEL
What?
OMOC
Do you wish to come or not?
[Daniel grips Omoc's hand. Omoc touches a device on his arm, which
lights up. As he touches it, a shivering sound is heard and Omoc walks
through a wall, pulling Daniel with him.]
EXT--NIGHTTIME
[Omoc and Daniel are walking in the woods. Omoc stops to look up at the
star-filled sky.]
OMOC
The coordinates.
[Daniel takes the notebook out of his pocket and leafs through it. He
hands the notebook to Omoc. After studying the coordinates, Omoc
removes a device from his upper sleeve and places it on the ground.
Daniel sits on the ground as Omoc switches on the device. A beam of
light shoots upwards.]
DANIEL
Listen, I'm no astronomer, but won't that take thousands of years to
reach the Nox world?
OMOC
Why would it?
DANIEL
Well, that's just a laser, right? I mean...light takes a long time
to travel that far.
[Omoc looks to the sky, then picks up a branch.]
OMOC
The distance between these two points...
Omoc looks to both ends of the branch...
seems far. Until you do this.
[Omoc bends the branch to join the two ends together.]
DANIEL
OK...OK, I remember this from college physics. One of our
scientists, Einstein, explained this the same way. You are talking
about actually folding space.
OMOC
No. You wouldn't understand.
DANIEL
No, I guess not. I just hope the Nox do.
[Omoc and Daniel look to the stars.]
INT--LAB
[Carter is sitting at a terminal, entering data.]
NARIM'S VOICE
Samantha.
[Carter turns, puzzled.]
CARTER
Narim?
[Narim appears through a wall.]
NARIM
Hello.
[Carter appears amazed.]
CARTER
Oh my God, how did you do that?
NARIM
Very carefully.
[Both laugh.]
NARIM
I have come to say goodbye. We'll be leaving soon.
CARTER
So you think Daniel's plan will work?
NARIM
Either way, I will be leaving. However, I will go reluctantly.
CARTER
Why?
NARIM
Because, as of tonight, we will never meet again.
[Carter smiles.]
CARTER
Oh, come on, you'll forget about me in a heartbeat.
NARIM
I thought you felt that way.
[Narim removes a device from his sleeve.]
NARIM
That is why I brought you this.
CARTER
What is it?
[Narim has handed the device to Carter.]
NARIM
You have audio and visual recording devices, yes?
CARTER
Yeah.
NARIM
This one records emotions. My feelings for you. I have worn it each
time we were together.
[Carter looks at the device.]
CARTER
How does it work?
NARIM
Touch the red triangle...
[Carter touches the triangle, making the device light up.]
NARIM
(cont'd)
...and close your eyes.
[Carter closes her eyes. A puzzled look, followed by a smile crosses
her face. She appears touched by what she is feeling. She switches off
the device, and looks at Narim.]
CARTER
Uh...I don't know what to say.
NARIM
(emotional)
We have a custom...
[Narim steps nearer to Carter.]
NARIM
(cont'd)
...that expresses more than words.
[They lean towards each other and kiss.]
CARTER
We have that custom too.
[They kiss again. Daniel runs into the room and stops as he sees Narim
and Carter. They stop kissing and turn to Daniel.]
DANIEL
Oops! Uuhhh...sorry. I got to do some stuff in here.
DANIEL
(to Carter)
Actually, I need your help.
[Daniel turns away.]
CARTER
(to Narim)
You should probably get going. Don't forget Schroedinger.
[Narim smiles and gently touches Carter's cheek and chin as she closes
her eyes.]
NARIM
Thank you.
[Narim walks away. Carter joins Daniel, who is sitting at one of the
monitors.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
MAYBOURNE
Now, I'll need at least one unit of escorts in the rear transport...
[There is a knock at the door.]
HAMMOND
Come.
[An airwoman enters.]
AIRWOMAN
General Hammond. Sir. The refugees...they've disappeared.
MAYBOURNE
What do you mean, disappeared?
AIRWOMAN
I mean...like Poof! Sir. They went through the walls.
MAYBOURNE
I told you to keep guards inside the room to prevent that from
happening again.
AIRWOMAN
We were inside the room, Sir. I stood in their path myself.
MAYBOURNE
And?
AIRWOMAN
They went right...through me, Sir.
[An alarm sounds.]
UNKNOWN VOICE
(over the intercom)
Attention, all personnel. Off world activation. Unknown source.
[Hammond, Maybourne and the Airwoman exit.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and Maybourne enter.]
HAMMOND
What the hell's going on?
[Carter and the Chevron Guy are sitting at monitors. O'Neill is
standing alongside them.]
CHEVRON GUY
The mainframe's having a nervous breakdown. Now the iris is failing.
HAMMOND
Why is the blast door down? Get it up.
[The blast door rises, showing Daniel, Teal'c and the Tollan in the
Stargate room.]
MAYBOURNE
What are they doing. How did they get here?
CHEVRON GUY
Gate's dialling. Chevron six engaged.
MAYBOURNE
(into a microphone)
Doctor Jackson, this is Colonel Maybourne. What you're doing is a
court martiallable offence.
[Daniel places his hand to his ear, as though straining to hear
Maybourne.]
O'NEILL
He's not in the military, Colonel, and I think it'll be kind of
tough to find a civilian law to cover this.
MAYBOURNE
(into the microphone)
I'll have you removed from this program for ever if you do this.
CHEVRON GUY
Chevron seven is locked.
[The Stargate kawooshes.]
MAYBOURNE
Wherever you send them, we'll hunt them down.
CARTER
We're not sending them anywhere, Sir. The Gate was activated off
world. Someone is sending for them.
MAYBOURNE
Who?
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[Daniel, the Tollan and the SFs are looking at the Stargate. Lya walks
through. She stands at the head of the ramp and smiles. The Stargate
closes.]
LYA
Hello.
[Daniel makes his way up the ramp.]
DANIEL
Hello, Lya.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MAYBOURNE
All personnel in the Gate room. This is Colonel Maybourne. I have a
Presidential order to take the aliens with me. Do not let them pass.
Use force if necessary.
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[The SFs step forward, weapons raised.]
LYA
(to Daniel)
Your race has learned nothing. But you have. The Tollans are most
welcome to join the Nox. Please come.
[Omoc steps onto the ramp and up to Daniel.]
OMOC
Narim was right about you. Perhaps in time we'll meet again.
[The Tollan step onto the ramp. Narim, with Scroedinger in his arms,
turns to look at Carter.]
MAYBOURNE
Stop! Take one more step and I'll be forced to have them open fire.
[Lya shakes her head, closes her eyes and raises her arms. The Stargate
opens.]
LYA
Come.
[The Tollan disappear.]
MAYBOURNE
Fire! Fire!
[The weapons held by the SFs disappear. Lya backs into the Stargate and
leaves.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
God, I love those people.
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[Teal'c joins Daniel on the ramp. The Stargate closes.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Maybourne glares at Hammond/O'Neill and leaves. Hammond, O'Neill and
Carter exit.]
INT--STARGATE ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill and Carter enter. O'Neill and Carter join Daniel and
Teal'c on the ramp.]
DANIEL
You did good, Daniel.
TEAL'C
What of Maybourne?
CARTER
Oohh, he's not a happy camper.
HAMMOND
There'll be hell to pay when he gets back to Washington.
[O'Neill moves to stand next to Daniel.]
O'NEILL
(to Daniel)
What?
DANIEL
Oh, just thinking what the little guy with funny hair once told us.
O'NEILL
The very young do not always do as they're told.
[Daniel turns to O'Neill and smiles.]
DANIEL
Yeah.
[The four members of SG-1 stand in a line, looking at the Stargate.]
