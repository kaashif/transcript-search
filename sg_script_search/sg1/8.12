INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Daniel exit the Level 27 elevator and walk through the
corridor.]
DANIEL
(pleading and frustrated)
Come on, Jack!
O'NEILL
Still no, Daniel.
DANIEL
But, it doesn't have to be on a permanent basis.
O'NEILL
I didn't let you go in the first place. What makes you think I'm
gonna change my mind?
DANIEL
Because...
O'NEILL
Can you try to do better than that?
[Harriman hands O'Neill a clipboard with something for him to sign.]
DANIEL
Because they're going to need somebody who can translate Ancient.
I'm the most qualified person left on the planet for the mission.
O'NEILL
Which is exactly why you're gonna stay right here.
DANIEL
(desperate)
Because I'll quit!
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Why don't you just hold your breath? You haven't done that in a
while.
[They come to the entrance to O'Neill's office and see Hammond turn
around in O'Neill's chair to face them.]
O'NEILL
(very pleased)
General!
HAMMOND
Jack. I let myself in. Hope you don't mind.
O'NEILL
Absolutely not. Welcome.
HAMMOND
Thank you.
O'NEILL
(hopefully)
Miss the chair?
HAMMOND
Actually I do.
O'NEILL
Want it back?
HAMMOND
As a matter of fact, I do. My new one just isn't the same.
O'NEILL
That's not exactly what I meant.
HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson. Nice to see you again.
DANIEL
Likewise; we miss you around here, sir.
[O'Neill looks at him.]
DANIEL
So, to what do we owe this pleasure?
HAMMOND
I came to ask if you'd be interested in joining the mission to
Atlantis.
O'NEILL
DANIEL
(simultaneously)
You did?
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
He's the most qualified person on this planet, and the mission
commander needs someone who can translate Ancient.
DANIEL
Really.
O'NEILL
With all due respect sir, I think you should tell the mission
commander that I need Daniel right here.
HAMMOND
You just did.
O'NEILL
I did. I did?
(surprised)
You, sir?
HAMMOND
Yes. Request denied. Doctor Jackson, you're with me.
[Hammond stands up.]
HAMMOND
I'll have the chair shipped to Washington. You can requisition a new
one.
O'NEILL
(a bit shell-shocked)
I'll do that, sir.
HAMMOND
(to Daniel)
We leave tomorrow.
(to O'Neill)
Oh, and I'll be taking Walter, too.
[Hammond leaves the office. Daniel almost smiles but O'Neill looks at
him sternly. Daniel clears his throat and leaves. O'Neill looks annoyed
and a bit confused.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--PROMETHEUS DOCK, NIGHT
[The Prometheus is docked, presumably on Earth, but it is not clear.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Daniel enters and is walking through a corridor in civilian clothing.
He is smiling as he meets General Hammond.]
DANIEL
General!
HAMMOND
Welcome aboard.
DANIEL
(shaking hands with him)
Thank you, sir. Again.
HAMMOND
My motives were purely selfish, Doctor Jackson. We haven't heard a
word from the Atlantis expedition team since they first left. We
have no idea what we're going to find in the Pegasus. Your knowledge
and expertise will no doubt prove invaluable.
[He takes Daniel by the shoulder, and they begin walking.]
DANIEL
General, if--if you don't mind my asking...
HAMMOND
Why am I going?
DANIEL
Well, you could have chosen anyone to command this mission.
HAMMOND
You know, I sat back and watched you people go on a lot of
adventures over the years.
DANIEL
It's just I thought when you were replaced at the SGC, you were sort
of bucking for retirement.
HAMMOND
And then I led Prometheus against Anubis' fleet.
DANIEL
Got your dander up.
HAMMOND
That's why I took the job as head of Homeworld Security. And then
this opportunity came along. Well, the President put me in charge,
so I could choose anyone I wanted to lead the mission.
DANIEL
So why not choose yourself?
HAMMOND
Like I said, I sent a lot of people into action over the years, and
more than a few didn't come back. I'd like to see this one through
personally.
DANIEL
We've never left anyone behind, sir.
HAMMOND
And we're not going to this time.
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus is traveling through hyperspace.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is at the front of the room, briefing the crew, including
Hammond and Harriman. Daniel is now wearing a black tee-shirt and BDU
pants. The others are wearing blue Air Force flight suits.]
DANIEL
The last recorded malp telemetry from Atlantis indicated an enclosed
space with viable life support.
[Doctor Novak, a female civilian scientist, enters and hiccups. She
tells herself to stop it as she sits down.]
DANIEL
Now we're going on the assumption that the expedition team found the
Lost City and was able to set up a base of operations there.
[Novak hiccups again. Everyone looks at her.]
NOVAK
Sorry.
HAMMOND
Doctor Novak?
NOVAK
Uh, the Asgard hyperdrive is functioning at one hundred percent,
sir.
HAMMOND
Thank you. Doctor Jackson?
DANIEL
(distracted)
I'm sorry. What was I saying?
NOVAK
Uh, you were assuming the Lost City was at the other end of this
field trip.
[She hiccups again.]
NOVAK
Please ignore me.
DANIEL
It's hard to.
HAMMOND
(to Novak)
You disagree, Doctor?
NOVAK
Well, as far as we know, the Atlantis team found another outpost
like the one on Antarctica. Could be on a moon or at the bottom of
some deep, dark ocean.
[She hiccups again.]
HAMMOND
Which is why we're going. If they're trapped and need help--
NOVAK
If they're even alive at all.
[She hiccups again. Harriman quietly slides a glass of water toward
her.]
DANIEL
As for why they've been unable to make contact with Earth, hopefully
it's just a matter of being unable to locate a viable power source.
HAMMOND
Using information collected from the Ancient outpost on Earth,
Doctor Jackson and his team have pinpointed our destination in the
Pegasus galaxy.
DANIEL
(indicating a map on a flat-screen display)
Which is here.
[Novak hiccups again.]
NOVAK
(loudly)
Dammit to hell!
[While everyone watches, she takes the glass of water, turns her chair
away from the conference table, leans over and tries to drink from the
far side of the glass to get rid of the hiccups. There are loud
slurping sounds. Harriman is trying not to laugh. Daniel looks vaguely
disturbed.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Novak joins Daniel to wait for an elevator.]
DANIEL
(smiling)
Doctor Novak.
NOVAK
Doctor Jackson.
DANIEL
Daniel.
NOVAK
You can call me Lindsey. Um, sorry for contradicting you in the
briefing.
DANIEL
Oh, no, don't be, I mean, you were right.
[The enter the elevator and she reaches around him aggressively to push
the button for her floor. Daniel has to duck out of her way.]
DANIEL
The fact that we haven't heard from the Atlantis expedition since
they left is a bad sign.
[She hiccups again.]
DANIEL
Tried holding your breath?
NOVAK
God, I've tried everything.
DANIEL
Yeah, that doesn't work for me either.
NOVAK
It's been like this since I was a kid.
[They exit the elevator.]
NOVAK
It uh, it comes on when I get scared, but this is the worst it's
been since my Ph.D. presentation. I mean, I don't really do well in
stressful situations. I guess that's why I turned down going to
Atlantis the first time.
DANIEL
(looking at his watch)
Well, I'm sure you're gonna be fine. General Hammond says you're,
uh, very good at what you do, so...
NOVAK
(very pleased)
Oh, thank you.
[An alarm siren begins to sound in the corridor.]
NOVAK
What's that? What's wrong?
DANIEL
I don't know.
[Daniel leaves in a hurry. Novak tries to suppress her hiccups.]
NOVAK
(to herself)
Okay.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Reynolds, Hammond, and Harriman are in the command area. Daniel
enters.]
HAMMOND
(to Daniel)
We're picking up what sounds like a distress call.
DANIEL
Where are we?
HARRIMAN
We're still well inside the Milky Way.
HAMMOND
Play it back.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
VALA
(voice message breaking up)
Help. Require assistance...have failed...lost power to... Repeat,
stranded and--
DANIEL
She sounds human.
HAMMOND
What do you think?
DANIEL
Well, as much as I'd hate to delay this trip, I think we have to
check it out.
HAMMOND
(to Harriman)
How far away is it?
HARRIMAN
The message is originating just over fifty light years off our
designated route. We could be there in...twenty minutes.
HAMMOND
Set a course.
EXT--SPACE
[The Prometheus exits hyperspace to find two smaller ships adrift in
space in front of them.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
HAMMOND
(to Harriman)
Set shields at maximum. Arm weapons.
REYNOLDS
Looks like an Al'kesh and a cargo ship.
HARRIMAN
Scans indicate they've suffered significant damage. The distress
signal is originating from within the Al'kesh.
HAMMOND
I don't understand. A human distress call from a Goa'uld ship. That
makes no sense.
REYNOLDS
I agree sir. It could be a trap.
DANIEL
Look, I know this looks suspicious, but what if there was an
uprising on board one of those ships? There could be human prisoners
in need of our help.
HAMMOND
Open a channel.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
This is General George Hammond of the Earth vessel Prometheus. We're
answering your distress call and standing ready to assist you.
HARRIMAN
We can transport a portable sensor unit on board to determine life
support viability.
[Hammond nods.]
REYNOLDS
General, an Al'kesh is a potentially valuable ship. Even if there
are no survivors, we need to determine if it's spaceworthy. If it
is, we should salvage her.
HAMMOND
Take a team.
REYNOLDS
Yes, sir.
[Reynolds leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[View of the two ships, the Al'kesh in the foreground.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Reynolds and the rest of SG-3 arrive via the rings. They begin to
spread out and use the flashlights attached to their P-90's to peer
around the darkened ship.]
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
Prometheus, this is SG-3. We are on board.
[The move out into the corridors.]
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
General, we're seeing some energy weapon damage.
[He comes upon a dead Jaffa.]
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
We have one Jaffa, KIA.
SG-3 MEMBER
Sir, over here!
[They find more bodies.]
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
Make that four Jaffa. Looks like these folks had a little on-board
firefight. Still no sign of life. We're heading to the bridge.
[There is the sound of the rings activating.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
REYNOLDS
(via radio)
Prometheus, someone just activated the--
HAMMOND
Colonel Reynolds, say again!
HARRIMAN
Sir, our rings just activated.
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[A door opens, and there is a Super Soldier (Kull Warrior) entering the
main part of the ship.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
HAMMOND
Security team to Level Four ring room. Visuals onscreen.
[The screen shows nothing but static from the ring room.]
HAMMOND
Seal it off.
HARRIMAN
Controls are not responding, sir.
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[An airman is at the ring control panel.]
REYNOLDS
Airman?
SG-3 MEMBER
It's no good sir. The rings will not activate.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
HAMMOND
(into radio)
Security team, report!
HARRIMAN
All ship-board communications are down.
HAMMOND
Initiate emergency lock down.
HARRIMAN
I can't sir. It may be possible from the engine room.
HAMMOND
(to Daniel)
Go.
[Daniel leaves, followed by two others.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Daniel comes around a corner first and sees the Super Soldier. He
ducks into another corridor as the Soldier turns and zats the three men
following Daniel. Daniel peeks out from his hiding place, hearing
stomping boots and more zat firing. He runs across to another
corridor.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[The rings activate.]
SG-3 MEMBER
That wasn't me sir.
[They see that a pile of unconscious personnel have been sent over.]
REYNOLDS
Let's get them out of there.
[They begin to move them off of the ring platform.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[To the shock of Harriman and Hammond, the Super Soldier opens the door
to the bridge and enters, pointing a zat at them.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Daniel makes his way down the corridor to the armory. He enters and
takes a vest and one of the Super Soldier-killing guns.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Reynolds and the others are moving personnel to the edge of the room.
The rings activate again. Hammond, Harriman, and two others arrive,
conscious. They make their way to the bridge of the Al'kesh in time to
see Prometheus moving away.]
HAMMOND
Can we pursue?
REYNOLDS
Engines are off line. Controls are unresponsive. The weapons are off
line too, sir. It looks like we're dead in the water.
[Harriman enters.]
HARRIMAN
General, I just did a head count. Daniel Jackson is still aboard the
Prometheus.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel sneaks into the bridge, aiming the gun at the Soldier, who is
faced away from him. Daniel fires at the Soldier, but there is no
effect. It turns around to look at him, raising a zat. Daniel fires
again, and it aims the zat at him.]
DANIEL
Oh, crap.
[The Soldier fires the zat; Daniel yells in pain and falls,
unconscious.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[The crew is starting to wake up.]
HAMMOND
(to Novak)
Are you okay?
NOVAK
Oh, I feel like my head's going to explode. But on the bright side,
I think my hiccups are gone.
[She hiccups.]
NOVAK
What do you need, sir?
HAMMOND
I need this ship operational, now.
NOVAK
Yes, sir.
INT--AL'KESH BRIDGE
[Harriman is attempting to work the navigation system. Hammond
arrives.]
HARRIMAN
Near as I can tell, we're lucky that life support systems are still
working, sir.
HAMMOND
How much time do you figure we have?
HARRIMAN
That's hard to say. I've got some secondary systems online,
including some short range sensors, sir. Scans of the cargo ship
indicate that it's in worse shape than this Al'kesh. Strange, isn't
it, sir?
HAMMOND
That a Goa'uld super soldier would go to all this trouble to keep us
alive?
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel is sitting in one of the command chairs. His hands are tied to
the armrests by plastic tie-wraps, and he is unconscious. He wakes up
and notes his arms are tied down, then turns to look at the Super
Soldier, who is faced away from him, working on the ship controls.]
DANIEL
Hey, how's it goin'? Guess it's just you and me, huh? It's a little
strange isn't it? You see, that weapon I shot you with should have
killed you. What's even stranger is you guys usually don't take
prisoners, either. I mean, it's kinda kill first and...no, that's
generally just about it. Just the killing. I'm just gonna talk to
myelf here for a while, 'cause you're not gonna talk to me. Not that
you guys are very talkative, but uh...
[The Soldier finally turns around to face Daniel.]
SOLDIER
You may prove useful.
DANIEL
Okay, now we're gettin' somewhere. Where's everybody else?
SOLDIER
I transported them onto the Al'kesh.
DANIEL
Well, you kept the wrong guy, 'cause I don't know anything about the
ship.
SOLDIER
But you are very attractive.
DANIEL
(shocked, coughing)
What?
[The Soldier walks slowly and loudly toward Daniel, stepping up onto
the platform to stand just in front of him.]
DANIEL
Hey, you know, big guy. I'm flattered, really I am, it's just that,
uh, you're not my type. And I'm more than a little disturbed that I
might be yours.
[The Soldier begins to remove its helmet. Daniel turns his head and
closes his eyes in anticipated disgust.]
DANIEL
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't have to do that! Don't, don't, don't!
No.
[He opens his eyes. The Soldier is revealed to be a pretty woman with
long, dark hair that she flips as she removes the helmet.]
VALA
(smiling)
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.
DANIEL
Thank God.
VALA
Much. I hope.
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus is moving through normal space.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Vala is removing the Super Soldier armor pieces, leaving on the
one-piece cloth uniform.]
VALA
I wish to send a long-range transmission using the communications
systems.
DANIEL
Sorry, don't have a clue.
VALA
You lie.
DANIEL
(speaking quickly and nervously)
In general? No. Yes, well I try to be honest, but uh, occasionally a
little white one slips out every now and again--
[She slaps him across the face.]
DANIEL
Ah! Ow?
VALA
(in a sultry voice)
Shall I kiss it better?
DANIEL
Um, no. Just don't do it again. Hey look, even if I knew what it is
you wanted me to do, what makes you think I'd tell you? How the hell
do you think you can steal a ship when you don't know how it works?
VALA
I got the sublight engines going.
DANIEL
Yeah, so you did.
VALA
You really expect me to believe you don't know how your own ship
works?
DANIEL
Uh, okay, um, look. My name is Daniel Jackson. I'm an archaeologist,
a historian. I study ancient cultures, histories of the past,
ancient civilizations. Have you heard of Earth, Tau'ri?
[Vala moves to sit in the command chair next to Daniel.]
VALA
No.
DANIEL
Okay, well we were on our way to rescue a few friends who are
trapped--
VALA
Oh, I really don't care.
DANIEL
Look, this really isn't necessary--
VALA
(using her hands to indicate two people talking to each other)
Can I have the ship? No. Okay. Discussion over.
[She hits something with her fist and sees a message on the computer
screen: communications systems active.]
VALA
Oh. Here we go.
(into comm system)
Tenat of Oran. Tenat, this is Vala, if you can hear me, please
respond. I've managed to procure a vessel, bigger and better than
what I hoped for. Tenat, if you get this message, I apologize for
the delay and will meet at the designated coordinates in one day.
Vala out.
(to Daniel)
Now, about the hyperdrive...
[Daniel gives a tired sigh. Meanwhile, he has been working to cut
through the plastic tie around his right wrist, which she can't see
from where she's sitting.]
EXT--SPACE, NEAR THE TWO DISABLED SHIPS
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Novak is working on some crystals with Reynolds watching.]
HAMMOND
Colonel? Doctor?
NOVAK
I've re-routed remaining power to shields and life support for the
time being, but as far as the engines go...?
REYNOLDS
The control crystals for both sub-light and hyperdrive engines are
totally fried.
NOVAK
It looks like they were deliberately sabotaged.
HAMMOND
Can they be repaired?
NOVAK
In a word? No. We need new ones.
REYNOLDS
I was thinking about that cargo ship, sir.
HAMMOND
Sergeant Harriman says that life support over there is minimal.
Barely enough to sustain one person for a few moments.
NOVAK
And if we don't get new crystals?
(hiccupping)
Sorry, kill me now.
REYNOLDS
I'll go sir.
HAMMOND
No. I'll go.
REYNOLDS
Uh, with all due respect--
HAMMOND
Colonel! Someone took my ship. I want it back.
[He walks away.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Vala is still working at the console in front of her chair. The
console shows: access denied. Daniel is rubbing the right hand tie warp
on something sharp.]
VALA
Access is restricted by a code.
DANIEL
Yeah. Too bad.
[She suddenly fires an energy blast at him from the Super Soldier
weapon she's wearing on her left arm. The blast burns a wound into
Daniel's left upper arm, leaving the flesh and tee-shirt smoking.]
DANIEL
(in great pain)
Ah! Gaw!
VALA
(swiveling to face him)
That hurts?
DANIEL
Ah, yeah!
VALA
I can fix it.
[She holds up a small device on her right-hand fingers.]
DANIEL
(breathing hard)
I don't know the code!
[She moves seductively to sit on the console right in front of him. She
aims the device at his wound and activates it. The wound disappears and
the pain on Daniel's face fades. The hole in his tee-shirt remains but
the skin underneath is healed.]
VALA
There. Feel better?
DANIEL
You're a Goa'uld.
VALA
No. But I was once a host to one.
DANIEL
Which would explain the naquadah in your blood that lets you use
Goa'uld technology.
VALA
And how I can quickly learn to fly this rather primitive ship.
DANIEL
Yeah, so primitive, one would wonder if it was worth the bother.
VALA
Well, in this case it's the size that matters. Actually, pretty much
in every case.
[She is looking downward at his lower body. He looks amazed at her
brazenness.]
VALA
(pleading, touching the healed wound)
Tell me the code. Please.
DANIEL
I don't--I don't know it.
VALA
(resigned)
Fine.
[She moves away from Daniel, looks back at him, and leaves.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Hammond is getting ready to beam over to the cargo ship to retrieve
the needed crystals.]
REYNOLDS
How much time have will he have?
HARRIMAN
I'm guessing a few minutes. Maybe less.
REYNOLDS
Sir--
HAMMOND
Not another word, Colonel.
[Hammond enters the ring platform.]
HAMMOND
Do it now.
HARRIMAN
General. Godspeed.
INT--ABOARD THE CARGO SHIP
[The ring system activates. The lights in the cargo ship are dim red,
as Hammond makes his way down the corridor. He's already having trouble
breathing.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
NOVAK
(over comm system)
General? General, can you hear me?
HAMMOND
(over comm system, panting for breath)
I'm here in the engine room.
NOVAK
(over comm system)
Open the third panel down on the center column.
INT--ABOARD THE CARGO SHIP
[Hammond follows her instructions.]
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
Done.
NOVAK
(over comm system)
You want the blue one. It should be located at the center of the
panel.
[Hammond pulls out the blue crystal.]
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
Got it.
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
NOVAK
(over comm system)
One panel up, you should find a clear one.
INT--ABOARD THE CARGO SHIP
[Hammond opens the second panel.]
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
It's... hard to tell. The light in here is--
[Hammond coughs, and is obviously dizzy, but pulls out the crystal.]
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
Something's--
[Hammond slumps to the floor.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
NOVAK
(over comm system)
General, can you hear me?
REYNOLDS
It's only been two minutes.
NOVAK
There was a firefight onboard. If the life support is not cycling
the air--
REYNOLDS
What?
NOVAK
Staff blasts give off carbon dioxide. In a small, enclosed space--
[Reynolds, Novak and Harriman head to the ring transport.]
INT--ABOARD THE CARGO SHIP
[Hammond stumbles into the ring transport room. He collapses on the
floor, tossing the crystals into the ring, then passes out. The rings
activate, transporting the crystals back to the Al'kesh, while Reynolds
arrives on the cargo ship to pull Hammond into the rings for
transport.]
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Harriman retrieves the crystals and gives them to Novak, while another
crewman activates the rings. Hammond is still unconscious. Reynolds is
bent over him, checking him.]
REYNOLDS
General? General? Sir!
[Reynolds puts his head on Hammond's chest.]
HARRIMAN
Is he breathing?
[Reynolds shakes his head.]
NOVAK
He may need mouth-to-mouth.
[Reynolds appears reluctant but Novak gives him a 'come on already'
look. He positions Hammond's head for resuscitation. Just as he's about
to start, Hammond wakes up.]
REYNOLDS
Oh, excellent! Excellent waking up, sir. Good job on the crystals,
too.
HAMMOND
(grabbing Reynolds by the collar and pulling him in close)
Get the ship moving.
NOVAK
What did he say?
REYNOLDS
He said, 'get the ship moving'.
[Novak hiccups, then she and Harriman leave.]
REYNOLDS
(helping Hammond to sit up)
Come on, General. Let's get you up.
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus is moving through normal space.]
INT--ABOARD PROMETHEUS
[Vala is working with the crystal controls. She pulls out a single
uncolored crystal.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Vala is at the hyperdrive control panel. The screen indicates that the
hyperdrive course is plotting.]
VALA
Much better.
[Daniel appears, aiming a zat at her.]
DANIEL
Lose the weapon; move away from the console.
VALA
I liked you better tied up.
DANIEL
Against the wall. Lose the weapon.
[She removes the Soldier weapon from her left arm, along with the glove
underneath.]
VALA
This suit still absorbs zat blasts.
DANIEL
Then cover your head.
VALA
So, you should probably let me take it off.
DANIEL
I think I'll turn the ship around, first.
VALA
I don't know. If I had me at gunpoint, that wouldn't be my first
choice.
DANIEL
Yeah, well...
[He moves over to a console and enters the security code. It is
rejected.]
DANIEL
What's going on?
VALA
I rewrote the access codes, so I'm the only one who can use the
navigation systems.
DANIEL
Undo it.
VALA
Listen, hundreds of lives are at stake. I'm trying to save the last
of my people, and this ship is their only hope.
DANIEL
Maybe if you'd mentioned that off the top.
VALA
Would you really have helped?
DANIEL
Look, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, we were
also on a rescue mission.
[There is a beeping sound coming from the console.]
VALA
What is it?
DANIEL
(looking at radar console)
A ship just appeared on our radar. It's an Al'kesh.
VALA
This quadrant is crawling with Goa'uld vessels. Chances are it's not
your friends. I made sure that ship was fully disabled when you
showed up.
DANIEL
(typing into computer)
We'll see.
VALA
We have to raise shields and arm weapons.
DANIEL
I'll try and hail them first.
[He starts to walk away, and she kicks out, knocking the zat out of his
hand then back-handing him across the face. She swings again; he stops
her and elbows her in the nose.]
VALA
Oh, oh, oh. You hit me.
DANIEL
You hit me.
VALA
Yeah, you know we could just have sex instead.
[She hits him then kicks him, sending him part way across the room to
land on his back. She runs over and grabs him by the ear, pulling him
up. He grabs her hair and pushes her to the wall. There is lots of
grunting. He goes to hit her but hits a glass panel instead when she
moves. She drops down and grabs a fire extinguisher and hits him in the
groin with it. He doubles over in great pain. She pushes him back to
the console and slugs him so that he falls over it backward, grunting
and disappearing behind it.]
INT--ABOARD AL'KESH
[Hammond enters to find Reynolds and Novak.]
REYNOLDS
Feeling better, sir?
HAMMOND
Yes. Thank you.
REYNOLDS
We just caught up to the Prometheus.
HAMMOND
Nice work.
REYNOLDS
It was all Novak, sir.
[Novak hiccups.]
HARRIMAN
They're not responding to our hail, sir.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel crawls around from behind the console on his hands and knees,
sees her, and starts to crawl away. She jumps on top of him, trying to
squeeze his head with her thighs. He stands up with her on his
shoulders. She grabs a beam overhead, then he pushes her off him and
steps away. Hanging by her arms, she kicks him, and he falls to the
ground. She jumps on top of him, noticing the red mark on his cheek.]
VALA
Are we done?
DANIEL
I am.
[She pulls him up by the shirt and kisses him hard several times. He
stops her.]
DANIEL
You're a fruitcake!
[She head-butts him hard, and he falls back, dazed. She goes back to
the navigation controls. From off-screen, Daniel zats her. He sits,
looking very tired.]
INT--ABOARD AL'KESH
[Prometheus is visible through the viewscreen.]
HAMMOND
Weapons?
HARRIMAN
On line. We are in range.
HAMMOND
Target the rear thrusters. Take out her sub-light capability.
[Prometheus jumps to hyperspace and disappears.]
REYNOLDS
She just jumped into hyperspace.
[Hammond nods, angry.]
EXT--SPACE
[Prometheus is traveling through hyperspace.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIG
[Vala is lying on her back on the floor of the brig. She's now wearing
a blue flight suit and black boots. She wakes up with a headache and
takes in her surroundings and clothing.]
VALA
Ow. Oh, that's just great.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel is looking out the front viewscreen at the hyperspace view. Via
an audio feed, he hears Vala moving around and grunting. Reluctantly he
brings up the live video feed of her on his computer screen.]
DANIEL
I see you.
[She walks over to the video camera. He waves at her image.]
VALA
Did you have fun taking off my clothes?
DANIEL
It was your idea.
VALA
No, I meant when I was conscious, you know, so I could distract you
and kick you in the head.
DANIEL
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.
VALA
I'm sure you did.
[He moves his fingers over her moving image, pretending to squeeze her
head.]
DANIEL
So, where're we goin'?
VALA
I told you, to save my people. Can you please let me out of here?
DANIEL
Oh...no.
VALA
(sitting down, using the toilet as a chair)
You know, I haven't eaten in days.
DANIEL
(rolling his eyes)
Could you please tell me how to access the navigation controls?
VALA
It isn't very nice, you know, starving a prisoner to death. Come on,
you've seen me naked. The least you could do is cook me dinner.
[Daniel rolls his eyes.]
INT--PROMETHEUS MESS HALL
[They are seated at opposite ends of a long dining table. Vala is
eating a whole array of fruits and other food. Daniel is sitting stock
still and holding a zat aimed at her, ready to fire.]
VALA
(rolling an apple toward him)
Aren't you hungry?
DANIEL
No.
VALA
Thank you. You know the Tok'ra?
DANIEL
Yep.
VALA
Ten years ago, a Tok'ra incited a rebellion on my planet. When
people rose up against the ruling Goa'uld and, once the Jaffa had
been overcome, the Goa'uld was captured alive, tortured and beaten
for days on end. I was host to that Goa'uld at the time. The people
didn't understand that it was the symbiote that had ruled over them
so harshly. I guess the Tok'ra felt responsible. He rescued me,
removed the Goa'uld symbiote, nursed me back to health.
DANIEL
You said your people are in trouble now.
VALA
Well, it was only a matter of time before the forces of another
Goa'uld showed up. A system lord named Camulus. That's when the
Tok'ra disappeared. The people still refused to surrender. Camulus
ordered that they be wiped out. We controlled several ships: troop
transports, cargo ships, Al'kesh. Many people were saved, flown to
an inhabitable nearby moon in the system. The ships made several
trips before most of them were intercepted and shot down. Camulus
never knew there were any survivors, so we were safe. Only problem
was, the moon didn't have a Stargate.
DANIEL
So you were trapped.
VALA
We only had a few ships left. Not enough to relocate everyone again.
It wasn't a problem. Camulus seemed to have little interest. On the
other planets in the system he'd left behind a small force to guard
the Stargate. We used the ships to keep appraised of what was
happening and to steal supplies and technology when we could.
DANIEL
You know that Camulus is gone now. He was beaten by Ba'al.
VALA
And Ba'al's forces are searching every inhabitable world in Camulus'
territory. His ships are everywhere. It's only a matter of time
before my people are found.
DANIEL
So you got desperate and tried to steal that Al'kesh.
VALA
It was damaged in the firefight. I was hoping one of my ships would
answer my distress call. I'm sure you can imagine how lucky I felt
when this ship showed up. It's big enough to rescue all my people
and take them to a world far away...free from the Goa'uld.
[Daniel appears unsure whether to believe her.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIG
[Daniel opens the door to the cell and ushers Vala inside.]
VALA
You don't have to lock me up.
DANIEL
Oh, I think I do.
VALA
What difference is it going to make? The ship is automatically
flying to my homeworld. You can't stop it.
DANIEL
Well when I get to your planet, I'll just explain the situation to
your people. Maybe there's something we can work out.
VALA
My people are not going to trust you. You have to let me talk to
them.
DANIEL
No.
[He starts to close the door on her.]
VALA
Daniel.
[He closes the door and moves away.]
VALA
This is bad.
EXT--SPACE, NEAR A PLANET AND A MOON
[Prometheus arrives at the system and heads toward the inhabitable
moon.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel walks in and sits in the command chair. Immediately he hears a
voice over the comm system.]
TENAT
Vala, this is Tenat. We have you on our scanners.
DANIEL
(activating comm)
Uh, yeah. Hi.
TENAT
Where is Vala?
DANIEL
She's here. She's just indisposed at the moment.
TENAT
She did not mention she was working with someone.
DANIEL
No, I guess not. Look, I realize I owe you an explanation, and it's
a bit of a long story, really.
TENAT
We will hear it in person and inspect your vessel.
DANIEL
That's good. Because apparently we're coming in for a landing.
TENAT
We will meet you at the designated coordinates.
DANIEL
Okie dokie, see you there.
EXT--SURFACE OF A MOON, DAY
[The Prometheus descends and lands in front of two non-human aliens.
They pick up a metal chest between them and move toward the ship.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIG
[Vala is working with an electrical panel, trying to open the cell
door. She gets shocked by a spark. In desperation she approaches the
video camera and starts talking to it.]
VALA
Ow! Ah... Okay. You want the truth? I'll tell you the truth...
Daniel, are you there?
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[The command chair is empty. Vala is shown on the console monitor.]
VALA
I hope you can hear me. The planet we just landed on is not my
homeworld. Whatever you do, you must not go out there.
[The other video monitor shows Daniel approaching the aliens.]
EXT--SURFACE OF A MOON, DAY
[Daniel approaches the aliens wearing the Super Soldier fabric suit and
the armor and weapons pieces. His head is uncovered. The aliens are
decidedly not human, with slitted eyes and appendages extending from
the backs of their heads.]
DANIEL
Hi guys!
TENAT
Who are you?
DANIEL
Uh, name's Olo, Hans Olo.
TENAT
Where is Vala?
DANIEL
She's inside.
TENAT
We will only do business with Vala!
DANIEL
Business. Yeah, that figures. Not that I'm surprised or anything. I
don't look surprised to you do I?
TENAT
(confused)
What?
DANIEL
It's just I was expecting some refugees in need of transport to
another planet. Human sort of refugees. Not that there's anything
wrong with you guys, that I know of.
ALIEN
We have the naquadah.
[Tenat opens the chest revealing many bars of metal.]
TENAT
Refined weapons grade.
DANIEL
(sincerely)
Ooh, that's nice.
TENAT
This was the price we agreed upon. This ship is impressive in size,
but we cannot--
DANIEL
Okay, you know what? Uh, seriously, there's been a big
misunderstanding. I don't care what you've got, I'm not gonna sell
you the ship, so--
[The aliens draw weapons, and Daniel draws his zat.]
DANIEL
Okay, you know what, that is not necessary.
TENAT
(angry)
We had a deal. We must have this ship!
[They suddenly come under fire from death gliders swooping in and
firing on Prometheus.]
TENAT
Goa'uld gliders! Fool, you were followed!
DANIEL
Of course we were. Okay, you know what? I'd love to stay and chat
but--
[He zats the alien, then Tenat fires at him, hitting him. The shot has
no effect due to the Super Soldier suit. Daniel zats Tenat then turns
and runs back into Prometheus.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Daniel runs through the corridor, taking off the Super Soldier armor
as he runs. The ship is under attack and there are impacts and sparks
flying.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel arrives and takes a seat. Vala is visible on the video screen.]
VALA
Daniel? What's going on?
DANIEL
We're being attacked by gliders! Tell me how to access the ship's
systems.
VALA
Let me out, and I'll help you.
DANIEL
You gotta be kidding me!
[There is a small explosion nearby, and Daniel looks desperate.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIG
[Daniel arrives and opens the door. Vala is standing there with a big
fake smile. Daniel keeps his zat aimed at her.]
DANIEL
Let's go. No funny stuff.
[The enter the corridor and head toward the bridge.]
VALA
What did you do with my buyers?
DANIEL
We'll talk about that later.
VALA
And the naquadah?
[She stops in the hallway.]
DANIEL
Move!
VALA
Do you have any idea what that is worth?
[Frustrated, Daniel picks her up and bends her over his shoulder,
against her protests. He runs with her toward the bridge. He sets her
down just outside the bridge, and they enter and sit in separate
chairs.]
VALA
All right, raise our shields.
[Daniel does so.]
EXT--SURFACE OF MOON, DAY
[Prometheus lifts off the surface, still under heavy fire from the
darting death gliders. The shields are taking the impacts.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
DANIEL
What are you waiting for? Let's go to hyperspace!
VALA
I can't; it's not working. We've already taken too much hull damage.
But we have incoming Al'kesh. Arm weapons.
EXT--SPACE, ABOVE SURFACE OF MOON
[Prometheus is coming off of the planet under heavy fire from many
gliders and Al'kesh.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
VALA
Shields are failing.
[Daniel's console shows the weapons system is targeting.]
EXT--SPACE
[The ship's weapons system takes out a glider.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[There is intensive sparks, smoke, and damage appearing on the bridge.]
VALA
And shields are down. We're almost out of weapons.
EXT--SPACE
[A ship fires on another, destroying it.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Daniel watches the ship blow up on the viewscreen.]
VALA
What just happened?
DANIEL
An Al'kesh just took out one of its own.
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Hammond, Reynolds, and Novak are on the bridge.]
HAMMOND
Nice work, Sergeant. Target the second Al'kesh. Fire at will.
HARRIMAN
Roger that, sir.
EXT--SPACE
[Hammond's Al'kesh takes out the other one. The other gliders wave
off.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
HAMMOND
(over comm system)
Doctor Jackson? This is General Hammond. Do you copy?
[Daniel moves to the command chair.]
DANIEL
(into comm system)
Uh General, it's me. Good to hear your voice, sir.
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
[Reynolds and Novak smile in relief.]
HAMMOND
Likewise. You all right, son?
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
DANIEL
(looking at Vala)
We're fine Sir.
INT--ABOARD THE AL'KESH
HAMMOND
Are we clear to ring aboard?
DANIEL
(into comm system)
Stand by.
(to Vala)
Unlock the system. Those gliders likely retreated to a nearby
mothership. We have to get out of here now. Unlock the system.
[Vala nods and does so.]
DANIEL
(into comm system)
You're all clear, sir.
VALA
What are you gonna do with me?
DANIEL
I'm not sure.
VALA
Look, Daniel, whatever happens, I just want you to know--
[Daniel zats her to shut her up, then rolls his eyes and shakes his
head.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Al'kesh and Prometheus are flying in formation.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Hammond, Daniel, and Novak are walking. Daniel is wearing an undamaged
tee-shirt.]
NOVAK
We managed to get the shields and hyperdrive back on line, but there
was significant hull damage. I wouldn't recommend a long journey in
hyperspace.
HAMMOND
I'm afraid but we have no choice but to return to Earth.
DANIEL
How long before the ship's ready to go again?
NOVAK
Hard to say.
HAMMOND
It's good work, Doctor, both here and on the Al'kesh.
NOVAK
Thank you, sir.
[Novak starts to walk away.]
DANIEL
Hey? Hiccups are gone, huh?
NOVAK
I didn't even notice. I guess I was having too much fun.
[The ship alarm begins to sound.]
HARRIMAN
(over comm system)
Security to Level Four, the prisoner has escaped.
DANIEL
Ring room!
[He and Hammond run away.]
NOVAK
(noting that she doesn't have hiccups)
Wow!
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Hammond arrives and sits in his command chair, next to Harriman.]
HAMMOND
Status?
HARRIMAN
Security Team One unresponsive. And the rings on level four just
activated, sir.
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Daniel walks down the corridor, holding his zat, stepping over the
bodies of unconscious crewmen. He comes to the ring room and finds
SG-3, all unconscious on the platform. He takes a radio from one of
them.]
DANIEL
(into radio)
General Hammond? SG-3 was just transported here. She's on the
Al'kesh.
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Hammond sees the Al'kesh fly away on the viewscreen.]
HAMMOND
Lock weapons on its engines.
HARRIMAN
Aft thrusters targeted.
[Daniel arrives on the bridge, breathless from running.]
HARRIMAN
Target is...
[The viewscreen shows the Al'kesh entering hyperspace.]
HARRIMAN
Ah, it's gone, sir.
HAMMOND
Can we track it?
HARRIMAN
No, sir. Our long-range scanners are being scrambled.
DANIEL
She's good.
FADE OUT
