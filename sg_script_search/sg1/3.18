TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[Tollan people are going about their daily business.]
INT--COURTHOUSE, TOLLANA
[SG-1 are sitting before Chancellor Travell.]
DANIEL
(to Travell)
Your Eminence, our government has asked us to return to Tollana to
arrange for formal diplomatic relations with your people.
Chancellor TRAVELL
Consider it done. You are after all the people who saved us from the
Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Thank you. Yes. Well, in that spirit we'd like to arrange for a
trade.
TRAVELL
What would you like to trade?
DANIEL
Technology.
TRAVELL
I'm sorry. You know that is the one thing we cannot give you. Tollan
law strictly forbids it.
DANIEL
Ok, we understand that. However, in our culture, laws can be changed
when it's deemed that the reasons for those laws are no longer
relevant.
TRAVELL
The reasons for these laws are still relevant.
DANIEL
Ok, please, if you just allow me to make our case.
TRAVELL
I assume you want weapons technology.
DANIEL
Yes.
O'NEILL
One of those ion cannons would be nice.
TRAVELL
I see. And for what will you use such a cannon?
O'NEILL
To defend ourselves against the Goa'uld.
TRAVELL
Forgive me, Colonel, but our research shows that you are far more
likely to use our technology against enemies on your own planet.
O'NEILL
What if I gave you my word that would never happen?
TRAVELL
Are you the commander of your entire nation?
[O'Neill thinks about it.]
O'NEILL
No.
TRAVELL
Then in truth, you cannot guarantee it.
O'NEILL
You know what? Forget it.
DANIEL
Jack?
[O'Neill gets to his feet.]
O'NEILL
We knew you wouldn't give us anything. We're wasting a lot of time
here.
DANIEL
Jack...
O'NEILL
No, Daniel. Let's go.
[O'Neill walks out of the courthouse, followed by the rest of SG-1.]
INT--CORRIDOR, TOLLANA
[SG-1 are heading down a corridor.]
DANIEL
(to O'Neill)
What are you doing?
O'NEILL
(angrily)
We never should have saved their technologically superior butts.
(He stops before a lighted panel.)
It's that thing they disable our weapons with, isn't it?
TEAL'C
As well as the Goa'uld technology.
DANIEL
Don't even think about it.
[O'Neill ignores him and pulls the panel off the wall.]
CARTER
Sir, isn't this against regulations?
[O'Neill pulls a device out of the wall and takes it.]
O'NEILL
I suppose it is, Carter. Let's go.
[He starts heading down the corridor, followed by his team.]
DANIEL
Kind of crossing the line...
O'NEILL
Shut up Daniel.
END OF TEASER
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM, SGC
[Carter is sitting in the conference room, holding the device O'Neill
took from Tollana. She exchanges an uneasy glance with Daniel. Hammond
comes out of his office and takes a seat at the head of the table.]
HAMMOND
As you were. Sorry to keep you waiting. So, what is this device
you've brought back?
O'NEILL
It's the thing the Tollan used to disable our weapons the last time
we were there.
HAMMOND
And it really works?
O'NEILL
Worked on us. And the Goa'uld.
HAMMOND
It should come in handy. Good job.
O'NEILL
Thank you, sir.
[He glances at Carter, who looks down.]
HAMMOND
So, what did you have to promise them in return, Dr Jackson?
DANIEL
Actually General, we didn't...er...have to promise to give them
anything.
HAMMOND
They just gave you the device as a reward for saving them from the
Goa'uld?
[There is a long silence, before Daniel speaks.]
DANIEL
Actually, General, the Tollan refused to give us any technology.
O'NEILL
Offered us a nice fruit basket, though.
HAMMOND
I'm confused. How did you get the device? Major Carter?
[She looks up, appearing extremely uncomfortable.]
CARTER
Uh...
O'NEILL
(interrupting)
I took it, sir.
HAMMOND
Took it?
O'NEILL
Yes.
HAMMOND
You stole it?
O'NEILL
I like to think of it as borrowed, sir. Major Carter can figure out
how to reproduce it and we'll give it back.
HAMMOND
I can't believe what I'm hearing. You and your team stole an alien
device from an extremely advanced alien culture.
O'NEILL
They won't retaliate, if that's what you're worried about. Not their
way, right Daniel?
HAMMOND
This command has already been accused of stealing from several other
alien cultures, Colonel. Until now, we've denied it. Perhaps that
was a bit premature. Dare I ask how many other items you've stolen?
O'NEILL
None. This is the first.
HAMMOND
Colonel, you don't seem to understand how serious this matter is.
You and your team have committed a court-martiable offence.
O'NEILL
To be fair, General, I did it. Carter and Daniel protested. And
Teal'c...well he really didn't say anything but I could tell he was
opposed to my actions by the way he cocked his head and sort of
raised his eyebrow...
HAMMOND
Enough, Colonel. Dr Jackson, Major Carter and Teal'c. You will
return this device immediately to the Tollan and hopefully smooth
over what must be some very ruffled feathers.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
Why? Our core mission is to go through that Gate and find
technologies we can use to defend against Goa'uld incursion. Am I
right?
HAMMOND
You are bordering on insubordination. We do not steal from
friendlies.
O'NEILL
Well, with no due respect, General, that's just plain stupid.
HAMMOND
Colonel...
O'NEILL
And since the Pentagon won't approve our backup program, we have no
choice!
HAMMOND
Colonel, do not go there...
O'NEILL
(shouting)
We have no choice but to take whatever steps we need to get what we
need!
HAMMOND
As long as I am in command of the SGC, we will hold ourselves to the
highest ethical standards.
O'NEILL
(angry)
And when the Goa'uld wipe us out because we have nothing with which
to defend ourselves, I'm sure we'll all feel great about ourselves
and our high, moral standards!
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill. You are out of line. Now stand down!
[O'Neill sits back, looking angry.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, I am hereby relieving you of your command. You are
to report to the Infirmary and stay there until I send for you.
O'NEILL
(snidely)
No holding cell, sir?
HAMMOND
That could very well be your next stop if you say another word.
VOICE
(over intercom)
Incoming traveller.
[In the Gate room, the Stargate is dialling up.]
HAMMOND
(cont'd)
Now get down the Infirmary and submit yourself for a complete
examination. Teal'c, escort him.
[O'Neill rises and glares at Hammond, before turning away. Teal'c moves
to follow him.]
HAMMOND
And Teal'c? You are no longer under Colonel O'Neill's command, is
that understood?
TEAL'C
Understood.
[In the Gate room, the Stargate opens.]
VOICE
(over intercom)
Unauthorised incoming traveller. Closing the iris.
HAMMOND
Great. Now what?
[He heads down to the Control room with Carter and Daniel.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[Armed soldiers take position inside the Gate room as the iris is
closed. The iris starts to flex and Chancellor Travell and a Tollan
woman appear through it.]
HAMMOND
Hold your fire!
[They quickly go into the Gate room as Travell walks down the ramp.]
DANIEL
Your Eminence, welcome to Earth. High Chancellor Travell, this is
General Hammond, Commander of this facility.
HAMMOND
It's an honour to meet you.
TRAVELL
I only wish it were under more pleasant circumstances. We have come
to retrieve our stolen property and to tell you that all diplomatic
relations with your people will be terminated.
HAMMOND
Of course we will return your property to you immediately. But
please, if you will just sit down with us and at least talk about
it.
TRAVELL
Then you admit that you have stolen from us.
DANIEL
Your Eminence, I know that you're wise enough not to hold the
actions of...one man against an entire planet.
TRAVELL
You were there, Dr Jackson, as were you Major, and Teal'c. Who
exactly are you saying is responsible?
INT--INFIRMARY, SGC
[FRASIER is reading through a report, while O'Neill sits on a bed,
buttoning his shirt.]
FRASIER
There doesn't appear to be anything immediately wrong with you. Your
blood pressure, DRE and EEG all seem normal. It'll be a while before
I get your hormone levels and CAT scans back.
O'NEILL
Great. Let me know what kind of wacky alien stuff you find in there.
[He hops down from the bed and goes to the door, where Teal'c is
standing guard.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Excuse me.
TEAL'C
I am to keep you here until General Hammond is ready for you.
O'NEILL
Get out of my way Teal'c. That's an order.
TEAL'C
I do not understand your behaviour O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(angrily)
Get out of my way!
[The phone rings and FRASIER answers it.]
FRASIER
Frasier. Yes, sir.
(She hangs up.)
Colonel? General Hammond wants to see you in his office.
[Teal'c stands aside and O'Neill brushes passed him.]
INT--CORRIDOR, SGC
[Carter comes out of the Control Room as O'Neill and Teal'c walk
passed.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
CARTER
sir?
[O'Neill stops and turns around.]
O'NEILL
What?
CARTER
Is there anything I can do?
O'NEILL
About?
CARTER
Well, sir, with respect you aren't exactly acting like yourself.
O'NEILL
No Carter. I haven't been acting like myself since I met you. Now
I'm acting like myself.
[Carter looks hurt as O'Neill walks away.]
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM, SGC
[O'Neill heads up the stairs in time to see Travell leaving with
Daniel.]
O'NEILL
(to Travell)
Well, look who's here. Come to retrieve your vastly superior stuff.
You know, it would be a lot more superior if it wasn't so easy to
steal.
HAMMOND
(from his office)
Colonel O'Neill! Get in here and take a seat! Close the door.
[Teal'c closes the door as O'Neill sits before Hammond.]
HAMMOND
By God Jack, you've really crossed the line here.
O'NEILL
In terms of my insubordination toward you, you're absolutely right
General. And for that, I'm truly sorry. I still think what I did was
right.
HAMMOND
I just met with two members of the Tollan High Council who disagree.
O'NEILL
So the Tollan are dictating our policies now, eh?
HAMMOND
The victims of a crime are demanding that the perpetrator be dealt
with appropriately.
O'NEILL
I'm a criminal?
HAMMOND
What you've done here is clearly a court-martiable offence. I have
to press charges.
O'NEILL
Well, by all means, General, do what you have to do.
HAMMOND
I do have one other option I can offer you, Jack.
O'NEILL
What's that?
HAMMOND
Early retirement.
O'NEILL
See, I tried that once and you pulled me out of it.
HAMMOND
The offer is only on the table while you're in this room.
O'NEILL
All this for one little indiscretion.
[Hammond whips open a file and starts to read.]
HAMMOND
Five counts of direct insubordination to superior officers and a
United States Senator. Two counts of refusal to obey orders.
Kidnapping an alien child. Shall I go on?
O'NEILL
The proverbial straw, sir?
HAMMOND
You got it. I'd accept the offer if I were you Jack. Beats the hell
outta the prison time you'd get otherwise.
O'NEILL
Then I guess I'm retired.
INT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE (DAY)
[O'Neill is sitting on his couch, playing with a chess set. The
doorbell rings and he gets up to answer the door. It's Daniel.]
DANIEL
Hi.
O'NEILL
What do you want?
DANIEL
I'm not, ah...I'm not sure to tell you the truth. I'm here to talk,
I guess.
O'NEILL
So talk.
[He takes a swig on his beer bottle.]
DANIEL
You got another one of those?
O'NEILL
Yes.
DANIEL
Feel like sharing?
O'NEILL
Beer? Sure.
[He walks off and Daniel enters the house. He goes into the sitting
room while O'Neill fetches him a beer.]
DANIEL
So...how are you feeling about all of this?
O'NEILL
Yes to the beer. No to the feelings.
DANIEL
That's, ah, that's too bad because I don't really like beer.
[They sit down.]
O'NEILL
Stop your worrying. I'm fine.
DANIEL
Really. That's, ah, that's funny because I didn't figure you for the
early retirement type anymore. There's another reason you're angry,
isn't there?
O'NEILL
Oh here we go. Pop psyche 101, right?
DANIEL
No. When we were in the briefing, you said something about the
Pentagon not giving us the backup we requested. What, er, what were
you talking about?
O'NEILL
Hammond and I were planning a secondary SGC base offworld. It was
going to serve as a backup in case ours was attacked. I was going to
command.
DANIEL
And the Pentagon pulled the plug. So you're acting out because
you're hurt, because you didn't get a command.
O'NEILL
Gimme a break Daniel. Their denial of the program was just another
indication that they're not serious about attaining our goals.
DANIEL
Which you think is attaining new weapons and technology.
O'NEILL
Protecting ourselves.
DANIEL
But isn't our mission also about establishing and maintaining
diplomatic relations with other cultures?
O'NEILL
What's the point if we don't gain anything to help our other
interests?
DANIEL
Well there's a lot we could learn from people like the Tollan that
has nothing to do with technology and weapons.
O'NEILL
Stuff that interests people like you, Daniel. Not people like me. I
want to see tangible gains from our efforts, and if people like the
Tollan don't want to share, we should just take.
DANIEL
You really believe that?
O'NEILL
Being sweet and nice isn't going to stop three or four Goa'uld
motherships if they decide to come back again. I'd rather be a thief
and alive than honest and dead. It's a cliché, but there it is.
DANIEL
If you really believe that, I guess, ah, I guess I never really knew
you at all.
O'NEILL
Come on. You're a bright guy. You had to sense some of this.
[Daniel doesn't answer.]
O'NEILL
(cont'd)
Then no. I guess you couldn't relate to me any more than I could to
you.
DANIEL
So this whole, ah, this whole friendship thing we've been working on
in the last few years is...
O'NEILL
Apparently not much of a foundation there, huh?
[He drinks his beer. Daniel gets up and leaves.]
INT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE (DAY)
[O'Neill is playing once more with his chess set. The doorbell rings
and he opens the door to find Colonel Mayborne and two other airmen.]
MAYBORNE
Colonel O'Neill.
O'NEILL
What the hell is this, a joke, Mayborne? What are you doing here?
MAYBORNE
Well, in a way, you invited me.
O'NEILL
Come to gloat about my retirement, have you?
MAYBORNE
May I come in?
O'NEILL
No. I am in no way obligated to put up with your crap any more.
MAYBORNE
I think you're going to want to hear what I have to offer you.
O'NEILL
Offer?
[Mayborne nods and O'Neill lets him in.]
MAYBORNE
May I sit down?
O'NEILL
No. You won't be here that long. What's this about?
MAYBORNE
Well, suffice it to say, I've heard about your little altercations
with General Hammond.
O'NEILL
Sweet little grapevine we got there isn't it?
MAYBORNE
Let's just say that I see a lot of paper that goes through the
mountain. I was most interested in your passionate argument that we
shouldn't be quite so diplomatic about acquiring the things we need.
O'NEILL
Get to the point.
MAYBORNE
What if I told you I could offer you a way to achieve your goals?
O'NEILL
My goals?
MAYBORNE
Yes. What if I told you I could arrange for you to lead a team
through the Gate to acquire whatever you want, whenever you want.
For the good of this country.
O'NEILL
If I believed you could do that, I'd have to figure whatever you're
doing is very illegal.
MAYBORNE
What you did yesterday was very illegal, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Get out. Not interested.
[Mayborne leaves his card.]
MAYBORNE
Page me when you miss the actions too much.
[O'Neill closes the door when he leaves.]
INT--SGC
[The remaining members of SG-1 are waiting for Hammond.]
TEAL'C
For what purpose were we summoned?
DANIEL
My guess is we're getting our fourth.
CARTER
Who do you think it'll be?
DANIEL
Well, we'll probably get someone like Ferreti and you'll get
command.
CARTER
Oh, I don't know about that. They'll probably go with someone higher
than Major.
[Hammond comes down the stairs followed by Colonel Makepeace.]
HAMMOND
As you were. Since SG-1 is considered the flagship unit, it falls on
me to assure that you have the strongest possible leadership.
Therefore I'm reassigning the most senior officer we have in the
field as your new commanding officer. Colonel Makepeace will be
joining SG-1 immediately. I hope you'll make him feel welcome.
DANIEL
Sir, uh, I don't want to seem out of line here, but, uh, since I'm a
civilian here and the only one who can say this...
HAMMOND
Spit it out Doctor.
DANIEL
Well, no offence, but doesn't Major Carter deserve to take charge of
SG-1?
HAMMOND
Major Carter has an exemplary record on the team as recognised by
her recent promotion to Major. But Major is a far cry from Colonel.
CARTER
I understand General.
DANIEL
I'm sorry, I don't. What difference does it make what title she has?
The point is that the...
CARTER
It's alright Daniel. Really.
HAMMOND
Dismissed.
[Hammond leaves.]
MAKEPEACE
I'm proud to join you folks. I hope you can learn to trust my
command as much as you did Colonel O'Neill's.
CARTER
I'm sure we will, sir.
DANIEL
I never really trusted Jack's command, but, uh, I'm open.
MAKEPEACE
That's good. Then I'll see you at our first briefing.
[Teal'c turns around and walks out on them.]
INT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[O'Neill looks out through his blinds to see a car parked down the
road, watching his house. He looks down to see Mayborne's card on the
desk below and picks it up, thinking.]
EXT--O'Neill's HOUSE (DAY)
[O'Neill is sitting out on his veranda, reading a magazine and
listening to classical music. Mayborne comes around the corner.]
O'NEILL
What took you so long?
MAYBORNE
Frankly I didn't think you'd get bored quite so fast or I would have
stayed in town.
O'NEILL
Not quite the student of human behaviour you thought you were?
MAYBORNE
Are you ready to go?
O'NEILL
I have some questions.
MAYBORNE
I can't tell you much.
O'NEILL
You expect me to jump into this...operation blind?
MAYBORNE
Are you interested in my offer or not?
[O'Neill thinks about it.]
O'NEILL
I'm interested.
MAYBORNE
Good. I want to be sure understand one thing O'Neill. What I'm about
to show you is not so much classified as it is secret. Dangerous
would be another word I would use.
O'NEILL
Keep talking.
MAYBORNE
I want you to understand that once you see what I'm about to show
you, there is no turning back. You'll have the choice to go along
with it or disappear.
O'NEILL
Disappear?
MAYBORNE
This is your last chance to back out.
O'NEILL
Well if you promise to cut back on the melodrama, I'll consider
crossing the line.
EXT--NIGHT
[A plane is flying through the sky.]
INT--PLANE (NIGHT)
[O'Neill is sitting before Mayborne.]
O'NEILL
So, where are we going?
MAYBORNE
Nowhere in particular. I find being thirty thousand feet up greatly
reduces the chances of any effective surveillance.
[Maybourne sits down and unfolds a device. A gray globe rises up out of
it.]
MAYBORNE
Do you know what this is?
O'NEILL
I assume it's one of those Goa'uld communication...balls.
MAYBORNE
We didn't have to negotiate for it either.
O'NEILL
Who's we?
MAYBORNE
My organisation.
O'NEILL
NID?
MAYBORNE
More of an offshoot.
O'NEILL
Ah. That sort of says it all, doesn't it.
MAYBORNE
I want you to command a unit.
O'NEILL
There are units?
MAYBORNE
Oh yes. Would you like to meet the temporary commander of the unit I
want you to run?
O'NEILL
I guess.
[Mayborne starts fiddling with the device.]
MAYBORNE
Took us a while to figure out how to use this thing without a
Goa'uld at the controls, but good old human ingenuity eventually won
out.
[A man's face appears on the globe.]
MAN
Colonel Mayborne.
MAYBORNE
Newman. I'd like you to meet Colonel Jack O'Neill, retired.
NEWMAN
Colonel O'Neill, it is a pleasure, sir. I've read just about all the
SG-1 mission briefings and, uh, well let's just say your file is
very impressive. It'll be an honour to serve under your command,
Colonel.
O'NEILL
Hello, Newman. You look familiar.
NEWMAN
Uh, yes, sir. We have met briefly. In a hanger at a Utah landing
strip.
O'NEILL
You're one of those kids we chased through the other Stargate.
NEWMAN
Ah, that would be me. I apologise about having to return fire, sir.
O'NEILL
Where are you?
MAYBORNE
He's on another planet.
O'NEILL
Your mission, Newman?
NEWMAN
Use whatever means necessary to acquire goods and technology that
could help Earth in the battle against the Goa'uld, sir. Or other,
unforeseen aggressors.
O'NEILL
Well you've seen my file, Newman, it's only fair I know a little
more about you.
MAYBORNE
Need to know, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Well I need to know if I going to command this unit.
MAYBORNE
You agree to go there and take command, I'll give you detailed files
on every one of your people. Now how about it, Colonel? You ready
for a command where you can finally achieve what you and I both
agree needs to be achieved to defend this planet?
O'NEILL
I never thought I'd agree with you about anything, Mayborne. But
yeah. I'm ready.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE, SGC
Makepeace
Major Carter has accepted my command with no problem, sir, but I'm
afraid Dr Jackson and the Jaffa have not.
HAMMOND
Well maybe if you didn't think of him as 'the Jaffa', it would be a
good start.
[There is a knock at the door.]
HAMMOND
Come in.
[O'Neill, in civilian clothes, enters the office.]
HAMMOND
Jack, come in. You know Colonel Makepeace.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
HAMMOND
How's the retirement going?
O'NEILL
Uh, great. I retire, I wake up, I retire...it's a living. I'm bored
out of my skull, sir.
HAMMOND
I'm sorry to hear that. Something I can help you with?
O'NEILL
Actually there is, General.
MAKEPEACE
Would you like me to leave, Jack?
O'NEILL
I don't care.
HAMMOND
We're not finished Colonel Makepeace.
O'NEILL
I'll make it fast General. I'm hoping you could grant me one last
favour.
HAMMOND
I'm listening.
O'NEILL
I want to retire offworld.
HAMMOND
Jack, I don't know if...
O'NEILL
You remember that woman I told you about on Edora? LAIRA was her
name.
HAMMOND
Yes?
O'NEILL
I promised her I'd come back some day. I'm asking you to help me
keep that promise. Please.
HAMMOND
If I agree to do this, you know I can't give you a GDO. That's means
you can never return to Earth through the Gate.
O'NEILL
I understand that, sir.
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[The Stargate dials up. Hammond, Frasier, Carter and Teal'c are
watching as O'Neill walks up the ramp.]
HAMMOND
Colonel.
[They salute O'Neill, but he doesn't turn around. Daniel is watching
from the Control Room as O'Neill steps through the Gate.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill steps out onto the planet and hurries down the steps to the
DHD. He quickly dials another address.]
INT--OFFWORLD BASE
[O'Neill steps out of the Stargate into a room. A group of men and
women are waiting for him.]
NEWMAN
Colonel O'Neill. It's an honour, sir.
O'NEILL
Newman.
NEWMAN
We may look a little ragtag, but I assure you we're very good at
what we do.
O'NEILL
Which is stealing stuff.
NEWMAN
Well acquiring what we need to defend our planet, Colonel.
O'NEILL
And you measure how good you are by the fact that you've never been
caught?
NEWMAN
And by the spoils of our missions. Would you care to take a gander
at one of our latest acquisitions?
O'NEILL
Sure. I'll take a gander.
NEWMAN
This way, sir.
[O'Neill follows him from the room.]
INT--SCIENCE ROOM, OFFWORLD BASE
[A woman is waiting for them, a glowing, crystal-like device on the
table behind her.]
NEWMAN
What do you think, Colonel?
WOMAN
Just brought it back. It's an antigravitation device.
O'NEILL
Really?
WOMAN
Lieutenant Clare Tobias, sir.
O'NEILL
Tobias, Jack O'Neill.
NEWMAN
If it's alright, sir, I'll leave you in the lieutenant's very
capable hands.
[Newman leaves.]
O'NEILL
(to Tobias)
So, tell me about this thing.
TOBIAS
Well, it utilises super-conducted gyroscopic action to generate an
antigravitational field underneath...
O'NEILL
Stop. Scientist?
TOBIAS
Engineer. Why?
O'NEILL
You remind me of someone in my old command.
TOBIAS
Major Carter.
O'NEILL
How do you know her?
TOBIAS
She beat me out of a position in the SGC.
O'NEILL
Oh. So what do you do around here?
TOBIAS
My job is to examine some of the larger items we acquire, the ones
that are too big to be transported back to Earth. See if we can
backwards engineer them and send the plans home to Colonel Mayborne.
NEWMAN
Excuse me, sir. Colonel Mayborne would like to talk to you.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Tobias.
[He follows Newman out of the room.]
INT--GATE ROOM, OFFWORLD BASE
[Newman activates one of the Goa'uld communication devices and
Mayborne's image appears.]
MAYBORNE
Jack. I see you made it in one piece. What do you think of our
little operation?
O'NEILL
It's swell Harry.
MAYBORNE
We do what we can to make it comfortable. I have your first mission,
Colonel. Planet PX3 595.
NEWMAN
It's about time we got one of those things.
MAYBORNE
SG9 was unable to negotiate to get the device.
O'NEILL
What device are we talking about?
MAYBORNE
Newman can fill you in on all the details. Good luck, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Thanks.
MAYBORNE
And Colonel? Just a reminder, this isn't the SGC, so if someone gets
in your way, do what you have to do.
[The device shuts down.]
INT--GATE ROOM, OFFWORLD BASE
[The team are preparing to leave on the mission. Tobias is dialling up
the Gate.]
NEWMAN
Ok, the mouth of the cave we're going to hit is about 50 metres, 2
o'clock from the Gate. Primitive locals, called Tirnoks, they use
them as a place to hide from predators.
TOBIAS
The predator follows them into the cave, the tirnoks use the device
we're after to...vanish them.
O'NEILL
Very nice.
[They walk up the ramp and enter the Gate.]
VFX--SHOOTING THROUGH WORMHOLE
EXT--CAVES, ALIEN PLANET (NIGHT)
[The team is heading through the caves with guns and flashlights.]
O'NEILL
Clear.
[Tobias spots a device on the wall.]
TOBIAS
Bingo.
[Newman goes over and picks it up.]
NEWMAN
You're going to love this.
[He disappears, then reappears behind O'Neill, making the Colonel
jump.]
NEWMAN
Pretty cool, huh?
O'NEILL
That thing looks Asgard.
TOBIAS
It is. This is an Asgard protected planet.
INT--GATE ROOM, OFFWORLD BASE
[Newman is holding the device they have just stolen.]
NEWMAN
Can you imagine the ways we could use this for black-ops back on
Earth?
O'NEILL
Yep. But it's not back on Earth. Are you going to be able to
backwards engineer this thing?
TOBIAS
Don't have to. Items this small, we just send back to Earth.
O'NEILL
How?
NEWMAN
We've got a man on the inside, on one of the SG teams. Colonel
Mayborne tells us where the mole's team is about to go, we get there
first, make the drop and come back here. The mole comes in later,
retrieves the item and packs it back in his gear.
[The Goa'uld communication device starts up and Mayborne's image
appears on the globe.]
NEWMAN
It's about time he got back to us.
MAYBORNE
Hello team. You get the device?
O'NEILL
Yep.
MAYBORNE
Good. I have the time and coordinates for the drop. Just drop and
go. No contact.
O'NEILL
Right.
MAYBORNE
I'm sending the coordinates. Record them.
[Newman presses a button of the device.]
NEWMAN
Alex?
[He hands the information to another team member.]
NEWMAN
Ready to go, sir.
O'NEILL
No. I'll go.
NEWMAN
Really?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Best way to understand a command is to do every job yourself
at least once.
NEWMAN
It's your prerogative, Colonel.
EXT--Stargate CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)
[O'Neill steps out of the Stargate and hurries over to the DHD, placing
the Asgard device under a pile of rocks there. The Stargate starts to
dial up and he quickly takes cover in some bushes as a SG team steps
out of the event horizon. It's SG-1, led by Colonel Makepeace.]
MAKEPEACE
Alright, let's make this quick. Carter, Dr Jackson, run your tests.
See if the intel was right about naquada deposits here.
[O'Neill watches them through a pair of binoculars. Teal'c comes close
to the DHD, but doesn't pick up the device. Later on, SG-1 returns,
while O'Neill continues to remain hidden. Carter dials up the Stargate,
while Makepeace crouches down by the DHD on the pretext of retying his
shoelace. As O'Neill looks on, Makepeace take the device from under the
stones and pockets it. SG-1 leaves through the Gate. O'Neill hurries
over to the DHD and dials the offworld base, before disappearing
through the Stargate. After he has gone, a bright light appears over
the DHD, and an Asgard is beamed down in time to read the symbols he
dialled on the DHD.]
INT--GATE ROOM, OFFWORLD BASE
NEWMAN
How'd it go, sir?
O'NEILL
Mayborne had the coordinates right, but his timing sucked! I just
about ran into the SG team on my way back through the Gate.
[There is a rumbling noise and the ground starts to shake.]
NEWMAN
What's going on?
[O'Neill doesn't reply, but goes over to the DHD and starts dialling.]
NEWMAN
sir? Sir, we do not open the Gate without direct orders from Colonel
Mayborne. Colonel, what are you doing.
[O'Neill presses the red crystal and the Gate opens.]
O'NEILL
Opening up some options!
[O'Neill punches him.]
TOBIAS
There's an Asgard ship descending over the base!
[She looks up to see O'Neill standing before the event horizon. Lights
start flashing around the base, making the stolen devices disappear.]
TOBIAS
What are they doing?
O'NEILL
Taking back what's rightfully theirs, I guess. Listen up all of you.
You've got two choices here. As soon as they stop taking stuff,
they're going to start taking people. Now you can go with the
Asgard...or you can follow me. Your choice. I'll be holding the door
open so you can't go anywhere else.
[He waves, then goes through the Stargate. Tobias runs for the Gate,
followed by others, as Newman looks on.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[Teal'c is tying Tobias' wrists together as Newman finally steps
through the Gate. O'Neill has his hand through the event horizon, but
he withdraws it, and the Gate shuts down.]
O'NEILL
Good job kids.
(to Makepeace)
Uh, give me one of those.
[Makepeace hands him a pair of plastic handcuffs.]
MAKEPEACE
Here.
[O'Neill quickly grabs him and handcuffs him, while other Airmen point
their sidearms at him.]
MAKEPEACE
What the hell...what are you doing?!
O'NEILL
That would be...my job.
[Hammond comes over, along with Carter and Daniel.]
HAMMOND
(to Mayborne's group)
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce that you're all under
arrest for high crimes against the United States and its allies.
[Travell enters the Gate room.]
MAKEPEACE
You really blew it O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Oh, I think it came off quite nicely, don't you General?
HAMMOND
Yes I do.
MAKEPEACE
You have no idea how high up this goes.
O'NEILL
Like the Tollan, Tok'ra, Asgard, Nox...those folks?
MAKEPEACE
They refuse to give us the things we need to defend ourselves
against the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
We don't need their stuff Makepeace. We do need them.
HAMMOND
Get them out of here.
[Mayborne's people are dragged out of the Gate room.]
DANIEL
So, just to uh, clarify, this whole past week, beginning with the
appeal we made on Tollana in which I did a lot of hard work, by the
way...I take it that was all a scam.
HAMMOND
Within the last two weeks, the Asgard and the Tollan approached us
independently of each other with evidence that we were stealing
technology from them.
CARTER
We? The SGC?
HAMMOND
Yes. The Asgard, the Tollan and the Nox were going to sever all ties
with us. But we convinced them the theft must be the action of a
rogue group from outside the SGC.
TRAVELL
We insisted that you apprehend them yourselves. You have now
regained our trust.
CARTER
So, you set that whole thing up on Tollana in the hopes that the
mole would think you were one of them and approach you?
DANIEL
And you didn't think you could trust us to help?
HAMMOND
We wanted to assure that your reaction to the Colonel's behaviour
was as it should be. And the Asgard insisted that Colonel O'Neill be
the only one involved.
O'NEILL
They like me.
HAMMOND
And now, will you come with me your Eminence?
[He and Travell leave the Gate room.]
O'NEILL
(to his team)
I'm back.
CARTER
(smiling)
It's good to have you back, sir.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[Daniel doesn't say anything.]
O'NEILL
Um, Daniel?
(He gestures for Daniel to walk with him)
That stuff I was talking about at my house...
DANIEL
Uh...
O'NEILL
The place was bugged, I had to keep up the act.
DANIEL
I, it's, I understand.
O'NEILL
And obviously the whole friendship thing, the foundation, it's all
solid.
DANIEL
Obviously, it's, you don't have to...
O'NEILL
Nothing to worry about.
DANIEL
You don't have to...
O'NEILL
No, no, I feel I kinda...I do appreciate that you were the one that
came to see if I was ok. That...that means something.
DANIEL
(halting)
Ah, actually, no it doesn't.
O'NEILL
Huh?
[Daniel exchanges a look with Carter and Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Um, we, uh, we drew straws. I lost.
[Daniel and Carter continue on down the corridor. Teal'c pauses by
O'Neill with a distinctly smug look on his face, then follows, leaving
the Colonel standing there.]
FADE OUT
THE END
