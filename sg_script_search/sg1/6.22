   EXT--ABYDOS

   [Skaara runs through the village to a tent, which he enters.]

     ELDER
     Skaara. Join us.

   [Skaara sit before the semicircle of women.]

     ELDER
     You know why you are here?

     SKAARA
     Then it is true?

     ELDER
     There's not much time. Kasuf will take the women and children to the
     caves of Kalima where they will be safe.

     SKAARA
     No one will be safe anywhere. How can we even hope to defend
     ourselves against a Goa'uld as powerful as Anubis?

     ELDER
     Our lives are meaningless if we don't stop him from finding what he
     seeks here. You must rally all those capable of fighting.

     SKAARA
     All those willing to die.

     DANIEL
     All those who must not fail.

   [Skaara and the Elder look up to see Daniel turning around, dressed in
   Abydonian robes.]

     SKAARA
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     You won't be alone.

   [Skaara smiles and nods. Daniel nods back.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill walks to an elevator on Level 19 and swipes his card. He
   enters and inserts his card by the buttons and presses for Level 28.
   The elevator starts to move, but the lights suddenly go out and the
   elevator stops. O'Neill picks up the phone.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello? This is C.. Hello?

     DANIEL
     Jack?

   [O'Neill puts the phone to his ear again.]

     DANIEL
     Jack. Hi Jack.

   [O'Neill looks sceptical as he turns and sees Daniel. Daniel gives him
   a little wave.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, Abydos is in trouble. Anubis is on his way. He's after the Eye
     of Ra. I have that replica Catherine gave me, it looks like this.

   [Daniel holds up the Eye of Ra medallion to O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Now, I'm pretty sure the real one is located in some secret chamber
     in Ra's pyramid on Abydos but I'm not sure where exactly. According
     to legend there were six Eyes including those held by Apophis,
     Osiris and Tiamat among others. Each is powerful on its own but to
     use them in combination increases that power ten fold. Recently,
     Anubis has managed to track down five of the six Eyes and only needs
     Ra's to complete the set. He's looked everywhere Ra used to hang out
     except Abydos; now he's on his way there.

   [O'Neill still looks bemused and turns to place the handset back on its
   rest.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm sure that was an aspirin I took this morning.

     DANIEL
     Jack, it's really me. It's me, you have to help, you have to find
     the Eye of Ra before Anubis does. Keep it, hide it, destroy it,
     whatever, it doesn't matter, we don't have much time.

     O'NEILL
     Hey Daniel, how you doing? Long time. How are things on the higher
     planes?

   [Daniel turns away from O'Neill, grimaces, then turns back.]

     DANIEL
     Hey Jack, long time no see. H...h...h...how you doing?

     O'NEILL
     Fine, just fine.

     DANIEL
     The knees? The back? Everything's...

     O'NEILL
     Oh you know, kind of weather contingent actually.

     DANIEL
     Right, right, right, right, so, what's new?

     O'NEILL
     Uhm...actually a funny thing happened to me, today. I'm riding an
     elevator and an old friend of mine, someone who never calls, never
     writes...

   [Daniel rolls his eyes.]

     O'NEILL
     ...just shows up and tells me all about this very important and
     apparently urgent mission that needs my attention.

     DANIEL
     You gonna help, or, or...

     O'NEILL
     No, wait, wait! Let me tell it, it's good. You see this buddy of
     mine, this pal, this chum has...ascended to a whole new level of
     existence. Do you see the irony? He's asking for my help and he's
     this great and powerful being.

     DANIEL
     Jack, we've already been through this, I can't actually do anything.

     O'NEILL
     See, I'm still not clear on that.

     DANIEL
     The Others have rules; just talking to you is a violation.

     O'NEILL
     What like jay walking, double parking, what?

     DANIEL
     The point is, taking action that changes human existence, that's a
     big one.

     O'NEILL
     Let me ask you this. Have you met any of these Other guys?

     DANIEL
     No.

     O'NEILL
     Well then, how do you know they're any kind of a threat?

     DANIEL
     Oh good, that's, that's a good one. As it is, Oma's an outcast
     because she believes that helping people ascend is our duty.

     O'NEILL
     And that's...okay?

     DANIEL
     Technically, no. But she does it anyway. Those of us that follow her
     are walking a very fine line.

     O'NEILL
     Why don't they try to stop her?

     DANIEL
     I don't know.

     O'NEILL
     You don't know?

     DANIEL
     No I don't know. All I know is what Oma has taught me. Ascension
     doesn't make you all knowing or all powerful. It is just the
     beginning of the journey. The point is, if I were to help you, if I
     were to take any action to help you, Oma would step in and stop me
     herself to avoid drawing the wrath of the Others. If they wanted to,
     they could stop everything she's been trying to do for a long, long
     time.

   [The lights come on and the elevator starts moving.]

     DANIEL
     I can't jeopardise that.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, Teal'c, Jonas and Hammond are seated at the table, O'Neill is
   walking around.]

     O'NEILL
     Obviously, we can't match forces with Anubis but apparently the
     Abydonians are willing to back us on this one.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, how'd you come by this intel?

     O'NEILL

     (clearing his throat)
     I didn't say?

     HAMMOND
     No, you didn't.

   [O'Neill pauses and clears his throat.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel told me.

   [Carter and Jonas look surprised.]

     JONAS
     You saw Doctor Jackson?

     O'NEILL
     Actually, it's not the first time.

   [Teal'c seems unsettled by O'Neill's news.]

     CARTER
     Is he all right?

     HAMMOND
     What else did he say?

     O'NEILL
     Whoa, wait. You guys don't think I'm nuts...or anything...like that?

     TEAL'C
     I too have recently see Daniel Jackson.

     CARTER
     Really?

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't you say something?

     TEAL'C
     Why did you not?

     O'NEILL
     Well to be honest, I wasn't quite sure it was really happening the
     first time.

     TEAL'C
     Neither was I.

     JONAS
     Did he tell you where we could find the Eye?

     O'NEILL
     Uh, he doesn't know.

     CARTER
     He doesn't know?

     O'NEILL
     I know! Personally I think this whole ascension thing is a bit
     overrated.

     HAMMOND
     That's good enough for me, Colonel. If Dr. Jackson is right, we have
     to find that Eye before Anubis does.

   INT--ABYDOS GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 come through the Gate. Skaara enters.]

     SKAARA
     O'Nieer.

     O'NEILL
     Skaara.

   [They hug.]

     SKAARA
     It is good to see you.

     CARTER
     You too.

     JONAS
     I'm Jonas.

     SKAARA
     Good to meet you.

   [Skaara and Jonas shake hands.]

     TOBAY
     We are prepared to do whatever you ask.

     O'NEILL
     Appreciate that. Teal'c, set up a perimeter, I want to know the
     second we have company.

   [Teal'c leaves.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Skaara)
     Any idea where this Eye thing is?

     SKAARA
     I will show you.

   [Skaara, Tobay, O'Neill, Carter and Jonas walk through into a different
   room lighting torches as they go. They come to some steps and descend.]

     SKAARA
     This is as far as the catacombs go. Daniel and I have spent much
     time here.

     O'NEILL
     No Eyes?

     SKAARA
     The Eye of Ra is mentioned many times on these walls.

     O'NEILL
     Just so we're clear. It's not a real eye. It's a kind of jewel or
     something.

     SKAARA
     Well, we have never been able to find it.

   EXT--ORBIT ABOVE ABYDOS

   [A massive Goa'uld ship exits hyperspace.]

   EXT--ABYDOS

   [Teal'c has set up a perimeter and he and a group of Abydonians are
   outside the pyramid, waiting.]

   INT--PYRAMID

     O'NEILL
     So, you seeing anybody?

     SKAARA
     Maybe.

     O'NEILL
     Really? Is it serious?

     SKAARA

     (smiling)
     We are betrothed.

     O'NEILL
     Trust me, that's serious. Congratulations.

     SKAARA
     Thank you.

     O'NEILL
     I assume my invitation got lost in the mail or..?

     SKAARA
     I wanted to ask you to sha'loki. To stand beside me.

     O'NEILL
     Just...during the ceremony, right?

     SKAARA
     Yes, yes.

     O'NEILL
     I'd be honoured.

     SKAARA
     Will you be coming to my wedding alone?

     O'NEILL
     Ummm...

   [Carter walks up to them.]

     O'NEILL
     I assume Carter's invited too?

     SKAARA

     Of course. Will you becoming together? O'NEILL
     As in?

     CARTER
     Friends going to a wedding.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, yes, sure!

   [O'Neill turns away.]

     O'NEILL
     Jonas?

   [O'Neill walks off and Carter and Skaara just smile.]

   EXT--ABYDOS

   [Teal'c and Tobay are waiting.]

     TEAL'C
     Is there something you wish to ask me?

     TOBAY
     You are a friend of Daniel Jackson?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed I was.

     TOBAY
     Skaara says he is not dead. He is now a God.

     TEAL'C
     A God he is not.

     TOBAY
     Is he not powerful?

     TEAL'C
     That remains unclear.

     TOBAY
     Daniel once brought freedom to my people from the false God Ra. He
     has asked us to fight, we will fight in his name. Die for his cause
     if we must. Skaara says Daniel will protect us, watch over our
     families.

     TEAL'C
     I am unsure as to what you have been promised.

   [Al'kesh and Death Gliders can be seen in the distance.]

     TEAL'C
     But if you are not prepared to die, you should not be here.

   [They raise their weapons as the ships pass overhead.]

   INT--PYRAMID

   [Jonas is reading something on a wall.]

     O'NEILL
     How you doing there, son? We don't have all day.

     JONAS
     I know. Believe me I know. But there's nothing. Just a lot of talk
     about the power of Ra, the size of his domain...

     O'NEILL
     Big domain?

     JONAS
     There's no mention of a secret chamber where he keeps his most
     valuable possessions not that I would expect that.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   [Dull thumps are heard from overhead.]

   EXT--ABYDOS

   [The Death Gliders and Al'kesh are firing on the Abydonians as a cargo
   ship moves in. Teal'c and the Abydonians are firing back with little
   success. The missile from Teal'c's rocket launcher is absorbed by the
   shields of the cargo ship, and the Death Gliders are small enough to
   manoeuvre away.]

   INT--PYRAMID

     TEAL'C

     (via radio)
     O'Neill, we are under attack! Ground forces have landed. We will not
     be able to hold them off for long.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Roger that.
     (To Jonas)
     You heard the man.

     JONAS
     I don't know what to tell you. I mean if Dr. Jackson was here...

     O'NEILL
     Oh he's here. He's definitely here. Trust me, he's here.

   [The sounds of the battle above can be heard.]

     O'NEILL
     Son of a...Hey! Where are you? We're only doing this because of you.

   [Daniel appears behind him.]

     DANIEL
     Jack! It's here, I know it is.

   [Carter walks up to Daniel.]

     CARTER
     Daniel!

   [Daniel turns to both Carter and Jonas, greeting them.]

     DANIEL
     Sam. Jonas.

     JONAS
     Dr. Jackson.

   [The sound of the battle rages.]

     O'NEILL

     (pointing to the roof)
     You hear that?

     DANIEL
     I can't do anything about that, you know.

     O'NEILL
     I don't care. Do something or we walk. Right now.

     DANIEL
     Remember that fine line we were talking about?

     O'NEILL
     Cross it.

   [Daniel turns away, nods and sighs.]

     DANIEL

     (quietly)
     Okay.

   [He walks towards another part of the pyramid.]

     DANIEL
     I always thought there might be a secret chamber here.

   [Daniel walks to a wall, followed by Skaara, Carter, O'Neill and
   Jonas.]

     DANIEL
     This section talks about how Ra draws his power from the sun.

     TEAL'C

     (via radio)
     O'Neill, we cannot hold our position.

     O'NEILL

     (into Radio)
     Fall back to the pyramid.
     (To the others in the pyramid)
     You guys do your stuff, I'm gonna go help Teal'c.

     SKAARA
     I will come with you.

   [They leave. Carter, Jonas and Daniel inspect the wall.]

   EXT--ABYDOS

   [Teal'c is moving everyone back.]

     TEAL'C
     Fall back. Fall back!

   [They fall back as a glider comes towards them. Teal'c fires his rocket
   launcher and the glider explodes as it hits the ground. Two Abydonians
   fall but Teal'c keeps running.]

   INT--PYRAMID

     CARTER
     Ummm...can't you just...zip into the wall and see if there's
     something on the other side?

     DANIEL
     It's complicated.

     JONAS
     Some kind of trigger for a secret door. Rays of the sun will reveal
     all. Rays of the sun, there's no sunlight. Think any light will do?

     DANIEL
     It's possible.

   [Jonas gets out a torch and shines it on the jewel in the wall.]

     CARTER
     Maybe you need to focus it a little?

     JONAS
     Yeah.

   [Jonas gets out a magnifying glass from his pack as Daniel walks to
   him.]

     DANIEL
     Is that my stuff?

     JONAS
     You weren't using it any more.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [Jonas focuses the light through the magnifying glass.]

   INT--PYRAMID ENTRANCE

   [Teal'c and the Abydonians have reached the pyramid as Jaffa come
   pouring over the hill. O'Neill and Skaara meet Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     How many?

     TEAL'C
     Many.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Carter?

     CARTER

     (Via radio)
     Sir, we're working on it.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Work faster.

   INT--PYRAMID

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Yes sir.

     JONAS
     I thought we were on to something.

     DANIEL
     You were.

     JONAS
     It's not working.

   [Daniel steps back slightly from the wall to look at the image on the
   wall in its entirety.]

     DANIEL
     It's red.

     JONAS
     What is?

     DANIEL
     The rays of the sun on the fresco are...are red. Sam?

     CARTER
     Yeah. Jonas?

   [Carter focuses the red laser sight on her P90 on the jewel and the
   door opens.]

     JONAS
     Sweet.

   [They enter the dark secret room and look around, lighting fire torches
   as they go. The room is full of artefacts.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [Jaffa enter and are fired on. A chunk of rock is taken out near
   O'Neill. The man in front of Skaara is killed. More Jaffa ring into the
   middle of the room. Most of the Jaffa are taken out by O'Neill but one
   manages to fire on Skaara who is injured. Teal'c provides cover fire
   for O'Neill who goes to check on Skaara.]

   INT--PYRAMID SECRET CHAMBER

   [Daniel is looking at a tablet.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, what is it?

     DANIEL

     (amazed)
     I'm an Ancient.

     CARTER
     What?

     DANIEL
     Not me, but the Others like me. They're the Ancients.

   [Jonas comes up to read the tablet.]

     JONAS
     This is written in one of the oldest dialects of the Ancients.

     DANIEL
     I mean I always suspected but I never really knew for sure.

     CARTER
     What does it say?

     DANIEL
     It says that the Ancients evolved from a race of humans that lived
     long before us. They were wiped out by a plague that was sweeping
     across the galaxy and that many learned to ascend, and the rest died
     out. I have to go.

     CARTER
     Where?

     DANIEL
     I'll be back. Don't lose that tablet; it talks about a lost city
     that's more valuable than anything.

     CARTER
     Daniel?

   [Daniel begins to glow and leaves the room as brilliant white energy.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate engages.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

   [Teal'c retreats towards him.]

   INT--PYRAMID SECRET CHAMBER

   [Jonas and Carter are rummaging through the artefacts.]

     JONAS
     What if it's not here?

     CARTER
     Maybe there's a secret compartment?

     JONAS
     A secret compartment inside a secret chamber?

     CARTER
     Why not?

     JONAS
     Why not?

   [Jonas picks up a metal object and starts tapping walls. He comes
   across one that sounds hollow.]

     JONAS
     Right here.

   [Carter comes towards him as Jonas clears the area in front of the
   wall.]

     JONAS
     I don't see a latch or a jewel like with the other door but there's
     got to be some way to open this.

     CARTER
     Yeah. Stand back.

   [Carter fires at the wall with her P90. When a big part of the wall
   disintegrates, Jonas retrieves the Eye of Ra and they leave the
   chamber. Jonas picks up the tablet as he passes.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Sir, we got it.

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Skaara come down the steps to meet them.]

     O'NEILL
     Too late.

     TEAL'C
     We cannot hold the Gate room. Anubis dialled the Stargate preventing
     our escape.

     O'NEILL
     We got Jaffa on our ass. Where's that Eye?

     JONAS
     Right here.

   [O'Neill gets some C4 out of his vest pocket.]

     JONAS
     What are you going to do with that?

     O'NEILL
     I'm gonna see how much Anubis wants that thing in one piece.

   [The Jaffa come down the steps and wait. O'Neill attaches the C4 to the
   Eye as another Jaffa comes down the steps.]

     HERAK
     Surrender or die!

     O'NEILL
     What?

     HERAK
     Surrender or die!

     O'NEILL
     I was just gonna say the exact same thing.

     HERAK
     O'Neill, of SG-1.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, how you doing? You'll have to forgive me, I'm terrible with
     names. What was...

   [A staff is fired.]

     O'NEILL
     Jeez!

   [Teal'c is crouched over a semiconscious Skaara.]

     HERAK
     I am Herak.

     O'NEILL
     Congratulations. Failing upwards I see.

     HERAK
     You have no choice.

     O'NEILL
     Actually I do. I've got the Eye and about a pound of very powerful
     explosives stuck to it. Give us clear access to the Gate or I'll
     blow it up.

     HERAK
     Yourself along with it?

     O'NEILL
     What's your point?

     HERAK
     I will speak with my master.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, you do that. Don't forget to tell him you screwed up again.

   [Herak leaves, though a number of Jaffa remain.]

     JONAS
     Is it really necessary to further antagonise him?

     O'NEILL
     Yes.

     CARTER
     Would you really do it?

     O'NEILL
     Sure, why not?

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

   [O'Neill walks over to Teal'c and Skaara.]

     TEAL'C
     Skaara is in need of medical attention.

     SKAARA
     I have failed you.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, stop it.

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

   [Herak walks in and kneels.]

     HERAK
     My Lord. Humans from Earth and the one named O'Neill have found the
     Eye of Ra. We have them trapped. But he says if we do not grant them
     free passage he will destroy the Eye.

     ANUBIS
     He will give you the Eye of Ra or I will destroy Abydos.

     HERAK
     Yes my Lord.

   [Herak leaves.]

     DANIEL
     You won't touch Abydos.

     ANUBIS
     And how will you stop me?

     DANIEL
     I can. And I will, if one more person down there is hurt.

     ANUBIS
     You can do nothing but stand there and utter empty threats because I
     know what you are.

     DANIEL
     If you know what I am, you know very well I can wipe you from
     existence.

     ANUBIS
     I know who you are Daniel Jackson, but you know not who I am.

   [Anubis' face starts to glow. He is an ascended being.]

   INT--PYRAMID

   [Herak enters.]

     HERAK
     O'Neill, can you hear me?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     HERAK
     Anubis commands that you turn over the Eye of Ra immediately or he
     will destroy all of Abydos.

     O'NEILL
     Tell him to go ahead. He's not getting the Eye.

   [Jonas looks at O'Neill, sceptical.]

     O'NEILL
     He's bluffing.

     JONAS
     We don't have much of a choice. If we blow up the Eye he's going to
     destroy Abydos anyway.

     O'NEILL
     He's just as likely to attack after we give it to him.

     JONAS
     Maybe not.

     O'NEILL
     He's a Goa'uld. Huh!

     SKAARA

     (faintly)
     O'Nyer.

   [O'Neill goes to Skaara, who is shivering and semiconscious. Skaara
   starts to talk in Abydonian.]

     O'NEILL
     What's he say?

     TEAL'C
     He speaks of a bright light. Of giving up. Of releasing something.

   [Skaara looks at O'Neill. His eyes close and he dies. Suddenly, he
   turns into a bright light and ascends. The Jaffa outside look puzzled
   at the bright light, while Teal'c looks up at the light in amazement.
   O'Neill looks down at Skaara's empty clothes.]

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

     ANUBIS
     With a wave of my hand, I will bombard the surface. You can try and
     stop me if you choose.

     DANIEL
     What makes you think I won't?

     ANUBIS
     Your words mean nothing. Take action if you dare.

   [Daniel walks towards the viewing screen where Goa'uld motherships exit
   hyperspace. Daniel turns back to Anubis.]

     DANIEL
     Maybe I won't have to.

   [Yu appears on the viewing screen.]

     YU
     I command the collective forces of the System Lords.

     ANUBIS
     You've finally managed to rally them against me.

     YU
     You hand over the Eye of Ra or face destruction.

     ANUBIS
     I will consider your most generous offer.

   [Yu disappears.]

     DANIEL
     You won't survive that many motherships.

     ANUBIS
     They are not attacking because they fear me.

     DANIEL
     Maybe. Maybe I'll tell them you don't have the Eye, And they can
     beat you if they strike now.

     ANUBIS
     Do you know that for a fact?

     DANIEL
     Maybe I'll deliver the Eye of Ra to you. If you give me your word
     you won't harm the people of Abydos. Ever.

     ANUBIS
     So be it.

     DANIEL
     That's a promise I'll hold you to no matter what.

   INT--PYRAMID SECRET CHAMBER

   [O'Neill leans into the doorway and waves at the Jaffa.]

     CARTER
     Sir, you're not considering shooting our way out?

     O'NEILL
     No. No, Anubis must really want that thing in one piece if his boys
     have held off this long.

     DANIEL
     He does.

     CARTER
     Where were you?

     DANIEL
     Busy, busy.

     O'NEILL
     Hey! Thanks for Skaara. I assume he's okay.

     DANIEL
     What are you talking about?

     TEAL'C
     He has ascended.

     DANIEL
     What?

     O'NEILL
     That wasn't you?

   [Daniel closes his eyes.]

     DANIEL
     Oma's here watching me.

     O'NEILL
     And?

     DANIEL
     And I don't care any more. Anubis is one of us.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     At least partly in some...bastardised way.

     CARTER
     Daniel, what are you talking about?

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld Anubis used to be figured out how to ascend.

     TEAL'C
     He was believed to have been dead for quite some time.

     DANIEL
     The Others didn't want him.

     JONAS
     That's understandable.

     DANIEL
     They sent him back. At least they tried, but not all the way.

     CARTER
     What is he now?

     DANIEL
     He's still some form of energy, that black mask is a shield, it's
     keeping his form intact. He's stuck somewhere between human
     existence and ascension.

     TEAL'C
     Why have the Others allowed him to remain that way?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. Maybe they couldn't exile him completely.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe they just don't care?

     DANIEL
     Maybe you're right. Either way he's still very powerful.

     CARTER
     It explains his mastery of Ancient technology.

     O'NEILL

     How's that? DANIEL
     Jack, the Others are the Ancients. The original creators of the
     Stargates.

   [O'Neill looks puzzled and Daniel turns to Carter.]

     DANIEL
     You didn't tell him?

     CARTER
     Uh, no.

   [Herak and his men move forward.]

     O'NEILL
     All right look, just bottom line this for me, will you?

     DANIEL
     There's a fleet of System Lord Motherships surrounding Anubis, I
     warned them about the Eye and what it can do.

     O'NEILL
     Nice.

     DANIEL
     Turn it over.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     I made a deal with Anubis, you turn the Eye over, you go free and
     the people of Abydos remain unharmed.

     O'NEILL
     You made a deal with Anubis?

     DANIEL
     I'll make sure he keeps it. The Goa'uld are going to fight it out
     over the Eye and hopefully destroy each other in the process but
     even if they don't, while they're licking their wounds, you're gonna
     find the lost city of the Ancients.

     O'NEILL
     The lost city?

     DANIEL
     Didn't tell him about that either, huh?

     CARTER
     Daniel found a tablet talking about a lost city.

     DANIEL
     Where there are powerful Ancient weapons capable of giving you a big
     advantage over Anubis.

     O'NEILL
     Do you know where it is?

     DANIEL
     No, but I'll help you find it. Jack, nothing will happen to the
     Abydonians, the most important thing right now is for you to get out
     of here with that tablet. If Anubis gets his hands on it and finds
     the lost city before you do, it's all over. He already has a huge
     advantage over you because of what the Others have done or rather
     failed to do.

     O'NEILL
     You gonna kick his ass?

     DANIEL
     If I have to.

     O'NEILL
     Can you?

     DANIEL
     We'll see. Nothing will happen to the people of Abydos.

   INT--PYRAMID

   [The Jaffa are standing guard over the secret chamber.]

     O'NEILL
     Coming out!

   [O'Neill, holding the booby-trapped Eye, walks up to Herak.]

     O'NEILL
     I assume you know about the part where you don't kill us?

     HERAK
     As much as I would like to.

   [O'Neill removes the explosives and hands over the Eye.]

     HERAK
     Jaffa! Kree!

   [The Jaffa all leave.]

     O'NEILL
     Well spank me rosy! Let's book.

   [SG-1 leave.]

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

   [Herak enters the bridge with the Eye of Ra.]

     HERAK
     My Lord, the Eye of Ra.

   [Anubis gets up and removes the Eye from its casing. Herak walks over
   to the viewscreen. The top of the ship opens and a weapon activates.]

     ANUBIS
     The ship's weapons are now fully powered.

   [Yu appears on the view screen.]

     YU
     Your time is up.

     ANUBIS
     Of that you are gravely mistaken.

   [The ship fires on the other Motherships which return fire. There are
   at least ten motherships, many of which explode. Anubis' shields absorb
   the blasts from the other ships.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [Jonas joins the others, having looked outside.]

     JONAS
     Sounds like a hell of a battle going on up there.

   [There are numerous sets of clothes lying on the floor, shaped as
   bodies.]

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

   [Herak is watching the other ships explode.]

     HERAK
     They are retreating.

     ANUBIS
     Yes.

     HERAK
     What now, My Lord?

     ANUBIS
     Now I will destroy Abydos.

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [Carter dials the Gate, which engages.]

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

   [Anubis raises his hand to activate the weapon.]

     DANIEL
     Stop!

   [Herak fires on Daniel but the shot passes through him.]

     ANUBIS
     Stop me, if you can.

   [Herak kneels behind them. Daniel raises his hands, in which appear
   glowing orbs.]

     ANUBIS
     Strike me down. Do it now or I will destroy Abydos.

   [Daniel raises his hands and directs the energy at Anubis. The energy
   is blown back as Anubis raises his hand to defend himself. Herak cowers
   on the floor.]

     DANIEL
     No! Don't do this!

   [Daniel is spirited away.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [Carter, Jonas and Teal'c step through the Gate, O'Neill taking up the
   rear.]

   INT--ANUBIS' SHIP

   [Herak looks frightened.]

     HERAK
     You are indeed all powerful my Lord.

     ANUBIS
     What you just saw was not my doing. However, this is.

   [Anubis activates the weapon which is aimed at Abydos. A beam of energy
   is directed at the pyramid.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill is just about to step through the Gate. He turns and sees
   electricity beans shot around the room.]

   EXT--ABYDOS

   [The pyramid is blown up and the energy wave radiates outwards.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Jonas, Carter and Teal'c are waiting at the bottom of the ramp. The
   wormhole fritzes.]

     JONAS
     What was that?

   [O'Neill comes through and the iris closes. The room shakes as O'Neill
   walks down the ramp.]

     JONAS
     What just happened?

     O'NEILL
     Abydos was hit.

     CARTER

     You saw it?

     O'NEILL
     I felt it. Just before I came through.

   [Carter leaves the Gate room.]

     CARTER
     Sergeant, call up a full Gate diagnostic.

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER
     What have you got?

     SGT. DAVIS
     I'm working on it. A large burst of energy was transmitted through
     the wormhole just after Colonel O'Neill came through.

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     We're lucky they closed the iris when they did, Sir. A massive
     energy wave followed you through the wormhole.

     O'NEILL
     Redial.

     SGT. DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

   [Hammond enters the Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Welcome back SG-1. What's happened?

     CARTER
     Seems there was a large explosion on the planet just after we left,
     Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Is that possible?

     O'NEILL
     Unfortunately, Sir.

     CARTER
     We're dialling Abydos now to see what happened.

     SGT. DAVIS
     Chevron 6 encoded. Chevron 7 will not lock.

     HAMMOND
     Briefing room.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond is holding the stone tablet.]

     CARTER
     The only thing we can assume is that Anubis didn't keep his deal
     with Daniel.

     O'NEILL
     That's a shock, eh?

     TEAL'C
     And that Daniel Jackson was unable to prevent Anubis from destroying
     Abydos.

     HAMMOND
     Which leaves Anubis in possession of a powerful weapon that has
     given him clear superiority over the System Lords.

     O'NEILL
     We don't know any of that for sure, Sir.

     JONAS
     What we do know, is we need to find the city that's described on
     that tablet.

   [Hammond puts the tablet on the table and pushes it towards Jonas.]

     HAMMOND
     Can you translate this?

     JONAS
     Oh yeah. It will take some time but Dr. Jackson did offer his
     assistance.

     CARTER
     I'm not sure that we can count on Daniel for anything any more.

     HAMMOND
     Why not?

     CARTER
     Well, Sir, he would have done everything in his power to protect the
     people of Abydos. If he was somehow prevented from doing that
     then...

   [O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Jonas look worried and uncomfortable.]

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Gate is dialling.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

     SGT. DAVIS
     Chevron 5 encoded. Major, if you don't mind me asking, how many
     times are we going to dial Abydos before you give up?

     CARTER
     Until a Tok'ra with a ship flies over the planet and tells me
     there's no one left alive.

     SGT. DAVIS
     Chevron 6 encoded. Chevron 7...locked.

   [The wormhole engages.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     CARTER
     The MALP shows the pyramid is intact. No evident damage.

     HAMMOND
     What about the explosion?

     CARTER
     I don't know, Sir, I can't explain it.

     O'NEILL
     I'd like to go, Sir. Make sure the people are okay.

   [Hammond indicates his agreement. Carter and O'Neill leave.]

   INT--PYRAMID GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 step through. There is no sign of any damage.]

   INT--ABYDOS VILLAGE

   [SG-1 walk towards the village where there are a lot of people. Some
   boys are playing football.]

     JONAS
     I guess everybody's all right.

   [O'Neill sees Skaara and walks over to him.]

     O'NEILL
     Skaara.

     SKAARA
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     What's going on here?

     SKAARA
     Anubis destroyed the pyramid. Everyone was killed in the blast.

   [The team look around.]

     O'NEILL
     They don't look dead to me. But then neither do you.

     SKAARA
     Death is only the beginning of one's journey.

     O'NEILL
     That sounds familiar.

     TEAL'C
     What of Daniel Jackson?

     SKAARA
     I have not seen Daniel.

     CARTER
     Do you know if he's okay?

     SKAARA
     I do not know. One named Oma did this.

     O'NEILL
     All of you?

     SKAARA
     I wish you well O'Neill. You will not see me again. At least not for
     a while.

     O'NEILL
     Take care.

     SKAARA
     Do not fear. You will find your way.

   [A football rolls in front of O'Neill. He bends down to pick it up.]

     O'NEILL
     What do you mean by that?

   [As he straightens, all the people and tents are gone. Skaara takes the
   ball from him.]

     SKAARA
     The Chappa'ai will remain until you leave.

   [They all turn and see the Stargate in the desert, not in the pyramid.
   When they turn back, Skaara is gone.]

     O'NEILL
     Let's go home.

   [They turn and walk towards the Stargate.]

   FADE OUT
