INT--SGC: GATE ROOM
[From Episode "2010"--a piece of paper falls through the open Stargate
onto the ramp. O'Neill reads it.]
HAMMOND
What is it?
O'NEILL
You tell me.
DANIEL
(Reading the paper)
"Under no circumstances go to P4C-970. Colonel O'Neill." This looks
like your handwriting.
O'NEILL
That is my handwriting.
(Looks at the paper)
And it's my signature.
JANET
That looks like blood, Sir.
HAMMOND
(To Sergeant Davis)
I want P4C-970 removed from the dialling computer immediately.
CARTER
I wonder why you sent it. I wonder when?
[Back to the present--the Gate opens. SG-1 return through the Gate.]
HAMMOND
Welcome back SG-1.
O'NEILL
Break out the fishing gear, General--our job here is done.
HAMMOND
I take it your mission was successful?
CARTER
In a word, Sir--yes.
O'NEILL
In two words--yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
Your initial report said the Volians were a simple agrarian society.
O'NEILL
That they are.
DANIEL
The Volians introduced us to another race, friends of theirs.
O'NEILL
Who, while lacking a sense of humour, make up for it in advanced
technology.
CARTER
They just wanted to make sure that we were trustworthy first.
O'NEILL
Long story short--I think we just carried out our standing orders,
Sir.
TEAL'C
Indeed. We may have found a race both willing and capable of
defending this world against the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
And if that little outburst didn't convince you...
HAMMOND
I'm convinced.
O'NEILL
We just wrapped up several hours of talks with a guy named...
DANIEL
Borren.
O'NEILL
Borren, who really lacks a sense of humour. But he wants the
negotiations to move up to state level.
HAMMOND
Well done people. Perhaps while I inform the President, you could
prepare a mission briefing.
[He turns to go.]
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
(Turning back)
By the way--what do our new friends call themselves?
CARTER
The Aschen, Sir. They're called the Aschen.
END OF TEASER--OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter is making a presentation. A planetary map is shown on the
board.]
CARTER
So, out of security concerns, the Aschen wish not to reveal the
location of their home world until we have an agreement.
[A group of senior officials and military officers are shown listening
to Carter's presentation.]
O'NEILL
They're a little paranoid.
DANIEL
It seems appropriate since they don't have an iris like ours.
CARTER
We do know that they've actually created a secondary star in the
Volian system by igniting a gas giant thereby doubling the Volians'
growing season.
JOE FAXON
They made a star? How?
CARTER
Well, theoretically, by increasing the density of a sufficiently
massive gas giant until a thermonuclear reaction could take place.
In fact, Arthur C Clark posited that...
O'NEILL
(Interrupting)
Ambassador, you gotta be careful about the use of the word "how"
unless you really want to know.
JOE
My mistake, Colonel.
CARTER
I guess my point is, the achievement itself goes a long way to prove
the Aschen are advanced enough to take on the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
The Aschen could be formidable allies.
HAMMOND
If they are Stargate capable, why is this the first we've heard of
them?
DANIEL
That's a good question. They have ships, but they only use them to
travel between the planets within the confederation.
HAMMOND
Of which the Volian system is a part.
DANIEL
Right. Uh, Borren said that both the Aschen and Volian gates were
discovered buried like ours was, and no DHD was ever recovered.
CARTER
Naturally, the Aschen tried dialling numerous symbol combinations,
but without a DHD to compensate for stellar drift, they were stuck
just like we were.
HAMMOND
We could only go to Abydos.
CARTER
Exactly. It was only after Daniel's discovery of the cartouche on
Abydos that we were able to make the drift calculations to
successfully dial other planets. Add to that the database that
Colonel O'Neill retrieved from the library of the Ancients, we can
offer access to an entire galaxy of worlds and races the Aschen
never even knew existed.
HAMMOND
The news must have come as a shock to them.
O'NEILL
Ah, not really.
DANIEL
What Jack is trying to say is that if they were surprised, they'd
never show it.
O'NEILL
They don't get excited in general General. It's like an entire
planet of accountants.
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill mistrusts the Aschen.
O'NEILL
I didn't say that.
TEAL'C
Indeed you did--on several occasions.
O'NEILL
No, I didn't. What I said was, I didn't trust people without a sense
of humour. Especially that boring guy.
TEAL'C
Borren.
O'NEILL
I know his name. He was boring.
HAMMOND
The Aschen have agreed to meet our representative on P3A-194
tomorrow. Colonel O'Neill, both you and Major Carter are to make
yourselves available to the Ambassador as consultants.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson, in the meantime, I'd like you and Teal'c to confer
with the Volians, find out how they feel about the Aschen.
DANIEL
I can tell you their feelings right now, Sir.
HAMMOND
Dig a little deeper. Find out from the Volians if the Aschen are the
good neighbours they seem to be. You embark at 0700. Gentlemen...
[As everyone starts to leave, Joe Faxon walks up to Carter.]
JOE
Major Carter? Since we're trading knowledge of the Stargate, I, uh,
could use a little more of that knowledge myself.
CARTER
After you, Ambassador.
[Joe Faxon and Carter walk down to the Control Room.]
JOE
This place never ceases to amaze me.
CARTER
(To Sergeant Davis)
Anything yet?
DAVIS
Uh, the computer should have it down to a handful of candidates by
tomorrow.
JOE
Candidates?
CARTER
Yeah. We're trying to locate the position of the Aschen home planet.
JOE
How can you do that without the coordinates?
CARTER
How?
JOE
Oh, I asked that question again.
CARTER
In my early work with the Stargate program, I theorised that all
things being equal, the outside limit per lock between two planets
without a DHD is three hundred light years. The computer is
searching for viable coordinates within that radius of the Volian
system, P3A-194.
JOE
Because the Aschen homeworld is somewhere within this area?
CARTER
There's a seventy percent probability.
JOE
Well, if the Aschen are so powerful, why don't they want us to know?
CARTER
Until we share our database with them, they have only our word of
what's out there. They're vulnerable. If we didn't have an iris, I
think we'd do the same.
JOE
You know what? I haven't eaten since
(He looks at his watch)
ooh--today.
CARTER
The Mess is this way. If you'd like, we can talk more there.
JOE
I'd like that very much.

[The blast doors to the Gate room slide open. SG-1 look at Joe Faxon as
he enters, dressed in a smart suit.]
JOE
Morning.
[O'Neill looks down at Joe's shoes.]
O'NEILL
This is what you're wearing?
JOE
What's wrong with it?
TEAL'C
Nothing.
DAVIS

Right. They said I didn't have to wear a uniform. I just want to
make a good impression.

You look great. Very sharp.

Thank you.

Teal'c walk through the event horizon. Carter moves up beside Joe.]
HAMMOND
(In Control Room)
Enjoy the ride, Ambassador. We'll look forward to your return.
CARTER
(To Joe)
After you.
JOE
Thank you.
[Joe and Carter walk up the ramp and step through the event horizon.]
EXT--The Volian planet. The Stargate is situated on a dirt road amid
green fields.
[Joe and Carter join O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel who are standing near
the Gate.]
JOE
Hey, it looks just like uh...
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah. Just when you think you're not in Kansas anymore--turns
out you are.
DANIEL
We'll--see what we can dig up.
O'NEILL
Have fun.
JOE
Uh--you said the Volians and the Aschen enjoy a long trade
relationship, but there aren't any signs of trade infrastructure
around the Stargate.
[A thrumming sound is heard, together with the familiar chevron-locking
clunk.]
JOE
What is that sound?
O'NEILL
Have a look.
[The Stargate is slowly moving to a horizontal position, as a large
ship hovers over it.]
CARTER
It's called a harvester. The Aschen has provided hundreds of them
all over the planet. When a field is ready, the machine harvests the
crop, and then brings it to the Stargate for transport to the Aschen
Homeworld.
[The Gate kawooshes open and a stream of grain falls from the harvester
through the Gate.]
O'NEILL
We're gonna want a few of those.
BORREN
(Approaching the team.)
I'm sure that can be arranged, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Borren.
BORREN
Colonel, I thought I made it clear your weapons were unnecessary.
O'NEILL
Oh, I thought you were joking around. You know, like you always do?
CARTER
Borren, may I introduce our official representative--Ambassador
Joseph Faxon of the United States.
[Joe takes a step forward and goes to shake hands]
JOE
I bring you greetings from...
BORREN
(Interrupting)
I am not your counterpart. The harvester possesses a suitable
compartment. This way please.
O'NEILL
(To Joe)
Shoes.
[They all follow Borren.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
(Entering Control Room.)
Sergeant, you have something?
DAVIS
Yes, Sir. Let me show you on the Star Map. We calculated a total of
five possible Stargate coordinates within a three hundred light year
radius of P3A-194, the Volian System.
HAMMOND
And there's a good chance one of them is the Aschen world?
DAVIS
(He indicates various planets on the map.) Well, of the five, these
three were just calculated, so they're unexplored, this one was
determined uninhabitable by a MALP probe three years ago. But, Sir,
this one--this Gate was blocked out of our dialling computer by your
order, seven months ago.
HAMMOND
You're telling me that there's a one in four chance that the Aschen
home world is a planet that I ordered off limits?
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
Sergeant, have SG teams 3, 12, and 15 report to the briefing room as
soon as possible.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
[Sergeant Davis exits, leaving Hammond studying the Star Map.]
EXT- A FIELD ON THE VOLIAN PLANET
DANIEL
(Calling to a farmer)
Keel? It's uh, Daniel Jackson, and Teal'c.
KEEL
You said you'd not likely be this way again.
DANIEL
Yeah, we wanted to learn more about your relationship with the
Aschen.
KEEL
What would you like to know?
TEAL'C
If they are honourable.
DANIEL
Yeah. I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
KEEL
They've been friends to us since I remember. I was raised by an
Aschen family. Orphan. They give medicine freely, machines freely,
light and heat for our homes.
DANIEL
Really? So, they've never been...unreasonable with your people in
any way?
KEEL
They just float around in their harvesters mostly, what few of them
there are.
TEAL'C
Then you maintain freedom from their world?
KEEL
If freedom is being left alone--we have it.
DANIEL
Okay. Well, thank you.
KEEL
Uh--when next you speak to one--tell him I got iron root in my south
field. I can't dig it out myself. Need one of their machines.
DANIEL
Iron root? Well, maybe we can help.
EXT--A FIELD ON THE VOLIAN WORLD.
[Borren steps up onto a pedestal.]
BORREN
Stand here.
[Carter, O'Neill and Joe join Borren on the pedastal. Borren keys in a
code and the group is transported up to the ship which is hovering
overhead.]
INT--THE ASCHEN HARVESTER SHIP
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah. We're gonna want a few of these, too.
[Mollem is waiting for them as they arrive.]
BORREN
Ambassador, allow me to introduce your counterpart from our
confederation--Mollem.
[Joe holds out his hand, which Mollem ignores.]
JOE
I offer greetings from our President and hope that we can forge a
friendship that can enrich both our peoples.
MOLLEM
This seating arrangement is suitable for our negotiations. Please...
[As the others move towards the meeting room, O'Neill waits behind to
speak to Borren]
O'NEILL
I assume there are facilities on board?
BORREN
In the next compartment.
O'NEILL
Just wanted to make sure before we flew off somewhere.
BORREN
The harvester will remain in the general vicinity of the Stargate
throughout the negotiations.
O'NEILL
Okay. Mind if I check out the view first?
[He moves to a balcony and looks out over the fields. He speaks into
his radio.]
Daniel, Teal'c? We're on board one of their harvesters. When you get
back, report to Hammond, let him know the proceedings have begun.
Over.</blockquote>
EXT--A FIELD ON THE VOLIAN PLANET
DANIEL
(Into radio)
Copy that. And uh--good luck.
KEEL
Here it is.
[An iron girder is sticking out of the ground.]
KEEL
And it goes deep, I'll tell you that.
DANIEL
Keel, we can probably take care of that with Teal'c'sstaff weapon.
TEAL'C
General Hammond's request was to gather information.
DANIEL
Well, he also said we should dig a little deeper.
KEEL
There's a jug of my best sweet water in it for you if you manage.
[Keel leaves. Daniel kneels down and begins to clear earth from around
the girder.]
TEAL'C
Have you discovered something, Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
Oh, God! I hope not. Probably, though.
INT--THE ASCHEN HARVESTER SHIP
MOLLEM
Our position is straightforward. You have discovered the means of
travel between Stargates throughout the galaxy--several hundred
worlds, I'm told?
JOE
Yes.
MOLLEM
And you seek technologies for the purposes of defense against
hostile races you have encountered on these travels?
JOE
Yes, we do.
MOLLEM
We agree in principle to provide you with these defence
technologies--and much more. In exchange for your full disclosure of
this Stargate network.
JOE
And we also agree--in principle.
INT--A HIDDEN CAVERN BELOW THE VOLIAN PLANET
[Daniel climbs down the iron girder to join Teal'c in the underground
cavern.]
TEAL'C
An ancient city once stood here.
DANIEL
I don't know about ancient, certainly extinct. I'm not one to get
caught up in semantics here, but even if there was a city here just
a few hundred years ago--what happened?
INT--THE ASCHEN HARVESTER SHIP
MOLLEM
What is the current population of Earth?
JOE
Well, if you can forgive me, I don't know the exact number--uh,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of six billion.
CARTER
Growing at a rate of several million a year.
MOLLEM
That growth rate is unsustainable.
JOE
We agree.
MOLLEM
You represent the dominant nation?
JOE
That is a fair assessment.
MOLLEM
And, so, are you taking military action to curtail this growth rate?
JOE
No, we respect the sovereignty of our neighbours.
MOLLEM
We are pleased to hear that. The worlds of the confederation are a
partnership of equals.
[There is a sudden loud noise.]
BORREN
Do not be alarmed. The harvester is continuing its normal
operations.
MOLLEM
While you may respect these neighbours, you have not yet revealed to
them the existence of your Stargate.
JOE
Not to all.
MOLLEM
Any treaty between the Aschen Confederation and the people of Earth
must be with all the people of Earth.
JOE
I think we can agree to that.
INT THE ABANDONED CITY BENEATH THE VOLIAN PLANET
DANIEL
The level of technology appears to be similar to early 20th century
Earth, I'd say circa 1910.
TEAL'C
There appears to be no sign of battle, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
I can tell you that barring natural disaster, it generally takes the
forces of nature several centuries to bury a city. This place looks
like it was just ploughed over recently.
TEAL'C
Perhaps to create farmland.
DANIEL
Maybe the Volians have their version of a Luddite movement. Whoever
did this, the Volians or the Aschen, they probably did it long after
the city was already abandoned.
TEAL'C
There are no human remains.
DANIEL
Exactly. So, the question is why?
[Daniel looks towards the ruin of a once-ornate building.]
DANIEL
This looks like it may have been a public building of some sort. I'm
going to go inside and take a look around.
TEAL'C
It may be extremely dangerous.
[Standing at the entrance to the building.]
DANIEL
Yes, it may. I'm gonna go inside, take a look around.
[Teal'c follows Daniel into the building.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
(Addressing three SG team leaders)
Several months ago, we received a message through the Stargate, that
simply stated " Under no circumstances, go to P4C-970".
MAJOR PIERCE
The warning from the future?
HAMMOND
That's the theory, Major. We don't know the circumstances in which
it was written, only that the signature and the blood found on the
note match Colonel O'Neill's. We just determined that the race of
people we're currently in trade negotiations with, the Aschen, may
be from one of these four planets.
PIERCE
And the only way to rule out 970 as the Aschen world, is to check
out the other three, Sir?
HAMMOND
That's your mission. Have your teams ready to embark once the MALPs
have determined you're good to go.
INT--ASCHEN HARVESTER SHIP
O'NEILL
Just out of curiosity--what kind of defence technologies are we
talking about? Space guns? Force fields? Motherships?
MOLLEM
This is an example of a bio-weapon we can make available to you.
[A purple bubble rises from an opening in the table.]
MOLLEM
A living, radioactive, genetic material that may be designed to
attack and destroy only the specific DNA of your enemy.
[He turns off the device.]
MOLLEM
We have a number of efficient delivery systems.
JOE
Well, we'd want certain assurances...
MOLLEM
That we'd take military action only against your enemies and not
your friends. Of course. The question arises--why have these friends
of Earth not yet provided you with the defence technologies that you
seek from us?
CARTER
Most of the advanced races that we have befriended have hesitated to
share their technology with us for fear that we will use it to
destroy ourselves.
MOLLEM
True friends would endeavour to prevent that. You have changed the
way in which we view the universe. Do not underestimate what we
offer in return for that gift. We can put an end to disease, double
the human lifespan, provide the means to cross entire continents in
a single step, much more than simply a means to defend yourselves
against your enemies. We offer Earth membership within the Aschen
Confederation.

HAMMOND
May I ask why?
(Pause)
Understood.
[He hangs up the phone and speaks to Davis.]
HAMMOND
Sergeant, abort the dialling sequence.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir. Aborting dialling sequence.
HAMMOND
SG-15, your recon mission has been scrubbed till further notice. You
may stand down.
DAVIS
Sir? What's going on?
HAMMOND
That's what I aim to find out.
INT--THE ABANDONED CITY UNDER THE VOLIAN PLANET
[Daniel and Teal'c are running through the building. Rocks are falling
around them.]
TEAL'C
It would not be wise to attempt that again, Daniel Jackson.
[Daniel is holding a number of cardboard tubes. He takes some papers
out of one of the cylinders and spreads them out on a slab of stone.]
DANIEL
Okay, now, if I'm right, these are newspapers.
TEAL'C
It seems to be faint pictures.
DANIEL
Yes, and hopefully they'll paint a thousand words. The language
seems to be similar to an ancient Celtic text I found in Wales. I
should be able to make some of this out. We need to go through all
of this. We're looking for the big headlines first.
TEAL'C
This cavern may be unstable. I believe it would be best if we
returned to the surface.
DANIEL
I don't think so. If this doesn't serve our purposes, we're going to
have to take another look around. If the Aschen really do have
something to hide, I don't think we're going to get a second chance.
INT--THE ASCHEN HARVESTER SHIP
MOLLEM
Colonel, you seem pensive.
O'NEILL
No, I was just thinking. You're offering a lot more than we asked
for.
MOLLEM
Our motives are not entirely selfless. Perhaps you offer more than
you give yourself credit for.
CARTER
Access to the Stargate network?
MOLLEM
And the promise of much more, Major Carter. An introduction to the
advanced races that you have befriended just as the Volians
introduced you to us. Your ways and culture will enrich ours. The
Aschen are not the natural explorers that you so obviously are.
Fortified by our technology, you can continue your exploration,
share with us what you've learned.
JOE
You understand, I have to present your offer to our leaders?
MOLLEM
You'll find we are a very patient people, Ambassador. In the
meantime, I will also confer with my leadership, and recommend to
them the immediate commencement of trade between our worlds.
[They all rise.]
MOLLEM
I look forward to our future together.
JOE
As do I.
O'NEILL
Well, that was--easy.
JOE
This was just the first stage. If you thought it was too easy,
believe me, you won't feel that way when we're done.
O'NEILL
So I'm the only one that has a bad feeling about this?
JOE
Yes.
[Joe exits.]
O'NEILL
Just checking.
INT--THE ABANDONED CITY UNDER THE VOLIAN PLANET
DANIEL
Here's something. The headline says something about pandemic, some
sort of--I can't translate that--maybe fever. Now, assuming the
Aschen are the newcomers in this article, they provided a--can't
translate that word either--but it appears to have been some sort of
vaccine. And the Volian people were immensely grateful.
TEAL'C
Which serves to prove the Aschen people are honourable?
DANIEL
Actually, all it proves is that the city was abandoned sometime
after they made contact with the Aschen. Cities are usually
abandoned when civilizations fall.
TEAL'C
Perhaps they relocated elsewhere within the Aschen Confederation.
DANIEL
I don't much like the sound of that either. Keel said he'd never
been anywhere else.
TEAL'C
This city has been abandoned for many years.
DANIEL
Yes, but long enough ago for Keel to have absolutely no idea it was
ever here?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
HAMMOND
Welcome back. As per your instructions, Ambassador, an Air Force Jet
is standing by at Peterson to take you back to Washington just as
soon as you're cleared by our doctors.
JOE
Thank you, General.
(To O'Neill and Carter)
History will remember your contribution to this.
O'NEILL
O'Neill
[He holds up two fingers.]
O'NEILL
Two Ls.
JOE
And Major, next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I know a restaurant
that beats your Mess hands down.
CARTER
I'd like that.
O'NEILL
Well, General, it might be time to reconsider this retirement thing.
HAMMOND
Not yet, Colonel. Come with me.
[They walk to the Star Map, where P4C-970 is indicated.]
HAMMOND
The President doesn't want to risk such a potentially rewarding
alliance on the basis of a note that may or may not have been a
warning from the future.
O'NEILL
I knew that thing was gonna come back to haunt me.
CARTER
General, to confirm the Aschen are from a world other than 970 is
only prudent.
HAMMOND
And if we encounter the Aschen on one of those other worlds?
CARTER
They wouldn't be too happy about it.
HAMMOND
It could jeopardise the treaty.
O'NEILL
Send a probe.
HAMMOND
For all we know, sending a probe was what caused the problem you
were trying to avoid by sending your note.
O'NEILL
Well, technically, I haven't sent it yet. But if I get a chance
again, I'm sure gonna fill it with a lot more detail.
CARTER
Well, you were probably trying to limit the causality violation by
keeping it simple.
O'NEILL
(To Carter)
I wonder whose idea that was?
(To Hammond)
Sir, you know me. I wouldn't have sent the note without a damn good
reason. The President should know that.
HAMMOND
He's under a lot of pressure to present a concrete benefit of the
Stargate program before the next election.
O'NEILL
Oh, here we go.
HAMMOND
The bottom line is, he wants us out of it. From now on, this treaty
is a State matter.
CARTER
Well, what did Daniel and Teal'c find out?
HAMMOND
They haven't returned yet.
INT--THE ABANDONED CITY UNDER THE VOLIAN PLANET
DANIEL
The Aschen vaccine had a side effect. I don't know what. It might be
an Aschen word, but I know it was big news around here.
TEAL'C
How would you know this Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
Well, it's in big, black letters "Aschen vaccine causes--something".
I don't know what it is, but I don't think it's a good thing.
TEAL'C
These pictures appear to be much like those we saw of people
celebrating.
DANIEL
Ah, I don't think they're celebrating. I think they're rioting.
O'NEILL
(Over radio)
Daniel? Teal'c?
DANIEL
(Into radio)
We're in an underground cavern. The Aschen know we're down here?
EXT--A FIELD ON THE VOLIAN PLANET
O'NEILL
Negative. Keel said you were digging a hole around here?
DANIEL
(In underground cavern)
Yeah. Um, stay put. We'll come meet you.
[O'Neill and Carter come across the entrance to the underground
cavern.]
O'NEILL
Boy, when they dig a hole...
CARTER
(Into radio)
Daniel, where exactly are you?
DANIEL
(In the cavern)
We're in the buried ruins of the Volian Union's capital city. By all
accounts, a thriving metropolis, that is, I think, until the Aschen
wiped them out.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
DANIEL
Okay, here's what we know. Around two hundred years ago, the Volians
were a thriving urban civilisation approximating turn of the century
north America in terms of technology.
CARTER
That wasn't very long ago.
DANIEL
No, it wasn't.
HAMMOND
What happened to them?
DANIEL
Well, all we know is that there was a 'flu pandemic similar to the
one on Earth in 1918, that killed over twenty million people. Now,
that is when the Aschen came.
O'NEILL
Through the Stargate?
DANIEL
Actually in ships. You see the Volian Gate wasn't discovered until
years later. They befriended the Volians, offered them a vaccine for
their epidemic, and saved their world. Now, by all accounts, the
Aschen were heroes to the Volians, and their friendship lasted for
years. But, then, something happened.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
I don't know.
TEAL'C
We found no evidence of a battle.
DANIEL
I found one clue--here.
[Daniel indicates a newspaper cutting shown on the projector.]
DANIEL
Um--this word loosely translates as medicine, vaccine, drug,
followed by "from the newcomers" followed by "causes", followed
by--some word I can't translate. Now, this was the latest issue of
the paper we could find, which most likely indicates the paper shut
down or was shut down the very next day.
CARTER
Vaccine causes--what?
DANIEL
I don't know. But it caused something. Because in the span of two
hundred years, the Volians went from an urban civilisation of
millions to an agrarian civilisation of thousands after they were
saved by the Aschen.
CARTER
General, you have to speak to the President.
HAMMOND
I just tried. He's being briefed by the Ambassador, and won't take
my calls.
O'NEILL
General, I never did cash in on that open invitation to visit the
White House. Remember? Last time we saved the world?
EXT--A STRETCH LIMOUSINE IS DRIVING TOWARDS THE CAPITOL BUILDING IN
WASHINGTON DC.
O'NEILL
(In the back seat of the limo)
Driver? Pennsylvania Avenue is that way.
[O'Neill points behind him.]
DRIVER
We're picking up another passenger, Sir.
[The car stops, and the door opens. Senator Kinsey gets in the car.]
KINSEY
Colonel Starsky--or is it Hutch? I can never remember which one you
are.
O'NEILL
Kinsey, what the hell are you doing here?
KINSEY
I know this is a little more upscale than you're used to, but I
wanted a comfortable place to talk.
[He pours a drink from the bar in the back of the limo.]
KINSEY
Uh--drink?
O'NEILL
I have an appointment.
KINSEY
No, you don't. You should have heard the President when he heard you
were coming to change his mind. Man, oh, man, he can be cruel.
O'NEILL
The treaty's a mistake.
KINSEY
You were the one who recommended it in the first place.
O'NEILL
I was wrong!
KINSEY
Hell, this was worth it just to hear that. Let me tell you what it
comes down to, Colonel. Those of us who actually have been voted
into office would like the opportunity to make the damn decisions
about the governments we make treaties with.
O'NEILL
You don't have all the information.
KINSEY
I know all about the note.
O'NEILL
Which is why you should take it seriously.
KINSEY
We've got these experts who know these things. And they tell me that
the ink on your note was a new, biodegradable something or other
that hasn't quite been invented yet.
O'NEILL
What's your point?
KINSEY
What's the future really like, Colonel? You can tell me.
O'NEILL
As far as I know, it hasn't happened yet.
KINSEY
But it has for you. Hell, you've been back in time, forward in
time--you've seen it all. I just wonder how things turn out. You
know, without you being a hero anymore.
O'NEILL
This has nothing to do with me.
KINSEY
And I wonder how far you'd go to stop me from becoming President of
the United States.
O'NEILL
You think this is about you? Oh, of all the self-centered,
egotistical...
KINSEY
Egotistical? You're the one who can't stop playing God with our
future. The minute we try to make a deal for alien technology, you
decide that they're the wrong kind of aliens. Even our current
President has begun to see the pattern, and boy, he used to love
you. Rest assured, we know all about the seventy percent
probabilities, the one in four chances...
O'NEILL
Kinsey, you're in way over your head.
KINSEY
Am I? This is really a political matter, Colonel, which will require
bilateral approval, and that's why the President put me in charge of
the next stage of negotiations.
(Into car intercom)
Driver, stop at the Athletic Club, please.
(To O'Neill)
Oh, you'll get your invitation to the White House soon enough,
Colonel--just not tonight.
(To driver)
Uh, Jonathan, when we get to the Athletic Club, I'll step out. You
go on and take our guest back to Andrews.
[Kinsey salutes O'Neill with his glass before taking a drink.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
HAMMOND
Apparently, we have agreed to make a token gesture of our good
faith. Ambassador Faxon will deliver it personally, and return with
an Aschen Delegation to meet Senator Kinsey.
CARTER
We're actually going ahead with this?
HAMMOND
I'm told we're proceeding with caution.
DANIEL
What are we offering?
HAMMOND
A number of Gate coordinates.
O'NEILL
There goes the neighbourhood.
HAMMOND
Ambassador Faxon has asked that Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter
accompany him again.
O'NEILL
I thought we were out of it?
HAMMOND
Apparently, he insisted. Senator Kinsey's agreed, but only to Major
Carter, which presents us with a window of opportunity.
CARTER
What can I do?
HAMMOND
Force their hand somehow.
TEAL'C
If we accuse them directly, they may simply lie.
[Daniel has been copying something from the Volian newspaper into a
notebook.]
DANIEL
We don't have to. I have an idea.
[He hands the sheet of paper from the notebook to Carter.]
HAMMOND
Major, I can't order you to do this.
CARTER
I know, Sir. When do we leave?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is dialling out. Kinsey is standing behind Sergeant
Davis.]
DAVIS
Chevron 1 encoded.
KINSEY
Historic day, General.
HAMMOND
Let's hope so, Senator.
KINSEY
Actually, I was referring to your retirement.
[Kinsey exits.]
DAVIS
Chevron 2 encoded.
[Joe enters the Gate room, joining Carter.]
CARTER
Ambassador.
JOE
Major? Is that what you're wearing?
[She looks up at Hammond, who nods to her to proceed. She addresses Joe
in a low voice.]
CARTER
Sir, I have a lot to tell you and not a lot of time to tell it, so
please, listen carefully.
JOE
All right.
EXT--THE VOLIAN PLANET.
[The harvester is hovering above the planet. Joe and Carter are
transported on board.]
JOE
Mollem, Borren...
MOLLEM
Ambassador, Major Carter...
BORREN
Colonel O'Neill has not accompanied you?
JOE
His duties require him elsewhere.
BORREN
Of course.
JOE
It is my pleasure to offer a gesture of our own--coordinates and
Stargate symbols to several new worlds.
MOLLEM
It is our honour to receive such a gift.
[Joe bows. Borren looks at the laptop, confused. Mollem is turning the
laptop over in his hands.]
[Carter takes the laptop and puts it on a table.]
CARTER
The coordinates are on the hard drive in the laptop. It'll just take
a moment to display.
[Carter opens it, and boots it up. Mollem watches the screen as it
loads.]
JOE
Our leaders would also like to extend an invitation to Earth to
formalise our treaty.
MOLLEM
All in time.
[Coordinates are scrolling down the screen of the laptop.]
CARTER
By the way, Borren, would you read this aloud for me?
[She takes out the piece of paper and hands it to Borren.]
CARTER
I couldn't quite translate it.
BORREN
Of course--"Sterility".
CARTER
We knew what you were planning, Mollem, this just confirms it.
BORREN
What are you talking about?
CARTER
Vaccine causes sterility--that was the headline. You wiped out most
of the Volian population, and turned their entire world into
farmland. You'll do the same to Earth.
MOLLEM
Lock them in here, we have a treaty to conclude.
CARTER
If we don't come back alive, the treaty is off.
MOLLEM
That will be your loss. We have what we wanted.
[Mollem and Borren exit.]
CARTER
(To Joe)
I'm sorry.
JOE
What do you think they'll do?
CARTER
I don't know.
JOE
O'Neill sent the note to prevent this from happening. We were so
sure.
CARTER
Listen.
[The sound of the Stargate opening is heard.]
CARTER
They're dialling the Stargate.
[They go out onto the balcony. The harvester is over the Stargate.]
CARTER
They're dialling Earth.
[There is a loud noise.]
JOE
What is that?
CARTER
I don't know. But we've got to find out.
[Carter removes her backpack with Joe's help. She takes out a rope and
ties it to the railing.]
CARTER
When I get to the bottom follow me down. We'll only have a few
seconds over the Gate.
JOE
What?
[Carter climbs over the railing.]
CARTER
Just do what I tell you, when I tell you. Trust me.
JOE
Okay.
[Carter starts to lower herself on the rope, as Joe watches from above.
Joe turns round when he hears a noise behind him, to see that Borren
has entered the room.]
BORREN
Where's Major Carter?
[Below the harvester, the Gate opens. Joe runs towards Borren and
tackles him, as Carter sends the GDO signal.]
CARTER
Ambassador--now!
[Carter looks up towards the railing and sees that the biological
weapon is being lowered over the Gate.]
JOE
Go!
[As Joe is pulled back by Borren, Carter cuts the rope, and she falls
through the open wormhole.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Carter flies through the Gate onto the ramp, ending up on the steps.]
CARTER
Close the iris!
[The iris closes. There is a thud. A medic runs up to Carter as Kinsey
enters.]
KINSEY
(To O'Neill)
What in God's name is going on here?
CARTER
(Still lying on the ramp)
When they knew we were on to them, they launched a bio-weapon.
KINSEY
(To O'Neill)
Colonel!
CARTER
I had to warn you, I couldn't wait for the ambassador. I'm sorry,
Sir.
KINSEY
Colonel--I asked you a question.
O'NEILL
(To Carter)
You did good, Major.
CARTER
Thank you, Sir.
HAMMOND
Let's get her to the infirmary now.
KINSEY
Colonel. I swear, O'Neill. There's gonna be an investigation into
this.
[He leaves.]
O'NEILL
That'd be fine. O'Neill--Two Ls
[He holds up three fingers.]
DANIEL
I guess we dodged the bullet there?
TEAL'C
Senator Kinsey seems most displeased.
O'NEILL
Yeah, that's a crying shame, isn't it?
DANIEL
I just hope we don't regret giving them those Gate addresses.
O'NEILL
I don't think we will, the first one being a black hole and all.
They get progressively darker from there.
(To Carter, being tended to on the ramp)
Carter? You all right?
[Carter nods.]
