   INT--PLACE OF OUR LEGACY CHAMBER

   [The head-grabbing device entry widens.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa.

   [O'Neill tries to back away, but the device grabs his head. A bright
   light shines.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond, Fraiser, Teal'c and others watch in wonder as O'Neill types
   at a terminal.]

     HAMMOND
     What are you doing?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know, sir.

   [Later, several Stargate locations show on a screen. Carter now sits at
   the station.]

     CARTER
     The colonel must have input new Stargate locations into the
     computer.

   EXCERPT FROM 9.15 "STRONGHOLD"

   INT--BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Teal'c is restrained. Ba'al stands nearby.]

     BA'AL

     (in Goa'uld echo)
     Jaffa number in the millions spread across the vastness of the
     galaxy...what you need right now is a strong leader.

     TEAL'C

     (with scorn)
     You?

   EXCERPTS FROM 9.16 "OFF THE GRID"

   EXT--STARGATE, P6G-452, DAY

   [While Daniel attempts to dial the DHD, both the Stargate and DHD
   disappear as if beamed away by Asgard beaming technology. Daniel
   stares, mouth agape.]

     DANIEL
     Guys?!?...We've got a problem!

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1, studying reports, and Emerson sit around the table.]

     MITCHELL
     Ba'al's been busy.

     EMERSON
     He's been gathering up Stargates from all over the sector for the
     last several weeks.

   EXCERPT FROM 10.02 "MORPHEUS"

   INT--VAGONBREI ARCHIVES

   [Teal'c and Daniel sit at a table.]

     DANIEL
     In Arthurian myth, Morgan was a powerful sorceress, King Arthur's
     half-sister and an adversary of Merlin.

     TEAL'C
     That would suggest she may have had a hand in the disappearance of
     the weapon we seek.

   EXCERPTS FROM 10.03 "THE PEGASUS PROJECT"

   INT--ATLANTIS DATABASE ROOM

   [Daniel and Vala use the database.]

     DANIEL
     We're looking for the names of two planets, known on Earth in
     ancient times in the dialect of Old English as Castiana and Sahal.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Taoth Vaclarush, and Valos Cor.

   [Later]

     DANIEL
     You're not really a hologram, are you?

     MORGAN LE FAY

     (looking directly at Daniel)
     You have your answer, Daniel Jackson. I suggest you act on it.

   EXT--SPACE

   [An Al'kesh approaches Earth.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry, Vala, and SG-1, sans Daniel, sit around the table. Vala is
   turned away from the others, looking bored.]

     LANDRY
     What's the latest from the search parties?

     MITCHELL
     Nothing much to report, sir.

     CARTER
     The toxic atmosphere on Castiana is slowing us down considerably.
     Now we found evidence of stone structures on Sahal, but they appear
     to have been abandoned over 40,000 years ago.

     LANDRY
     So basically, we've got nothing.

     MITCHELL
     Not yet.

     LANDRY
     You went all the way to the Pegasus galaxy, you had a face-to-face
     encounter with a full-blown Ascended Being, came away with not one,
     but two gate addresses, and they both turn out to be dead ends?

     CARTER
     Well, see, that's the part that doesn't make any sense, sir. If
     Morgan didn't want us to find Merlin's weapon, then why tell us
     anything at all? We must be missing something.

     LANDRY
     That's what Dr. Jackson keeps telling me.

   [Vala spins around with sudden interest.]

     VALA
     You heard from Daniel?

   [Mitchell glowers at Vala, but Vala merely smiles at him and shrugs it
   off.]

     LANDRY
     He checked in from Camelot this morning. He's convinced that the
     answer is somewhere in Merlin's library, but he hasn't found
     anything yet.

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Sorry to interrupt, General. You're needed in the control room.

   [Landry groans and stands. He and the others leave the room.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [All of them come down the staircase from the briefing room and
   approach Harriman's station.]

     LANDRY
     What is it, Chief?

     HARRIMAN
     We just received a heads-up from NORAD, sir. An Al'kesh bomber just
     entered Earth's atmosphere about four minutes ago. Bearing indicates
     Cheyenne Mountain.

   [Carter and Mitchell exchange looks.]

     HARRIMAN

     (after listening to his earpiece)
     Two F-16s out of Peterson have been rerouted to intercept. I'm
     patching us in.

     F-16 PILOT

     (over radio)
     Repeat, you have entered a flight restricted zone and are requested
     to land immediately. Please respond.

   EXT--COLORADO SKY, DAY

   [The Al'kesh continues to descend, the two F-16s following.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     F-16 PILOT

     (over radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Bearcat One. The alien vessel is
     unresponsive. Should we engage?

     MITCHELL
     If they were friendly, they wouldn't be flying silent.

     CARTER
     Maybe their communications are down.

     LANDRY

     We can't take the chance.

     (louder)
     Bearcat One, this is General Landry. You are cleared to engage.

   EXT--COLORADO SKY, DAY

   [An F-16 launches a missile, which strikes the port engine exhausts and
   explodes. The Al'kesh falters.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Everyone waits tensely for further word.]

     F-16 PILOT

     (over radio)
     The alien vessel has been disabled. They're coming down hard.

     HARRIMAN
     I've got projected coordinates.

     MITCHELL
     We're on it, sir.

   [The team leave the control room.]

   EXT--COLORADO FIELD, DAY

   [An unmarked SUV drives along a rural road and stops. Several vehicles
   are parked nearby, including a military ambulance. The crashed Al'kesh
   sits in the field. Mitchell, Carter, Teal'c and Vala exit the SUV.
   Major Caffey greets the team.]

     CARTER
     What's the situation, Major?

     CAFFEY
     The area has been secured. No one on board except for the pilot.
     He's being treated for minor injuries.

     MITCHELL
     Let's have a look at him.

   [Caffey leads them around the ambulance vehicle. The doors are wide
   open. A medic moves from where he is treating the pilot's head injury.
   The pilot is Ba'al, still holding some gauze to his forehead.]

     BA'AL
     Ah, at last. The welcoming committee.

   [The team shares shocked and suspicious looks with each other.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter works at a station. Mitchell, Teal'c and Vala watch a monitor
   showing Ba'al pacing in an interrogation room, furnished with only a
   table and chairs.]

     MITCHELL
     I don't get it. We know that Ba'al has come to Earth before without
     being detected.

     TEAL'C
     Presumably by cloaked cargo ship or by using Asgard beaming
     technology from high orbit.

     MITCHELL
     Exactly. So why would he fly an Al'kesh directly to Stargate
     Command?

     VALA
     Maybe he was planning to attack?

     MITCHELL
     Nah, even Ba'al's not that crazy.

     VALA

     (chuckling)
     I wouldn't be so sure.

     CARTER
     Well, this is interesting. There's a signal coming from inside the
     interrogation room. He must have implanted himself with a locator
     beacon.

     VALA
     No doubt, he's expecting his people to beam him out at some point.

     MITCHELL
     Better not hold his breath.

     VALA
     Why not?

     CARTER
     Well, after the Stargate was stolen two years ago, we installed
     jamming devices to prevent anyone from locking onto a signal from
     within the base.

   [While Carter speaks, Landry enters the lab from behind her.]

     MITCHELL
     General. Has he said anything?

   [Carter stands.]

     LANDRY
     Only that he won't talk to anybody but SG-1.

     CARTER
     Lucky us.

     LANDRY
     Frankly, I'm inclined to let him rot.

     MITCHELL
     That's all right, sir. We'll...we'll talk to him. After all, he did
     come all this way.

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [The door opens, and the team enter the cell. Ba'al notes each of
   them.]

     BA'AL
     Colonel Mitchell. Colonel Carter. Teal'c. Qetesh.

   [Ba'al smugly takes a seat. Carter sits across from him.]

     CARTER
     She goes by Vala now.

     VALA
     Always did, really.

   [Vala and Carter exchange knowing looks. Teal'c pointedly stands facing
   away from Ba'al, though able to watch him peripherally. Mitchell
   crosses his arms.]

     MITCHELL
     We've been authorized to give you the time of day, so make it quick
     and make it good.

     BA'AL
     Of course. I understand your reluctance to trust me, so I'll be
     succinct. It's the clones. They want me dead.

     TEAL'C
     That would make all of us.

     MITCHELL
     Dead, huh? What'd you do? Short-sheet the bed? Cheat at cards?

     BA'AL
     You must understand that what I did was out of necessity. You were
     the ones who invited the Ori into this galaxy. I was merely trying
     to preserve a safe haven for myself and a few...good friends.

   [Vala leans forward, both hands braced against the table, studying
   Ba'al.]

     TEAL'C

     (with disdain)
     You mean slaves.

   [Ba'al shrugs.]

     MITCHELL
     So you stole a few Stargates, tried to set up your own network.
     Yadda, yadda, yadda. We were there, remember?

     BA'AL
     Luckily, I wasn't. I had to hear about your heroics thirdhand. I
     also had to hear about how you thwarted my attempts to gain control
     of the Jaffa High Council.

   [Teal'c smirks.]

     CARTER
     But none of this explains why the clones would turn on you.

     VALA
     That's probably because there's a little more to his plan than he's
     letting on.

     BA'AL
     Ah. Perceptive, as usual.

   [Ba'al nods at Vala with a hint of respect. Vala crouches down next to
   Carter who turns to her.]

     VALA

     (low to Carter)
     Didn't Daniel tell me something about a very powerful weapon in the
     hands of the Jaffa on Dakara?

     CARTER
     It's not a weapon, technically. It was a device that was originally
     used by the Ancients to seed all life in this galaxy, but we did
     adapt it to destroy the Replicators.

     BA'AL

     (leaning forward and stretching out his arms)
     Using my simultaneous dialing program, I might add.

   [Carter flashes a humorless smile and turns back to Vala.]

     VALA
     Am I correct in assuming that this device can be adapted to kill
     organic life as well?

     CARTER
     Yes.

     VALA

     (rising)
     Now it's starting to make sense.

     MITCHELL
     It is?

   [Ba'al clasps his hands and lifts them so they hide his mouth's
   expression, but his eyes sparkle with interest.]

     VALA
     Well, you must remember that I have intimate knowledge of just how
     depraved the Goa'uld can be.

     TEAL'C
     You are suggesting that Ba'al attempted to gain control of the High
     Council in order to gain access to the Ancient device.

     VALA
     With the purpose of wiping out all life in the galaxy, except his
     own little corner, of course.

   [Ba'al lowers his hands and looks at Vala with a defiant smile.]

     MITCHELL
     That was Anubis's plan.

     BA'AL

     (chuckling)
     I never said it was original. But if I had succeeded, the Ori
     would've lost interest and been on their merry way.

     CARTER
     You were going to save the galaxy by destroying pretty much everyone
     in it?

   [Ba'al shrugs in agreement.]

     MITCHELL
     But your clones figured out you weren't bring them along, didn't
     they?

     BA'AL
     They served their purpose. But what can I say? Their...egos were
     beginning to be a problem.

     MITCHELL
     Well, they are your clones.

     VALA
     What I don't understand is, after this particular revelation, you
     thought SG-1 would want to help you.

     BA'AL
     Because I can help you.

     TEAL'C

     (scornfully)
     With what?

     BA'AL
     Your search for Merlin's weapon, of course.

   [Teal'c faces Ba'al and the rest of his team looks equally interested.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Landry sits at his desk looking through papers. Harriman knocks at the
   open door, Barrett beside him.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir? Agent Barrett is here to see you.

   [Harriman motions for Barrett to enter, then departs. Barrett, carrying
   a briefcase enters.]

     LANDRY
     Barrett. What can I do for you?

   [Barrett sets his briefcase down on Landry's desk.]

     BARRETT
     I'm here for the prisoner, sir.

     LANDRY
     Excuse me?

     BARRETT
     Ba'al. I have an official request for his transfer into NID custody.

   [Barrett opens his briefcase and pulls out a piece of paper, handing it
   to Landry.]

     LANDRY
     You gotta be kidding. We caught him, we can handle it.

   [Landry sets the paper aside.]

     BARRETT
     With all due respect, sir, it's my understanding he basically flew
     himself into your front door. Look, nobody wants a jurisdictional
     tug-of-war here. We've been investigating the Goa'uld infiltration
     of the Trust for two years now. I'm telling you, it's a global
     conspiracy. Political and corporate connections in over a dozen
     countries. Your prisoner is at the top of the pyramid.

     LANDRY
     We don't even know if he's the real Ba'al.

     BARRETT
     Even if he's a clone, I betcha he's got enough information to bring
     down the whole organization. We could wipe them out.

     LANDRY
     Eh, you're just gonna have to wait your turn. Right now, we've got
     bigger fish to fry.

   INT--INTERROGATION ROOM

     BA'AL
     Anubis told me of the weapon, and of its power. He dedicated
     considerable effort to finding it during his time in our plane of
     existence, but he never succeeded.

     CARTER

     (skeptically)
     And you have the address?

     BA'AL
     Actually, you have the address. It's among those Colonel O'Neill
     obtained during his encounter with the Ancient Repository of
     Knowledge, on the planet you call P3R-272.

     TEAL'C
     There are thousands of addresses on that list.

     BA'AL
     Exactly why you'll never find it on your own. I, however, have
     information that will allow you to narrow down your choices
     considerably. All I ask in return is that you eliminate the clones.

     MITCHELL
     And we do that exactly how?

     BA'AL
     It should be easy enough to track them down. I implanted a locator
     chip in each one when I created them.

     CARTER
     That's funny, because we detected a locator chip in you.

     BA'AL
     I had to implant one in myself in order to gain their trust.

     CARTER
     Ah.

     BA'AL
     You can use the tracking system on board my Al'kesh. They'll never
     see it coming.

     MITCHELL
     Well, that is a truly incredible story, in every sense of the word.

     BA'AL
     I should also mention that every one of my clones knows about
     Merlin's weapon, and if any one of them, at any point, were captured
     by the Priors, and were it to somehow...slip out...that the SGC
     computer contains the location of the weapon deadly to the Ori...

     TEAL'C

     (interrupting)
     The Priors would stop at nothing to have it within their grasp.

     BA'AL
     It is of course, your decision. I leave it in your very "capable"
     hands.

   [Teal'c storms out, Vala, Carter, and Mitchell follow.]

   INT--INTERROGATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Landry and Barrett watch SG-1 leave the room.]

     BARRETT
     You can't seriously think that he's telling the truth.

     LANDRY
     The whole truth? Of course not. But there's too much at stake here
     not to investigate.

     BARRETT
     And in the meantime, what am I supposed to tell my superiors?

     LANDRY
     That's your problem.

   [Landry turns away and leaves, smiling to himself.]

   INT--SGC-BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry, SG-1 and Vala sit around the table. Lee paces the room
   delivering a briefing.]

     LEE
     We, uh, managed to activate the tracking system on the Al'kesh, and
     this is what we got.

   [Lee clicks a button on the remote in his hand and the screen shows
   dots indicating several different planet locations.]

     MITCHELL
     Those are the Ba'als?

     LEE

     (grinning)
     More like "dots" really.

   [Landry and Teal'c each look unamused.]

     LEE
     Get it? "Dots", "balls"?

   [No one shares his amusement. Lee clears his throat and becomes serious
   again.]

     LEE
     A-Any-anyway, we've worked up those files with the, uh, current
     locations showing the addresses and any available intel.

     MITCHELL

     (leaning across to Carter)
     All right, so what kind of trap are we looking at?

     CARTER
     I don't think it would be as simple as an ambush. Not while we have
     him in custody. No Goa'uld would sacrifice himself like that.

     MITCHELL

     (turning to Landry)
     What do you think, sir?

   [Vala leans closer to Mitchell and rests her hand on the headrest of
   his chair.]

     VALA

     (to Mitchell)
     I say we give it a go.

     LANDRY
     Remind me to give you a primer on the meaning of the word "sir". But
     she's right. We won't know if Ba'al is serious or not until we test
     out some of these addresses.

   [Carter looks down at the paper in front of her.]

     CARTER
     Some of this intel seems pretty sketchy.

   [Vala looks at Mitchell's copy of the report and points to part of the
   page.]

     VALA
     I'm familiar with this planet. It used to belong to Camulus.

     MITCHELL
     Can you get us in?

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Absolutely.

   [Mitchell and Carter exchange a look.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Landry and Mitchell step out of an elevator and start walking down the
   corridor.]

     LANDRY
     You sure you want to bring her along on this one?

     MITCHELL
     Jackson says she'll be useful. Now's her chance to prove it.

     LANDRY
     But Dr. Jackson isn't here, and it seems to me, he's the only one
     she ever listens to.

     MITCHELL

     (hesitantly)
     Yeah...some of the time.

     LANDRY
     You don't think you can control her?

     MITCHELL
     Oh, I know I can't control her. But that's pretty much par for the
     course. Sir...Carter and I are the same rank. Teal'c's an alien.
     Jackson's a civilian. I learned a long time ago, I don't "control"
     anything.

     LANDRY
     Who does?

   INT--SGC ARMORY

   [An airman hands Teal'c a P-90, which he receives with a nod. The
   airman then hands Mitchell his P-90. The two finish checking their
   gear.]

   [Vala jogs into the armory, showing off her field BDUs and vest with
   excited flair. Carter follows at a more sedate pace.]

     VALA
     How do I look?

   [Mitchell glances up briefly. Teal'c barely notice her, adjusting his
   weapon's belt.]

     MITCHELL
     Turn around.

   [Mitchell checks something on the back of her vest, then nods, turning
   back to his own preparations.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, you look great.

   [Vala spins back around with a content smile.]

     VALA

     (to Teal'c)
     A little more enthusiasm from you next time.

   [The airman passes over a P-90. Vala takes it.]

     VALA
     Thank you.

   [Mitchell immediately plucks it away and hands it over to Carter.]

     VALA
     What?

     MITCHELL
     Zat.

   [Carter follows Teal'c quickly away from Mitchell and Vala.]

     VALA

     (incredulous)
     This is my first real mission through the gate, and I'm the only one
     who knows the terrain.

     MITCHELL
     Try not to get us killed.

   [Mitchell walks away. The airman hands Vala a zat which she accepts
   with a grimace.]

   EXT--UNNAMED PLANET, DAY

   [A ha'tak sits on the planet. Some distance away, SG-1 and Vala stand
   in a small clearing.]

     VALA
     Here we are!

   [Vala kicks aside some brush with her foot, revealing a ring platform.]

     MITCHELL
     And what?

     VALA
     Well, it's a ring platform. Somewhat hidden, but it's a back door,
     if you will.

     CARTER
     Okay, but it doesn't do us much good if we can't activate it.

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Leave that to me.

   [She skips off into the trees.]

     MITCHELL
     Hang on!

   [Vala jogs out of sight.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Carter and Teal'c)
     Where's she going?

   [Carter shrugs and shakes her head.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Three Jaffa patrol the woods. Vala hides behind a large tree stump.
   Once they have passed, she casually moves around to the front of the
   stump and leans against it, zat in one hand. With her other, she puts
   two fingers to her mouth and whistles. The Jaffa spin around. She hits
   the first Jaffa with a zat blast then dives away before the others can
   aim properly. She runs through the woods dodging staff weapon blasts.]

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [SG-1 hear weapons fire and crouch by cover, weapons ready. Vala jogs
   back out of the woods, a wide grin on her face.]

     MITCHELL
     What the hell are you doing?

     VALA
     I alerted a Jaffa patrol to our presence.

   [She stops in the middle of the platform, catching her breath.]

     MITCHELL
     Obviously. Do you mind if I ask why?

     VALA
     So they'd sound the alarm and send reinforcements.

     MITCHELL

     (sarcastic)
     Oh, well that's...that's brilliant! Hey, how come I didn't think of
     that?

     VALA
     My dear Colonel, where do you think the reinforcements will come
     from?

   [Teal'c and Carter exchange looks. Vala glances at them, then looks at
   Mitchell with a grin and raised eyebrow as the other two scramble to
   stand beside her in the rings. After a glance to ensure no Jaffa are
   nearby, Mitchell joins them. Moments later, the rings activate. The
   four disappear, and four Jaffa appear in their place, moving off into
   the forest.]

   INT--HA'TAK

   [Four Jaffa march through the corridor. Mitchell, Carter, Vala, and
   Teal'c stay out of sight. Mitchell gives the all clear for them to move
   out two-by-two. Vala and Teal'c start out.]

     VALA

     (as she passes)
     You can thank me later, by the way.

   [Mitchell and Carter exchange irritated looks before following.]

   [The team moves down a corridor, pausing on either side of a doorway.
   Mitchell pulls out a smoke grenade, allowing Vala to pull the pin.]

   INT--HA'TAK THRONE ROOM/PEL'TAK

   [Several Jaffa stand guard around Ba'al Two, who sits on the throne.
   The grenade canister rolls to a stop by one Jaffa's foot. Ba'al Two
   notices it and stands up, alarmed.]

     BA'AL TWO
     Jaffa!

   [The canister explodes, causing a flash and smoke to encompass the
   chamber. The team enters, Carter and Vala firing zats.]

   [Ba'al Two reaches for a fallen staff weapon, but Teal'c steps on it,
   aiming his P-90 at the Goa'uld.]

     BA'AL TWO
     Don't shoot! I know why you're here, and you're making a big
     mistake.

   [He rises. Aside from Teal'c, Vala and Carter have their weapons aimed
   at him. Mitchell guards their rear.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, let us guess. You're the real Ba'al.

     BA'AL TWO
     Precisely.

   [The team exchange knowing looks.]

     BA'AL TWO
     No doubt the impostor promised you the location of Merlin's weapon
     if you helped him get rid of the rest of us.

     CARTER
     That's right.

     BA'AL TWO
     You do realize he has no idea where it is, or how to find it.

     VALA
     But you do.

   [Mitchell signals Vala to cover their line of retreat while he turns
   his attention to Ba'al. He unclips his P-90 and hands it to Carter.]

     BA'AL TWO
     Of course. I obtained the information only after the clones were
     created. And, needless to say, I never "shared" it with them.

   [Mitchell approaches, pulling out plastic restraints.]

     MITCHELL
     You know what? This is giving me a headache. What do you say, we
     finish this off at home? Let's go, Spartacus.

   [Mitchell ties Ba'al Two's hands behind his back and drags him off,
   Vala leading, the others following.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Both Ba'als are standing, talking to each other in the interrogation
   room. Both wear grey overalls, one labeled "one" and one labeled "two".
   The team and Landry observe the pair through the video monitor and the
   window.]

     MITCHELL

     (dryly)
     Oh yeah, now I can see the difference.

     TEAL'C
     I still cannot.

     VALA
     Do we really believe only one of them knows how to find the weapon?

     LANDRY
     This is Ba'al we're talking about. I don't think we can take
     anything either of them say at face value.

     CARTER
     So, what now, sir?

     LANDRY
     We've got scientists working here, don't we? Get 'em on this. See if
     they can sort out who's who.

   [Below them, the two Ba'als start to physically fight. SFs enter and
   zat the pair.]

     LANDRY

     (dryly)
     In the meantime, I think I'm going to have to arrange for separate
     accommodations.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT

   INT--SGC LAB

   [A geneticist and Carter review data on a computer screen.]

     GENETICIST
     I wish I had better news.

     CARTER
     So you're saying there's no way to tell them apart?

     GENETICIST
     We generated distinct DNA profiles of all four samples using a
     number of analysis techniques.

     CARTER
     Sorry? Four?

     GENETICIST
     We did the host and the Goa'uld separately.

     CARTER
     Right.

     GENETICIST
     We ran each test five times, and each case the results were uncanny.
     It was a perfect match across all thirteen specific DNA markers. I'm
     sorry, Colonel. Either the clones are genetically indistinguishable
     from the real Ba'al...

     CARTER
     ...Or we have two clones on our hands, and the real Ba'al is still
     out there.

   [The geneticist nods.]

     CARTER
     I see. Thank you.

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--ANOTHER UNNAMED PLANET FOREST, DAY

   [The team is in a firefight with several Jaffa.]

     MITCHELL
     So much for not encountering resistance.

     VALA
     I guess some Ba'als are bigger than others.

     MITCHELL
     If he's got a ship back there, we're screwed. We've got to find
     another way around.

     CARTER
     You hold this position. I'll go.

   [Carter stands and goes behind the others.]

     VALA
     I'll come with you.

   [She follows.]

     MITCHELL
     Draw some fire.

   [Mitchell begins shooting again.]

   [Vala and Carter run through the forest. Mitchell and Teal'c's weapons'
   fire are still audible in the distance. The two women stop and look at
   an open area.]

     CARTER

     (with knowing smile)
     Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

   [Vala nods and steps forward, picking up a rock and throwing it into
   the open area. It hits a force field. Vala smiles back at Carter.]

     CARTER
     Someone's coming.

   [Carter and Vala take cover. A Ba'al, wearing a long, earth-toned
   tunic, walks with several Jaffa guard.]

   [Further in the forest, Mitchell and Teal'c fire at two last Jaffa.
   When no fire is returned, Mitchell moves forward to investigate. Over a
   small ridge, they see a wounded Ba'al wearing a black and gold outfit,
   lying amongst several dead Jaffa.]

     BLACK AND GOLD BA'AL
     Don't shoot. I am the real Ba'al.

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Sam, we got Ba'al.

   [In the clearing, Carter stands calmly.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Copy that. So do we.

   [She turns and looks to where Vala is covering the earth-toned style
   Ba'al with her zat.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Harriman waits at the bottom of the active Stargate with a clipboard
   in his hand. Mitchell and Carter walk through the gate first. Following
   are the two restrained Ba'als. Teal'c and Vala follow behind them.]

     MITCHELL
     Chief, we've got a full count. Two strikes, three Ba'als.

     HARRIMAN

     (laughing)
     Oh. That's clever, sir.

     CARTER

     (rolling her eyes in amusement)
     He was thinking that one up the whole way home.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, the whole three seconds.

     CARTER
     3.2.

     MITCHELL

     (shrugging)
     Good point.

   [Behind them, guards escort the two prisoners out of the gate room,
   Vala and Teal'c follow.]

     HARRIMAN
     Well, that ties you with SG-12, because they brought in two more
     about an hour ago.

     MITCHELL
     Damn.

   [Carter shakes her head and walks away.]

     CARTER
     It's not a competition.

     MITCHELL
     Says you.

   [He follows, Harriman pausing before also leaving.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 3

   [Landry walks down a hall. Barrett approaches from another corridor.]

     BARRETT
     General!

   [Landry stops by the elevator.]

     GENERAL
     Barrett. I was wondering when you'd be back.

     BARRETT

     (agitated)
     I understand you've got yourself a few extra Ba'als. I don't suppose
     you'd consider letting me take a few off your hands.

     LANDRY
     You know I can't do that. Not until we figure out which one's the
     original, and whether or not he's bluffing about Merlin's weapon.

   [The elevator door opens and both Landry and Barrett step inside. The
   doors close.]

     LANDRY
     Besides, if any of them got wind that we had another agenda, it
     would give them leverage in the interrogation. The last thing we
     need is for them to think they have a strong bargaining position.

     BARRETT
     I was afraid you were going to say that.

     LANDRY
     I assume you spoke to your superiors.

     BARRETT
     I did. They're not happy.

     LANDRY
     The fact is, while the NID does provide civilian oversight of my
     command, I don't technically have to follow their orders...at least
     not until the President tells me to.

     BARRETT
     They tried that. For the moment, he is backing you. But if your
     investigation doesn't turn up anything useful soon, that's gonna all
     change.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 27

   [The elevator doors open, and both exit.]

     LANDRY
     Obviously.

     BARRETT
     I'd like to stay on and observe the interrogations. Any one of them
     could say something that might turn out to be useful.

     LANDRY
     Of course. You're always welcome.

   [Landry rounds the corner and enters the briefing room, where Mitchell,
   Carter, Vala and Teal'c are waiting, studying monitors filled with
   images of Ba'als. Barrett follows.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     LANDRY
     What do you got?

     CARTER
     Well, sir, SG-14 just arrived with two more Ba'al clones, which
     brings us to the end of our list.

     BARRETT
     Well, you guys got your work cut out for you, huh?

   [The team stares, overwhelmed at all the Ba'als on the surveillance
   monitors. Several of the Goa'uld staring directly into the cameras.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [A Ba'al sits across from Carter. An SF stands guard by the door.]

     BA'AL
     And just how might you be able to help me?

     CARTER
     Well, we could spare your life for one. You help us find Merlin's
     weapon, and I promise we won't kill you.

     BA'AL
     No. Instead, you'll lock me in the basement of one of your more
     appalling penal facilities--for me to live out the rest of my life
     in squalor and depravation.

     CARTER
     It's better than the alternative. Trust me.

   INT--ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Mitchell interrogates another Ba'al.]

     MITCHELL
     You see, here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking that you're not the
     real Ba'al. I mean, you're haven't even tried to cut a deal, which
     makes me think that you have no idea how to find the weapon.
     Therefore, you're just another clone.

   [Ba'al chuckles.]

     BA'AL
     I am the real Ba'al, I assure you.

     MITCHELL
     No, no, think about this. How did we meet? Do you think the real
     Ba'al would let himself be captured like that? Cowering in the
     bushes like a scared little bunny rabbit?

   [Ba'al's eyes flash with the Goa'uld glow.]

     MITCHELL
     That's better. But I'm still not buying it.

     BA'AL

     (leaning back)
     You're trying to goad me into revealing information.

     MITCHELL
     No, I'm just calling it like I see it. And right now, you don't
     strike me as someone who could intimidate a ten year old out of his
     lunch money, much less run an interstellar empire.

     BA'AL

     (with echoing voice)
     Why don't you have the guard excuse himself for a moment, and I'll
     show you just what I am "capable" of?

     MITCHELL

     (getting in his face)
     See now I know you're not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al wouldn't
     care about the guard.

   [Ba'al looks away.]

   INT--ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Ba'al One paces around a room. A tray of food sits on the table. An SF
   watches. The door opens and Vala enters. She nods to the guard a couple
   times, and with a final look at Ba'al One, he leaves.]

     VALA
     So...having a tough day, are we?

   [Vala looks up at the surveillance cameras and saunters around the
   room. Ba'al One sits on the edge of the table.]

     BA'AL ONE
     What do you want, Qetesh?

     VALA
     Is that any way to greet an old friend?

     BA'AL ONE
     Is that what we were?

     VALA
     I'll admit, we had our differences.

     BA'AL ONE
     You attacked my fleet at Selenis, crippled my flagship, and killed
     10,000 of my best Jaffa.

     VALA
     So I did. But it was nothing personal. Anyway, that's all in the
     past, and I'm here to talk about our future.

     BA'AL ONE

     (standing)
     Heh. "Our" future?

     VALA

     (slowly approaching him)
     You must admit there's always been something between us. Even when
     we wanted to kill each other, there was always certain...spark.

   [Vala gives Ba'al One a coquettish look.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Perhaps, but you've made your new allegiance clear.

     VALA

     Have I?
     (She looks up nervously at the camera and sighs.)
     Or have I just been waiting for the right opportunity?

     BA'AL ONE

     (studying her)
     What sort of opportunity?

     VALA
     You know how to find the address. I have access to the database.

     BA'AL ONE

     (glancing at the camera)
     You would betray your Tau'ri friends?

     VALA
     Friends...come and go. Besides, what use are they going to be to me
     on their knees before the armies of the Ori? You tell me what you
     know. I'll find the location of Merlin's weapon. We'll make our
     escape. And then we'll be free to share in the pleasure of each
     other's company.

     BA'AL ONE
     An excellent plan.

     VALA
     Hmm.

     BA'AL ONE
     But why wait?

   [Vala gives him a confused look. Ba'al One turns to the table.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Merlin's weapon isn't going anywhere. We have nothing but time.

   [He shoves the tray of food off the table and knocks on it. He then
   grabs Vala by the arm and spins her against it.]

     VALA

     (maintaining her smile)
     What? Here? On this rather...uncomfortable table?

   [Ba'al One caresses her cheek.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Why not?

     VALA
     Well, the security camera for starters. There's no way they'd trust
     me after seeing something like this.

   [She chuckles seductively. Both look up at the camera.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Tell them it was part of your interrogation technique.

     VALA

     (no longer smiling)
     Oh come on, be serious.

   [Vala shoves his hand away. He tries to put it back, but she strikes
   him. He grabs her by the throat.]

     BA'AL ONE

     (threatening)
     I am being serious. Aren't you?

   [He releases his grip and strokes one finger down her cheek.]

     VALA
     Hmm.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Vala and Ba'al One appear in one of the monitors. Their dialogue is
   clearly audible. Ba'al moves around the table.]

     BA'AL ONE

     (over monitor)
     Your time amongst the Tau'ri is making you soft. You used to be a
     much better liar.

   [Landry and Barrett watch the monitor. Barrett is stifling laughter.]

     LANDRY
     Don't say it.

     BARRETT
     Your people are getting nowhere, sir.

   [Landry enters his office, Barrett follows.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Landry sits at his desk.]

     LANDRY
     You think you could do better?

     BARRETT
     It's what we're trained for. I could have half a dozen agents here
     by tomorrow. I'm talking about offering our services on your
     investigation. If any of the Ba'als knows where Merlin's weapon is,
     we'll find it.

     LANDRY
     By your own admission, the NID wants this over with as quickly as
     possible, so they can move onto something they think is more
     important. Under those circumstances, I think you'll understand why
     I'd prefer to stick with my own people.

   [Barrett looks irritated.]

     BARRETT
     Yes, sir.

   [Barrett leaves.]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Carter sits at a table and takes a sips from a mug. Barrett, holding a
   mug, comes up behind her.]

     BARRETT

     (leaning over her shoulder)
     Mind if I join you?

     CARTER
     Please.

     BARRETT
     So, how are the interrogations coming?

     CARTER
     You have to ask? Look, I know you've been monitoring the
     investigation. I also know you think we're wasting our time.

     BARRETT
     No, no I never said that. Not in so many words.

   [Carter gives him a skeptical smile.]

     BARRETT
     Look, you guys are fighting the war out there, right? We're fighting
     it down here. Believe me, it's a war. Do you remember two years ago
     when the Goa'uld almost took over the Russian government? Hmm? Do
     you want to see that happen again?

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     Of course not.

     BARRETT
     Then help me.

     CARTER
     Malcolm, it's not like we're going to keep the Ba'als here forever.
     Just give us a couple of days, and then you can come in and...

     BARRETT

     (voice gradually rising)
     It's-no. This is way too important!

   [He slams his hand on the table, startling Carter and others in the
   room. He quickly composes himself.]

     CARTER
     Are you all right?

     BARRETT
     This is about us, isn't it?

     CARTER
     Wha-excuse me?

     BARRETT
     Yeah, this is about us. We obviously have unresolved issues.

     CARTER

     (forcefully)
     Look, you're my friend, and I care about you, but don't push it.

   [Barrett gets up and walks away.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [Barrett approaches the SF on duty.]

     BARRETT
     I need to see the prisoner.

   [He whips out his credentials for the guard to see.]

     BARRETT
     Now!

   [The guard glances at the badge, which Barrett flips closed. The guard
   takes his card key and swipes it. Barrett enters the room. The guard
   stands watch by the open doorway. A Ba'al is crouched inside the
   interrogation room.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell sits at one side of the table with a folder. Teal'c and Vala
   sit across from him. Teal'c has his arm on the table, hand upward. Vala
   is using both hands to try and force it down, to no effect. Teal'c
   rolls his eyes, looking bored. Landry enters the room. Mitchell
   stands.]

     MITCHELL
     General.

     LANDRY
     Somebody, give me some good news.

   [Vala stops her attempts to arm wrestle Teal'c.]

     MITCHELL
     Sorry, sir. I still don't have anything useful.

     VALA
     I didn't even make it to first base.

     LANDRY

     (looking around)
     Where's Colonel Carter?

     MITCHELL
     She was just finishing up last time I saw, but I don't think she has
     anything to report either.

     LANDRY
     We're running out of time! The NID wants the prisoners, and the
     President's not going to be able to hold them back forever.

   [Mitchell notices something on one of the monitors over Landry's
   shoulder.]

     MITCHELL
     Or they're not going to wait.

     LANDRY
     What are you talking about?

     MITCHELL
     Agent Barrett. He's talking to one of the Ba'als.

   [Landry and the others stare at the screen. Barrett and Ba'al stand
   talking.]

     LANDRY
     I didn't give authorization for that!

   [While they watch, Ba'al puts his hands up. Barrett punches him. They
   struggle and Ba'al grabs Barrett's side arm from its shoulder holster.]

     MITCHELL
     Whoa!

   [Ba'al shoots Barrett, then aims for the SF at the door.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [Carter walks down a hallway. Behind her, she hears two gunshots. She
   spins and nods to an SF on guard. Another SF stands nearby.]

     CARTER
     Radio.

   [The SF hands over his radio.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     This is Colonel Carter requesting backup, Level 16, Corridor B.

   [Carter presses the alarm button and turns to the SFs.]

     CARTER

     (to one SF)
     Come with me.
     (to other SF)
     You, cover both.

   [The SF nods as Carter and the first SF run down the hallway.]

   [In another corridor, a Ba'al swipes a keycard through the slot. It
   opens.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell and Landry watch as one Ba'al greets another and hands him a
   spare weapon. They both leave the interrogation room.]

     MITCHELL
     We're losing containment.

   [Landry reaches for the phone.]

     LANDRY

     (into phone)
     This is General Landry. I need a full security lockdown of Levels 15
     through 17, now!

   [The security monitors turn to static.]

     MITCHELL
     And there goes the feed. We're blind!

   [Mitchell, Teal'c and Vala leave the room. Landry looks on with
   concern.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR LEVEL 16 AND INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Carter and the SF cautiously approach the open interrogation room.
   Weaponless, Carter holds back and signals the SF to take lead. He does
   a quick sweep and kneels by the downed guard. Carter runs over to
   Barrett's side. Barrett grimaces in pain. She grabs his hand.]

     BARRETT
     Oh, Sam! He got away. He got my gun!

     CARTER
     It's okay. We'll get you out of here.

     BARRETT
     Okay.

   [Carter glances over to the SF. Based on his response, she shakes her
   head, closing her eyes in regret. She helps Barrett to his feet.]

   [The three walk down the corridor.]

     BA'AL FOUR
     Going somewhere?

   [They spin to find Ba'al Four with a zat trained on them. Ba'al Eight
   comes from behind him and fires twice, downing the SF and Carter.
   Barrett turns to find two more Ba'als at the end of the corridor, also
   with weapons. One Ba'al fires his zat, and Barrett too falls.]

     BA'AL

     (smirking)
     Put them with the others.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, NEAR BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Landry strides down a hallway. Mitchell, Vala, and Teal'c, all kitted
   in vests and carrying weapons, follow behind him.]

     MITCHELL
     We have emergency forces in position at all access points, sir. All
     three levels are locked down and secure.

   [Landry nods to an SF, who opens a door to the team.]

   INT--LEE'S LAB

   [The group enters Lee's lab. Lee sits by a console. Other scientists
   work nearby.]

     LANDRY
     What've you got for me, Doctor?

     LEE
     Uh, well...we're thinking our best bet is symbiote poison,
     introduced in gas form into all three levels.

   [Vala glances at Teal'c and his pouch.]

     LEE

     (continuing)
     It-it won't harm any of our people, but it will kill any of the
     Goa'uld who come in contact with it.

     LANDRY
     Excellent. Do it.

     LEE
     Well, it's-it's not that simple. You see, we'll have to use the
     ventilation system to distribute the gas, and, eh, it's not really
     designed for that sort of thing.

     LANDRY
     What are you saying?

   [Lee points to a schematic of the ventilation system.]

     LEE
     I-I can, uh, run some simulations and determine the optimum points
     to seal off the levels and to insert the gas, but even at optimum
     efficiency, it won't be distributed evenly. There-there's bound to
     be dead pockets where the gas will take longer before it has any
     effect.

     MITCHELL

     (starting to talk over him)
     All-all right, so what you're saying is, depending on location, some
     of the Ba'als may get advance warning, sir.

     VALA

     (shaking her head)
     As soon as they realize what's happening, they're going to kill the
     hostages.

     TEAL'C
     Then we must be prepared to provide a distraction at the moment the
     gas is released.

     LANDRY
     Go.

   INT--INTERROGATION CELL, LEVEL 16

   [Carter awakens to find her hands tied behind her back. Barrett lies
   next to her. She sits up and notices he and various guards are
   similarly restrained and unconscious. The door opens and Ba'al Two
   enters, carrying a rifle.]

     BA'AL TWO
     Get up. We don't have much time.

   [Carter struggles to rise. Ba'al Two helps her to her feet and leads
   her out of the room.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 3

   [Mitchell, Vala and Teal'c move through a corridor, followed by several
   military forces.]

     MITCHELL
     Remember, we can't afford to be seen until Dr. Lee gives us the
     signal.

     VALA
     Got it.

     MITCHELL
     No improvising this time. We stick to the plan.

     VALA
     Despite the fact that my improvisations have been extremely useful
     in the past?

     MITCHELL

     (pointing to access shaft)
     That's your entry point.

   [Vala opens the shaft and enters it, a few guards remaining with her.
   Mitchell and Teal'c continue on with some SFs.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [The door opens and Ba'al Two leads Carter in. Several Ba'als surround
   a computer terminal on a desk.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Bring her.

   [Ba'al Two releases her restraints and escorts her over to the
   terminal. She takes a seat by it.]

     BA'AL ONE
     The access code, please.

   [Carter looks at the display requesting an access code.]

     CARTER
     You're trying to download the list of planets from the Ancient
     database.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [A Ba'al patrols the corridor. Unnoticed, Mitchell and his team stay
   covered in a side corridor.]

   INT--ANOTHER SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c and his team head down a corridor. Teal'c hears something and
   orders them to hide in a side passage. Immediately after, Ba'al Six
   starts down the corridor, rifle at ready. He continues down as Ba'al
   Five appears behind him.]

     BA'AL FIVE
     What are you doing? We need to join the others.

     BA'AL SIX
     All right. I'm coming.

   [Ba'al Six joins Ba'al Five and they go through the door at the end of
   the hall. As soon as everything is clear, Teal'c and his team move in
   the other direction.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

     CARTER
     You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

     BA'AL ONE
     A weapon capable of destroying not only the Ori, but the Ancients as
     well. I'd say that's a pretty valuable commodity.

     CARTER
     I won't do it.

   [Ba'al One leans in.]

     BA'AL ONE
     This would be an inappropriate time for heroics, Colonel.

     CARTER
     Go ahead and kill me. It's only a matter of time before we regain
     control of this level. Good luck trying to figure out the code
     before then.

     BA'AL ONE

     I would never dream of killing you. But I will kill the other
     hostages.

     (to Ba'al Seven)
     You. start with Agent Barrett.

   [Ba'al Seven smirks and primes his weapon, heading for the door.]

     CARTER

     Wait.

     (She pauses and sighs)
     I'll do it.

   INT--VENTILATION SHAFT, LEVEL 14

   [Siler opens the grate and enters the shaft.]

     SILER

     (into radio)
     I'm in position, Doc. Level 14, Section C-9 on the ventilation grid.

   INT--LEE'S LAB

   [Landry and Lee wait in the lab, looking at the schematic.]

     LEE

     (into radio)
     All right, that's our main access point on the North side. Now, the
     first thing you'll need to do is seal off the vent before the
     junction.

   INT--VENTILATION SHAFT, LEVEL 14

     SILER

     (into radio)
     I'm on it.

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [The download is at 56%.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Why is this taking so long?

     CARTER

     (shrugging)
     It's a lot of information.

     BA'AL ONE
     You did something to slow the download, didn't you?

     CARTER
     I don't know what you're talking about.

     BA'AL ONE

     (scoffing)
     It doesn't matter. You can't stop us, anyway.

     (to other Ba'als)
     Check the perimeter. They'll be coming soon.

   [The other Ba'als leave, weapons at ready. Carter bites her lip.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [Vala and a group of SFs move stealthily down the hall. Footsteps
   approach. Vala signals, and they all take cover behind some canisters.
   Right afterwards, some Ba'als appear alert and ready.]

   INT--ANOTHER CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and his team are hiding. Mitchell uses his mirror to see
   Ba'als patrolling everywhere.]

     MITCHELL

     (low into radio)
     Teal'c, Vala, we've got a bit of a dead end here. You got Carter's
     twenty?

   INT--ANOTHER SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c and his team are also in hiding.]

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     Negative. I am similarly immobilized.

   [Around the corner, another Ba'al patrols.]

   INT--LEE'S LAB

     LANDRY
     Doctor?

     LEE
     We're setting up five separate access points. They all have to be
     ready to go simultaneously. It's just going to take a minute.

   [Landry shakes his head and continues pacing. Lee types at his
   keyboard.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [The download is complete. Carter, looking disgusted, slowly picks up
   the drive, but Ba'al One snatches it from her hands.]

     BA'AL ONE
     I'll take that.

     CARTER
     It won't do you any good. They'll never let you off this base, even
     if you kill us all.

     BA'AL ONE
     Yes, that's what I wanted you to think. Otherwise, you never
     would've given me the code.

     CARTER
     What are you talking about?

     BA'AL ONE

     (crouching down)
     I knew they wouldn't negotiate. Not even for you. Not with something
     like this at stake.

   [Ba'al One stands, puts the drive in his pocket, and pulls out a
   Beretta. Carter looks nervous.]

     BA'AL ONE
     Fortunately, that's not the plan.

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [Ba'al One exits, then uses a keycard to lock the door.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [Carter approaches the door and tries to open it, then hits and kicks
   it. She turns away in frustration.]

   INT--MITCHELL'S CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [Ba'als search every room.]

     MITCHELL
     Where the hell is that gas?

   INT--VALA'S CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

     VALA

     (whispering into radio)
     I don't mean to rush you boys, but we're about to be discovered
     here.

     BA'AL NINE
     We know you're back there.

     VALA
     So much for the plan.

   [The guards watch as she breaks cover and fires her zat, downing Ba'al
   Nine. Ba'al Sixteen and another Ba'al take cover and return fire. The
   SFs begin to shoot. One SF is downed by a P-90.]

   INT--MITCHELL'S CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

     MITCHELL

     (hearing the fire)
     Aw, hell.

   [Mitchell's team begins exchanging fire with other Ba'als. One SF is
   downed by a zat.]

   INT--LEE'S LAB

     AIRMAN

     (through radio)
     We have gunfire on Level 16.

     LANDRY

     (into radio)
     Siler, this is General Landry. Forget about a coordinated attack.
     Just hit 'em with as much gas as you can, now!

     SILER

     (via radio)
     Yes, sir.

   [Landry and Lee exchange sighs.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 14

   [Siler shoves the hose into the ventilation shaft. He then opens the
   valves on all the gas canisters. Smoke starts pouring into the shaft.]

   INT--VARIOUS CORRIDORS, LEVEL 16

   [Vala's team and Mitchell's team continue to exchange fire with various
   Ba'als. Ba'al Eight is downed by a bullet from Mitchell or one of his
   team. Other Ba'als congregate and retreat. Teal'c and Vala's teams meet
   up.]

     VALA
     We have a man down. Are you all right?

     TEAL'C
     We are uninjured.

     VALA
     And Mitchell?

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [The door to the room bursts open as Mitchell kicks it in. Carter looks
   up from by the computer to find Mitchell and his team there, weapons
   ready. Mitchell aims his weapon away from Carter.]

     MITCHELL
     Are you okay?

     CARTER
     I'm fine. What's happening?

     MITCHELL
     We've got 'em on the run. It looks like they're retreating back to
     one of the isolation rooms.

     CARTER

     (worriedly)
     Wait a minute. All of them together?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, why?

   [Carter races out of the room.]

     MITCHELL

     (calling after her)
     Sam?

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 16

   [Carter, Mitchell, and his team jog to join Teal'c and Vala's teams
   exchanging weapons fire with various Ba'als as they head into one of
   the isolation rooms.]

   [The ventilation shaft starts spewing out the symbiote poison. Two of
   the Ba'als collapse from its effects. Sam hurries to the isolation
   room.]

   INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [Carter looks in from the doorway at the room full of Ba'als.]

     CARTER
     You're too late. The symbiote poison.

     BA'AL ONE
     You're the one who's too late.

   [As Mitchell and guards round the corner, the group of Ba'als are
   beamed away.]

   INT--TEL'TAK

   [The Ba'als appear in the tel'tak. Ba'al One approaches the Jaffa at
   the controls of the cargo ship.]

     BA'AL ONE

     (with Goa'uld echo)
     Get us out of here.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The tel'tak decloaks and jumps into hyperspace.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c, Carter, Landry, Mitchell, and Vala sit around the table.]

     LANDRY
     How the hell did he do it?

     CARTER
     It looks like the locator beacons actually served a dual purpose. In
     close proximity, they combined to amplify the signal, enough to be
     picked up through our jamming screen.

     VALA
     That's why he needed us to go and round up all the clones and bring
     them here. He was playing us from the start.

     MITCHELL
     This was all so that he could get his hands on that list of planets.

     CARTER
     He must genuinely believe that Merlin's weapon is hidden on one of
     them.

     TEAL'C
     Even so, he took a great risk. It was only because Agent Barrett
     violated protocol that he was afforded the opportunity to escape the
     interrogation room.

     MITCHELL
     And that was the reason he was able to get all the clones in one
     place so they could beam out.

     CARTER
     So if the whole thing was planned in advance, how did he know what
     Agent Barrett was going to do?

   [All of them exchange looks of realization.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16

   [Barrett sits at the table, his briefcase beside him. Landry and the
   team enter.]

     LANDRY
     Agent Barrett, we need to talk.

     BARRETT
     Yes?

     CARTER
     Did you read the reports on Ba'al's attempts to take control of the
     Jaffa High Council?

     BARRETT
     Yeah, sure I did.

     TEAL'C
     The council members were influenced by some form of mind control.

     BARRETT
     Yeah, I remember, so?

     MITCHELL
     So, what were you doing in Ba'al's cell?

     BARRETT
     I went to question him.

     LANDRY
     You had no authorization for that.

     BARRETT
     You were stonewalling me. I decided to take matters into my own
     hands.

     CARTER
     You took your weapon into the interrogation room.

     BARRETT
     Yeah. Yeah, I shouldn't have done that. That was a mistake.

     CARTER
     See, the Malcolm Barrett I know would never have made that kind of
     mistake.

     MITCHELL
     Your record indicates your entire career has been strictly by the
     book. Now, suddenly, out of the blue, you're a "cowboy"?

     BARRETT
     What are you guys saying? You think that I've been brainwashed.

     TEAL'C
     The technology is readily available to the Goa'uld who infiltrated
     the Trust. Their loyalty is to Ba'al.

     CARTER
     Somebody must have given him the specs to our anti-beaming
     technology. It's the only way he could've known that the combined
     signal would be enough to punch through.

     BARRETT
     Yeah, I agree with that. But it wasn't me.

     MITCHELL
     Ba'al's plan hinged on knowing in advance he'd have the opportunity
     to get out of that cell. He knew you were coming.

     BARRETT
     And this is crazy.

   [Barrett gathers his papers and stands, picking up his briefcase.]

     CARTER
     You didn't know you were doing anything wrong.

     BARRETT
     I gotta go. I'm due back in Washington.

     LANDRY

     You're not going anywhere.

     (to guards)
     Sergeant.

   [Two guards approach.]

     LANDRY

     (to Barrett)
     Hand over your weapon.

   [Barrett looks at Landry, then opens his coat wider, allowing one of
   the guards to remove his gun from its holster. Barrett looks at
   Carter.]

     BARRETT
     Sam, you know this isn't true.

   [Carter looks away. Barrett leaves with the guard escort.]

     CARTER
     Sir, I'm sorry. I should never have given Ba'al that code.

     LANDRY
     You had no way of knowing. Under the circumstances, you did the
     right thing.

     CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

   [Landry leaves. Teal'c and Vala follow. Carter sits against the table.
   Mitchell sits beside her.]

     MITCHELL
     So, what do you think? You think Ba'al really has a way of figuring
     out where that weapon is?

     CARTER

     (softly)
     Hard to say. I mean, Anubis knew the addresses of all those planets,
     and he never found it. Mind you, there was only one of him.

     MITCHELL
     Says you.

   [Carter sniffs in mild laughter and nudges Mitchell with her shoulder.]
