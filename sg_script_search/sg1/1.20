TEASER
INT--STARGATE ROOM--P3R-233
[SG-1 enters a darkened room through the Stargate. The team has to use
flashlights to see.]
O'NEILL
(brightly)
Good morning, campers.
[Daniel is videotaping the room's interior.]
TEAL'C
There is damage. It appears to have been done by Goa'uld weaponry. I
do not believe this battle took place recently.
DANIEL
No bodies.
CARTER
(Examining some sort of device)
Daniel. Do you recognize any of these symbols?
[Daniel goes to where Carter is looking.]
DANIEL
No. This place is definitely alien.
[The team continue to search the interior. Daniel is viewing something
through his camera.]
DANIEL
Wonder what's behind curtain number two.
O'NEILL
Take Carter, and check it out.
[Carter and Daniel leave the room, while O'Neill and Teal'c continue to
look around. O'Neill sees a large dark symbol.]
O'NEILL
Whoa. Teal'c, you ever see anything like this before?
TEAL'C
{Sees what O'Neill is looking at.)
We must return to Earth as quickly as possible.
O'NEILL
Why? What is it?
TEAL'C
It is the symbol of Korosh-ni. It is for any Goa'uld or Jaffa who
may pass through the Gate. Loosely translated it means, "Turn back."
O'NEILL
Does it...elaborate?
TEAL'C
It is place on worlds Goa'uld destroyers have wiped out and left
contaminated. This planet's entire surface will be, in your terms,
radioactive.
O'NEILL
Ah.
TEAL'C
No one will be left alive. This place is not safe.
INT--ARTIFACT ROOM P3R-233
[Daniel and Carter enter the room and start looking around]
DANIEL
I think this is a lab.
CARTER
How do you know?
DANIEL
(Examining items on a long table.)
These are thing that they brought back through the Stargate from
other planets to study. They're all tagged. This is a Turkanese
mask. This is a clay cone from Lagash with cuneiform symbols on it.
O'NEILL
(Calling from outside the room)
Carter! Daniel!
CARTER
Found a souvenir shop, sir.
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter the room.]
O'NEILL
We're outa here.
DANIEL
What? Why? Thi--This place is a treasure chest of artifacts from
diverse human cultures.
O'NEILL
Daniel, I don't want to hear it. Let's go.
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c leave the room.]
DANIEL
You don't want to...hear it.
[Frustrated, Daniel, unhooks his pack and starts pulling artifacts off
the table to place in his pack. Picking up and examining one device, he
hears a noise as a mirror-like structure behind him activates. Daniel
turns to look at it and moves closer to it. Waving a hand in front of
the mirror, there is no reflection.]
O'NEILL
(Calling from outside the room)
Daniel! We're leaving. Let's go.
[Daniel reaches out a hand and touches the surface of the mirror, and
an electrical charge disburses over him. The light in the room changes,
and Daniel examines his hand.]
INT--ALTERNATE UNIVERSE (AU) STARGATE ROOM P3R-233
[Daniel runs into the room.]
DANIEL
Guys, I need a hand with this thing. It's too heavy for me to move,
but we have to take it...back.
(He cannot see his team in the room.)
Jack? Sam? Teal'c?
[The Stargate is dark.]
Oh, I really hate it when this happens.
[Daniel goes to the DHD and starts inputting Earth's Gate address.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[Daniel is on the ramp, having just stepped through the Gate and he
turns to face the event horizon. The klaxons are sounding.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Close the iris!
[Daniel watches the iris close and he turns around, starting to walk
down the ramp when he sees about a dozen SF's arming their weapons they
have trained on him. He stops short and looks at them warily.]
SF
Hands on your head. Now! Or we will open fire.
DANIEL
(Putting his hands on his head.
What's going on?
SF
Identify yourself.
DANIEL
(Confused.)
Daniel Jackson, SG-1.
[Hammond enters the Gate room and walks toward Daniel.]
DANIEL
General, what's this all about?
HAMMOND
General? You see stars anywhere on my uniform?
SF
Colonel. He says he's on SG-1
DANIEL
Colonel?
[An SF begins to handcuff Daniel's hands behind his back.]
HAMMOND
How did you get an SG-1 remote iris deactivation device?
DANIEL
What are you talking about?
[The klaxons begin to sound.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Unauthorized incoming travelers.
HAMMOND
Who the hell are you?
[A puzzled Daniel can only stare as the scene fades out.]
END TEASER
ROLL OPENING CREDITS
INT--AU SGC INFIRMARY
[A doctor is filling a syringe from a vile. Daniel is heard protesting
out in the hallway as the doors burst open and the SF's drag him into
the MRI room.]
DANIEL
I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson, SG-1! I need to see Jack O'Neill! Ask Sam
Carter! Come on!
DOCTOR
On the bed.
[They haul him up on the MRI bed. His hands are cuffed in front and
both SF's restrain him on the table.]
DANIEL
I am not a Goa'uld!
(He sees the doctor with the syringe.)
Don't give me that! Where's Dr. Fraiser? Don't give me that.
(Daniel is injected.)
Ahhhh!
(Breathing deeply.)
I am Dr. Daniel Jackson. I need to see Colonel O'Neill.
SF
You mean General O'Neill?
[Daniel is seemingly unable to speak anymore as he sees a familiar
person in the infirmary before passes out.]
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[Daniel slowly wakes up and sits up to examine his surroundings.
Standing, he finds his glasses on a table and puts them on, then goes
to the door. It's locked.]
DANIEL
(knocking)
Hello!
(kicks the door.)
I have to speak to someone!
[He pounds on the door again, then walks away shaking his hand as if in
pain. Through the window a Marine is seen approaching. The door is
unlocked, the Marine walks in followed by Catherine Langford.]
DANIEL
Catherine!
CATHERINE
You know me?
DANIEL
Of course. You don't know me?
CATHERINE
Dr. Daniel Jackson. Linguist, Ancient Egyptian Historian. Better
known for some of your more radical ideas. At the moment, I am more
interested in how you came through my Stargate.
DANIEL
How I-- Your Stargate? What the hell is going on here, Catherine?
CATHERINE
I prefer you address me as Dr. Langford. You were wearing a remote
device when you came through the Gate. You had SG-1's code. How did
you obtain it?
DANIEL
How did I-- How do you think I did it? I left from here: Stargate
Command. Today. A few hours ago. I went through on a mission
to--to--to P3R-233.
CATHERINE
What are you talking about? You've never been in this facility until
now.
DANIEL
(chuckles)
Okay, um. *I* figured out how to work the Stargate. You recruited me
to translate the cartouche found at Giza. *I* went through on the
first mission through the Stargate to Abydos. And unless the last
two years have been some wacky, wacky dream, I am a member of SG-1.
CATHERINE
Not as far as I'm concerned.
DANIEL
Wh--what?
CATHERINE
I supervised the team that translated the cartouche found at Giza.
DANIEL
You did?
CATHERINE
I admit we referenced your work occasionally. I even went to meet
you at one of your seminars to ask you to joins us. But you said no.
DANIEL
I did?
CATHERINE
You were quite rude, actually.
DANIEL
Oh, I was?
CATHERINE
(Sighs and looks at a report.)
The MRI confirms you are not a Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Could I see Captain Carter?
CATHERINE
Samantha Carter?
DANIEL
Yes!
CATHERINE
She's not in the military. She's a doctor. Ph.D. Astrophysics. She's
attending to more important business at the moment. Don't you have
any explanation for this?
DANIEL
(Scoffs)
No! God, no! Catherine--! I-- I mean, Dr. Langford-- No, this
doesn't make any sense. I--I *know* you! I belong here! You...don't.
CATHERINE
(offended)
Excuse me?
DANIEL
You were retired. Uh, at least the Air Force made you retire. You
are supposed to be at home, living happily ever after with Ernest.
CATHERINE
(Shocked)
What?
DANIEL
The man you were supposed to marry in 1945.
[Catherine is stunned speechless.]
INT--AU SGC--GENERAL O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[Colonel Hammond is addressing General O'Neill.]
HAMMOND
We've only got 50 percent of the list through to the beta site,
General. Voyager is still en route.
[Catherine walks in.]
CATHERINE
Excuse me, I know you're a little busy right now.
O'NEILL
It's all right, Catherine. What is it?
CATHERINE
I think you should meet the young man who came through the Gate,
Jack.
O'NEILL
Now?
CATHERINE
How much time do we have?
O'NEILL
Why?
CATHERINE
(a bit freaked out)
He...knows things.
[O'Neill leaves the room leaving Hammond.]
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is standing nervously at the table. A guard is posted at the
wall. Daniel looks up.]
DANIEL
Jack!
O'NEILL
Look, we're in the middle of a situation right now. I don't know who
you are, but Dr. Langford says you might be able to help us?
DANIEL
Okay. This is starting to get a little bit spooky. Now, a few hours
ago, everything about this place was different. I mean, well, I
mean, not complete different. I mean, you're still you...sort of.
[O'Neill looks at Catherine, puzzled, then looks back at Daniel.]
O'NEILL
What can you tell me about the Goa'ulds?
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
The Goa'uld. You know who they are?
DANIEL
Uhhhh. Yeah?
O'NEILL
Tell me what you know.
DANIEL
Okay. Now, maybe I've completely lost my mind here,
(Daniel moves toward O'Neill and the guard steps closer to Daniel)
but as far as I'm concerned, we know each other very well. You know
everything that I know.
[O'Neill just stares at him.]
DANIEL
(Daniel pulls at his jacket sleeve where the SG-1 patch is.)
Look, I'm a member of SG-1 with you, Captain Carter, and Teal'c!
(Daniel looks around suddenly.)
Wher-- where is Teal'c?
[O'Neill looks at him.]
DANIEL
Uh, big guy. Gold emblem on his head. Goa'uld in his stomach. You
can't miss him.
O'NEILL
A Jaffa?
DANIEL
Yes. He's our--our friend?
O'NEILL
(disgustedly)
Get this man out of here, now!
CATHERINE
(Follows O'Neill)
How'd he come through the Gate? How does he know the things he
knows?
DANIEL
(The guard has a hold of Daniel.)
According to Dr. Langford, you solved the Gate without me. Did you
still go to Abydos with the intention of blowing up a nuclear
device?
O'NEILL
(Looks at Daniel more intently.)
How did you know that?
DANIEL
You were willing to commit suicide because your son had recently
died. He-- he shot himself with your gun, right?
[O'Neill looks now at Catherine.]
CATHERINE
I swear I didn't tell him anything.
[O'Neill moves back into the room.]
DANIEL
So, did you still go to Chulak?
CATHERINE
What is Chulak.
DANIEL
The Jaffa home world.
CATHERINE
Do you know the symbols?
DANIEL
Yes.
[Catherine moves to the table and opens up a notebook.]
DANIEL
What, do you want me to write it down?
CATHERINE
(impatiently)
Yes!
DANIEL
(Sighs and starts to write down the symbols.)
So, if you've never been to Chulak, you've probably never even met
Teal'c.
O'NEILL
Teal?
DANIEL
No, Teal'c!
(finishes writing, and throws down the pen and walks away from the
table)
Oh, everything's screwed up. Why?
[Carter, wearing civilian clothes and long hair, makes her way up the
steps to the briefing room. Daniel turns and sees her.]
DANIEL
Sam!
[She stops short when she sees him, then looks at O'Neill.]
CARTER
Who is this?
CATHERINE
Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
Of course.
CATHERINE
The young man who came through the Stargate with the SG-1 remote
code.
O'NEILL
Report, Doctor?
CARTER
We've lost Washington and Philadelphia, sir.
DANIEL
(looking from one person to the next)
I'm sorry. What do you mean by lost?
[Carter looks to O'Neill for guidance.]
O'NEILL
(Shrugs)
Show him.
[Carter makes a hand gesture to follow her, and all leave the room.]
INT--AU SGC STARGATE CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Catherine, and Daniel descend the stairs and enter.]
DAVIS
We're locking in coordinates.
[Carter leads them to a map on the wall with various red markings on
it.]
CATHERINE
Every one of those red dots is a destroyed city.
[The map depicts Europe and it major cities with red dots covering
them. Daniel looks at Catherine.]
SGC MAN VOICE OVER
Dr. Carter. There's another report coming on.
[The group move over to a television monitor.]
TV ANCHORMAN VOICE OVER
All military efforts to engage the alien ships have proven
inconsequential.
DANIEL
The Goa'ulds?
CARTER
The Ships appeared four days ago.
TV ANCHORMAN
As is Europe, Asia, and Africa, they have slowly begun
systematically annihilating all signs of civilization.
[The television shows images of structures burning and explosions.]
TV ANCHORMAN
Starting on the East Coast and moving west with frightening
inevitability. There has been no response to attempted
communications with the aliens.
[Close up on Daniel as he watches intently the news of the destruction
of this version of Earth.]
TV ANCHORMAN
Thus far, they have left no survivors in the wake of their seemingly
unstoppable wave of destruction.
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is pacing around the room]
DANIEL
I feel like a victim of the biggest practical joke ever.
CATHERINE
You got all this on the alien planet you talked about?
DANIEL
Uh.... Yeah, with the exception of the gun and the grenade. I found
this lab. They obviously collect things that they found on other
planets. There was this mirror, like a slab of rock. Could have been
made of naquadah, the Gate element. I don't know. Jack called me,
said we were leaving, I touched the mirror.
CATHERINE
(Examining the handheld device that Daniel activated the mirror with
earlier.)
Interesting. What is it?
DANIEL
I have no idea.
CATHERINE
You said you touched a mirror.
DANIEL
Well, Actually I touched that thing first. It turned on. I heard a
noise. That's when I noticed the shimmering.
CATHERINE
Maybe this is what controls it.
DANIEL
When I touched the mirror, there was this surge. It was like getting
an electrical shock just for a second. And--and then I went to find
Jack, Sam, and Teal'c.
CATHERINE
He's the Jaffa you say is on SG-1 with you?
DANIEL
Yes! But I couldn't find them. It was like they were just gone. So
I-- I figured that maybe they left without me. So I--I dialed in
Earth's address, I came though, and I--
(Daniel is standing by the briefing room window and looks down on to
the Gate room when he hears the Stargate activate.)
What the hell are they doing down there?
[Catherine gets up from her seat and joins Daniel at the window. Gazing
down on to the ramp, they see soldiers and technicians standing around
a nuclear device on the ramp, poised for deployment.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron One encoded.
INT--AU SGC STARGATE CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel and Catherine are hurriedly making their way down the stairs.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron Two encoded.
[Daniel walks over to where Carter is seated and looks out at the
Gate.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron Three encoded.
CARTER
(to O'Neill, who is at the other end of the room.)
Sir, isn't our mission to get the genesis list through to the beta
site?
O'NEILL
I think we'll try to stop the attack on Earth first.
DANIEL
(to Catherine)
What is this Genesis list? Beta site? What does she mean?
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron Four encoded.
CATHERINE
We're evacuating everyone we can to another planet: World leaders,
Scientists, doctors.
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron Five encoded.
MAN, VOICEOVER
Let's commence the seismic enlargement, 85 percent.
[Daniel notices his paper where he'd written down the address to Chulak
is in front of the technician at the Gate control panel who is
inputting the coordinates.]
DANIEL
(to O'Neill)
You're sending a nuclear weapon to Chulak?
O'NEILL
You got a problem with that?
DANIEL
The Jaffa aren't your enemy. They're just slaves.
O'NEILL
(impatiently)
All right. Try to comprehend what's going on here. We estimate the
death toll to Earth as 1.5 billion.
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Chevron Six engaged.
O'NEILL
Who do you think is flying those ships trying to blow up our world,
hmm? You give me one good reason why I shouldn't be striking back.
AIRMAN
Chevron Seven locked.
[The wormhole engages and Daniel can only stare at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
They have no choice.
O'NEILL
(turns away from Daniel)
Send the bomb.
AIRMAN
(into the microphone)
Proceed with deployment.
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[The bomb is sent via remote control through the event horizon.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[All watch as the iris closes.]
AIRMAN OVER P.A.
Iris is locked.
O'NEILL
Proceed with evacuation until that next warhead is ready.
DANIEL
(incredulously, to O'Neill)
You know there are innocent human beings on most of the Goa'uld
planets, don't you?
O'NEILL
(to Catherine)
Unless this man has more information we can use, I don't want to see
him again.
[O'Neill stalks out of the room, while Carter and Catherine look at
Daniel.]
DANIEL
(looks at Catherine, then sighs heavily.)
This isn't happening. This is nuts. This isn't happening. This isn't
happening.
[He walks away and puts a hand to his head while he thinks.]
DANIEL
Is it-- is it possible that the Stargate malfunctioned or went
haywire, and--and--and I came through into a totally screwed-up
different version of Earth?
CARTER
No, I doubt that. The Stargate uses space/time to create a wormhole
that allows us to travel across great distances, but it doesn't take
you to an alternate reality.
DANIEL
Alternate reality?
CARTER
Well, basically, scientists have theorized that there are an
infinite number of dimensions, each containing a different possible
version of reality.
DANIEL
Well, it sounds like I theoretically, possibly, actually found one.
CATHERINE
One what?
DANIEL
What Sam said. A--A--A alternate reality. A parallel plane. Wouldn't
that explain why everything here is the same, but...different?
CARTER
Okay, the theory is that there are an infinite number of alternate
realities, some of them are very different, and some are almost
identical.
DANIEL
That has to be what this is.
(He looks from Carter to Catherine.)
So this isn't my world at all. This is some sort of--
(chuckles)
other dimension?
CARTER
Yeah, but the Stargate wouldn't cause that.
CATHERINE
(pensively)
Maybe it wasn't the Stargate that caused it.
CARTER
What are you suggesting?
CATHERINE
He found a mirror, possibly made of naquadah on P3R-233.
DANIEL
All of this started to happen after I touched it.
CARTER
P3R-233?
DANIEL
What, have you been there?
CARTER
Yes.
[The Stargate whirrs into motion.]
AIRMAN
Offworld activation.
CARTER
Close the blast doors and keep the iris sealed.
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
We're receiving coded transmissions from Air Force One.
CARTER
Notify General O'Neill. Catherine, the rest of the Genesis travelers
will have to be briefed and ready to go.
CATHERINE
Right.
[Both Carter and Catherine walk away as the control buzzes with
activity. Daniel looks around and spots an unmanned computer terminal.
Walking over to it, he sits down and types in a few commands. The
screen reads "Find:" and he types in "Jackson, Daniel." Momentarily, he
sees his picture on screen with details.]
DANIEL
(reading)
"Current address unknown, phone number unknown, last place of
residence, Egypt as of 1997."
[Turning away from the computer, he sees something and rises. Carter is
working at a control panel, as Daniel goes over to the wall map and
looks it over.]
DANIEL
Uh oh.
[Carter looks up and sees him.]
CARTER
What?
DANIEL
(motioning to the map)
I think I'm dead.
CARTER
What?
DANIEL
The me in this reality.
[Cut to Hammond and O'Neill coming down the stairs.]
HAMMOND
What is Voyager' status, doctor?
CARTER
The President's plane is ten minutes from Peterson Air Force Base.
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
Another coded transmission in progress.
CARTER
Relay it through the decoder and patch it through the speaker.
[Carter walks away from Daniel and over to where Hammond and O'Neill
are standing. O'Neill has a phone to his ear.]
MAN'S VOICE OVER RADIO TRANSMISSION
Enemy craft--pursuit cannot evade.
AIRMAN
Surface radar is tracking.
[Daniel comes over and joins them as they track Air Force One's
progress on the radar screen.]
O'NEILL
That's one of their big ones.
CARTER
Look how fast it's moving.
MAN'S VOICE OVER RADIO TRANSMISSION
Under fire! Help...us!
[Tight shot of the radar screen as a large blip moves in on Air Force
One's smaller blip. There is rapid beeping as the screen displays
"AIRFORCE 1 TRACKING LOST." There is silence in the room as they look
on.]
CARTER
It's heading straight for us.
O'NEILL
Confirm, Airman.
AIRMAN
Trajectory confirmed. ETA, one minute.
O'NEILL
Damn it! Evacuation gave us away.
CARTER
Intelligence has confirmed that the enemy ships have the firepower
to reach us, even this far underground.
HAMMOND
And we're stuck here as long as the Gate's under attack.
AIRMAN
Enemy ship is slowing down. Visual tracking in ten seconds.
[Hammond, Daniel, Carter, and O'Neill look up at the monitors as they
see the entrance of Cheyenne Mountain become cloaked in the shadow of a
Goa'uld mother ship. Goa'uld fighters are seen buzzing around the
mountainside.]
CARTER
If they fire on us, chances are we won't even feel it. Blasts on the
East Coast were the equivalent of 200 Megaton nuclear warheads.
DANIEL
It's not going to fire.
CARTER
What?
DANIEL
It's landing.
[All in the room look at the monitor as the mother ship lowers itself
over the mountaintop.]
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel, Carter, Catherine, Hammond, O'Neill, and a few other military
men are standing at the table reviewing battle plans.]
HAMMOND
The surveillance cameras outside the main tunnel entrance show Jaffa
assembling what appears to be a weapon. Looks like they're coming in
the font door. Sir.
O'NEILL
(points over schematics of the mountain.)
All right, position automatic weapons here and here, men in all
these halls. Cut off every access to this level. Blow the secondary
elevator shaft now.
HAMMOND
If the men at the surface have to fall back--
O'NEILL
There's only going to be one way down. I want all nonessential
personnel through the Gate to the beta site, ASAP. Dr. Langford,
that includes you and our...guest.
CARTER
Sir, the Goa'ulds have been keeping a wormhole established from
offworld.
DANIEL
That's probably because you sent that bomb through to Chulak.
CARTER
The point is, unless we get another window of opportunity to open
the Gate from here, we're all stuck.
O'NEILL
Recommendations?
CARTER
Well, under normal circumstances, when we have full power, we can
only keep a wormhole established for about a half hour. There may be
a restriction on how long the Goa'ulds can keep theirs active from
offworld.
O'NEILL
So there's a time limit?
CARTER
Right.
[O'Neill looks from Carter to Hammond, then leaves the room.]
INT--AU SGC HALLWAY
[O'Neill places a pack of C4 on an elevator door.]
O'NEILL
Start it up. Give it a count of five, then blow it.
MARINE
Yes, sir.
[O'Neill and the men take cover around a corner, and the elevator shaft
blows up. O'Neill and the men then separate.]
O'NEILL
Good luck.
(heads for another elevator with two more marines.)
Let's go. Take it up.
MARINE
Yes, sir.
[They enter the elevator and the doors close as O'Neill barks an
indistinct order into his radio/mic.]
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING
[Daniel is adjusting the controls of a tape player. He has a headphone
to one ear.]
DANIEL
The first part sounds like a derivation of Ancient Egyptian.
CATHERINE
We couldn't recognize it.
DANIEL
(to Catherine)
Oh, you didn't learn how to speak it aloud on Abydos.
[Catherine looks at Carter.]
DANIEL
(stops the tape)
Where did this come from?
CATHERINE
It's a deep-space transmission our receivers picked up about three
months ago.
DANIEL
So...why are you showing this to me now?
CARTER
Because the transmission originated from the same quadrant of space
as P3R-233
CATHERINE
Where your mirror is.
[Explosions can be heard and the lights in the room flicker.]
CARTER
We went to 233 after we received the transmission, but the
civilization had been destroyed by the Goa'ulds. We didn't find any
mirror, though.
[Daniel takes a pen and starts to write on the paper.]
CARTER
(reading his writing)
"Beware the destroyers."
CATHERINE
Some of the 233 aliens must have sent out the warning before their
civilization was destroyed by the Goa'ulds.
CARTER
[watching Daniel write.)
What does the rest say?
DANIEL
It just says, "They come from..." but th--the sentence is
incomplete. There's just more sounds, pulses or beats of some kind.
CARTER
Yeah. We've analyzed them.
[More explosions.]
CARTER
They're divided into groups: 3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and 12.
[Daniel writes them down and looks at them.]
DANIEL
That's six numbers.
CARTER
Yeah.
DANIEL
That's a Stargate address, just without the point of origin.
[Carter looks at Catherine.]
DANIEL
(reads)
"Beware the destroyers. They come from 3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and 12."
CATHERINE
Could the aliens on 233 found out where the Goa'uld attack
originated from?
CARTER
What, like a Goa'uld home world?
DANIEL
Or at least a--a military base. They must have assigned a number to
each symbol on the Stargate. It's a code! All we need to do is
figure out which symbol the aliens used to represent the number one
and start counting from there.
CARTER
Well, the only unique symbol they would have is the point of origin
for 233.
CATHERINE
But that symbol may not even be on our Stargate.
DANIEL
Except I have the alien Gate on tape.
CARTER
What?
[Daniel pulls out his video camera. In the meantime, the Gate is
rumbling and Catherine rises to see what's going on.]
CATHERINE
The Gate is off.
[All three race to the stairs.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Catherine, and Daniel are hurrying down the stairs.]
CARTER
Start dialing the Gate for the beta site!
AIRMAN
Chevron one's already encoded.
CARTER
If we can dial in before the Goal'ulds can reestablish a wormhole,
we'll be able to get out of here.
AIRMAN
Chevron Two encoded.
DANIEL
Can they dial in here once we've started dialing out?
CARTER
Yes. We have to get the seventh chevron locked in order to stop an
incoming wormhole.
AIRMAN
Chevron Three encoded.
INT--SGC HALLWAY DOOR A-2, LEVEL 2
[O'Neill is leading troops through the halls]
O'NEILL
Everybody ready?
MAN
Sir!
MAN #2
Let's do it, boys!
MAN #3
Right, sir!
MAN #4
Yes, sir!
[O'Neill locks his weapon and the men take their positions in the hall.
The door blasts open, and the men open fire on the doorway.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is spinning.]
AIRMAN
Chevron five encoded.
[Daniel, Catherine, and Carter look on at the Gate spins.]
DANIEL
Come on, come on, come on.
[As the sixth symbol is about to engage, the Gate shuts down.]
CARTER
(Frustrated)
No!
AIRMAN
Offworld activation!
CATHERINE
You're going to have to make the computer dial in faster for the
next time.
CARTER
I'll see what I can do.
CATHERINE
How long can the Goa'uld keep the wormhole active?
CARTER
Well, based on the start and end of their last activation, it looks
like they can keep one established from offworld for 38 minutes.
DANIEL
We may not have that much time.
INT--AU SGC HALLWAY A2, LEVEL 2
[Jaffa warriors are making their way into the hallway with staff
weapons firing. SGC personnel are returning fire.]
O'NEILL
Fall back!
MAN
Fall back!
[SGC personnel make their way back down the hall.]
MAN
Go! Go!
[They continue to fire on the Jaffa as they make their way through the
hallway.]
O'NEILL
Seal it off and move down
[At the doorway, a Serpent Guard enters the hall. The helmet opens and
Teal'c is revealed behind the mask.]
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[A television monitor shows the 233's Stargate and its seventh
chevron.]
DANIEL
This symbol has to be the point of origin.
[Daniel is writing down the symbols on paper. Hammond, Catherine, and
Carter are in the room as O'Neill walks in.]
HAMMOND
How's it going up there, General?
O'NEILL
Getting' the crap beat out of us. How's it going here?
CARTER
I'm estimating it will be 25 before we can try to open the Gate
again.
HAMMOND
And when we do, Dr. Langford here has presented us with an
interesting dilemma. She seems to think we've been handed the
address to a Goa'uld home world possibly where this attack
originated.
O'NEILL
We'll send a bomb through.
DANIEL
Excuse me?
(tears off the paper from the tablet)
Um, I know you think of me as an outsider here, but what good will
that do? I mean, forget the fact that it won't change what's
happening here, how do you know they don't have some kind of iris
like yours? I mean, this could all be for nothing.
CARTER
Yeah, we probably only have one shot at dialing out. If we use that
one opportunity to dial a Goa'uld world, we'll never get out of here
ourselves.
[Cut to Daniel's videotape on the monitor. AU SGC personnel look on as
they see their doubles wondering through the Stargate room on P3R-233.]
CATHERINE
My God!
O'NEILL
(moving closer to the monitor)
What the hell's that?
DANIEL
(smiling)
My reality.
CARTER
(amused)
We are actually looking at ourselves in a parallel universe.
(chuckles)
Another version of our lives that-- that actually exists. It's
incredible.
O'NEILL
It's supposed to be theoretical.
CARTER
Not anymore. What first began with Einstein's theories about
relativity--
HAMMOND
(points at the screen)
Who is this?
[The video zooms in on Teal'c.]
DANIEL
(Fondly)
That is Teal'c. Big guy, gold emblem on his head, Goa'uld in
his...stomach.
CATHERINE
We just saw him on the security camera. He's the Jaffa that led the
invasion into the base.
DANIEL
Well, he was, and probably still is, the First Prime of Apophis. He
would be charged with the most important mission. Look, this is
going to sound pretty selfish, but where I come from none of this
has happened yet. In my reality, the Earth that I know still has a
chance.
O'NEILL
You want to explain that?
DANIEL
If this address really does lead to the Goa'uld world where this
attack originated and I can get this information back to my world,
then maybe I can stop this before it starts there.
CARTER
Wh--What makes you think the Goa'ulds are even going to try
attacking Earth in your universe?
DANIEL
Oh, I'd say we've pissed the Goa'uld off just as much as you have,
probably even more.
O'NEILL
All right. W--Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You want us
to give up what might be our last chance to strike back at the
Goa'ulds so we can save ourselves in a-- in a--
(to Carter)
Wh--what?
CARTER
Alternate reality.
DANIEL
Not just yourselves, everyone on Earth.
O'NEILL
Your Earth!
DANIEL
The Jack O'Neill that I know would do it.
O'NEILL
Well, apparently, you and I have never met.
DANIEL
No...I guess not.
[O'Neill looks intently at him.]
DANIEL
Look, all I know is that because I came here, I have seen what can
happen.
(Strongly)
Now I have a chance to keep this from happening to the Earth that I
come from, if you help me.
[Hammond and Catherine look at O'Neill and O'Neill looks pensive. He
looks to Carter.]
O'NEILL
(sighs)
How much time, Doctor?
[Lights flicker.]
CARTER
22 minutes.
O'NEILL
All right, so the argument is academic. We can never hold them that
long anyway.
DANIEL
(Thinking)
Well, maybe we can buy some time.
O'NEILL
How?
DANIEL
Not how. Who.
INT--AU SGC HALLWAY
[A Jaffa is lowering a large staff weapon through a hole in the ceiling
to a lower floor where Teal'c is supervising the operation. He moves
into a hallway.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Teal'c image appears on a security monitor. Teal'c turns and takes aim
at the camera and discharges his staff weapon. Catherine, Daniel,
O'Neill, Carter, and Hammond watch.]
O'NEILL
Whoa.
(chuckles lightly and turns to Daniel)
You're kidding, right?
DANIEL
You saw the videotape. In my reality, Jack O'Neill convinced Teal'c
to betray Apophis to save our lives. Teal'c gave up everything for
the slim chance that we could help free his people from slavery.
O'NEILL
It doesn't exactly look like we could help him do anything right
now. Keep in mind that we just sent a bomb off to his planet. There
might not be anything left for him to save.
DANIEL
Not in this universe.
[O'Neill turns away, and Daniel turns to Catherine, then back while
O'Neill thinks about it.]
O'NEILL
You expect me to explain all this to him, don't you?
DANIEL
He's very smart. I'll bet he'll understand.
CARTER
How do you know he's even remotely the same Jaffa you know in your
universe?
CATHERINE
Not everything's the same here.
DANIEL
No, it's not. But it is close. Look, I know what I am asking here,
it's insane.
(softly)
Look, if you don't want to help, I understand. It's your lives and
it's your world.
[O'Neill looks at him as Carter and Hammond look on, resigned.]
O'NEILL
(shaking his head)
All I really have to do is buy a little time, a few minutes to get
the Gate open, right?
CATHERINE
That videotape of that Jaffa and you together should catch his
attention.
[Daniel looks around and goes to the television monitor.]
HAMMOND
You're going to talk to this guy about alternate realities?
[O'Neill just shakes his head slightly.]
CARTER
(walks up to O'Neill)
Do you really think he's right about this Jaffa?
O'NEILL
He was right about my son.
[Daniel comes back and hands him the video camera. O'Neill takes it and
looks at him.]
DANIEL
(sincerely)
Thank you.
[O'Neill again shakes his head, disbelievingly, then looks at the
assembled group.]
O'NEILL
I think this is where you all wish me good luck.
[O'Neill turns and walks away.]
CARTER
Jack.
[Carter walks over to O'Neill as he turns, and they embrace. Daniel
stares dumbfoundedly at the two of them, then turns to look at
Catherine.]
CATHERING
I take it they're not engaged in your reality.
DANIEL
No.
[Daniel turns back and watches as O'Neill turns and leaves.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[Hammond is addressing the troops]
HAMMOND
The enemy will most likely penetrate this level any time now. But
every minute counts. If and when we get the Stargate open from our
end, we will retreat through it. But until then, we must keep them
away from the control room and the Stargate at any cost. Understood?
MEN
Yes, sir!
HAMMOND
Your efforts and your dedication have always made me proud to serve
with all of you.
MAN
Bravo Company, move out! Formation three.
INT--AU SGC HALLWAY
[The Jaffa are positioning their staff cannon at a door. Teal'c looks
on when the door opens. Teal'c turns around, staff weapon drawn.]
TEAL'C
Kree Shak!
O'NEILL
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed!
(Pulls his cap off.)
I surrender.
[The Jaffa continue to point their staffs at O'Neill, while Teal'c
strides over to him and glares at him.]
TEAL'C
And you are?
O'NEILL
General Jack O'Neill, Commander of this base. You're Teal'c, right?
JAFFA WARRIOR
Hagga shak!
TEAL'C
(holds a hand up to the warrior)
Ha're kree.
O'NEILL
You'll be wondering how I know your name.
(Teal'c glowers at him.)
I've got quite a story to tell you.
[Teal'c considers his words.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Catherine, and the Airman are seated at the control.]
CARTER
Okay, I've got the dial--in time down another five seconds. Now all
we need is that wormhole to destabilize.
HAMMOND
Airman, we're going to need all the help we can get out there.
[The Airman leaves his post at the controls.]
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
We should set the base autodestruct sequence to go off two minutes
past the estimated window of opportunity for us to open the
Stargate. If the Goa'ulds want this place in one piece, I intend to
disappoint them.
[Carter inputs the orders into the computer as Catherine takes the seat
vacated by the Airman. Momentarily, the computer displays the
autodestruct message.]
COMPUTER'S VOICE
Destruct sequence activated.
[Carter and Catherine look at the screen.]
INT--AU SGC--A ROOM SOMEWHERE ON BASE
[A television monitor replays the images of Teal'c walking around the
Stargate room on P3R-233. O'Neill is at the controls of the video
camera.]
TEAL'C
What sort of deception is this?
[Teal'c continues to stare at the monitor.]
O'NEILL
I know it's a little hard to believe. But you guys are pretty
advanced. You must know this alternate reality thing is possible,
right?
TEAL'C
(looks at O'Neill)
I do not.
O'NEILL
Well, then how did this Daniel guy know your name? He says the guy
in this video--you, I guess, in his world--hates being a slave to
the Goa'ulds.
TEAL'C
(uncertainly)
Lies.
[Teal'c turns away from O'Neill clearly disturbed by what he's been
told.]
O'NEILL
Look, I know this sounds insane. But you have a chance to change
things in his world. We just need a little time, that's all.
(He watches Teal'c ponder the idea.)
This guy Daniel says the Teal'c in his world is a good man, that he
betrayed the Goa'uld for a chance to free his people, to free his
family. Your wife. Your son, Ryac.
[Teal'c turns to face O'Neill, anger in his eyes.]
TEAL'C
We received word from my home world. You sent a weapon of
destruction there through your Stargate.
[O'Neill closes his eyes.]
TEAL'C
(icily)
My people, my family are dead.
[Teal'c moves around to the Staff cannon, maneuvers it into position,
and as O'Neill looks on, Teal'c fires.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Catherine is at the controls. Daniel and Carter are there, as well.]
CATHERINE
Four minutes. You two better get into the Gate room.
CARTER
Catherine--
CATHERINE.
Not arguments, Doctor. They need you at the beta site.
DANIEL
What about you?
CATHERINE
Soon as I start the dial-in process, I'll join you. Go!
DANIEL
If this mirror really is a doorway between our dimensions, I might
be able to send help to you from my reality or have you come through
to my Earth.
CATHERINE
Wait a second. If that device you brought is a remote control to the
mirror, you may need it.
CARTER
Go ahead. I'll get it.
[Daniel watches Carter leave, then turns back to Catherine who is
inputting information into the computer.]
DANIEL
Thank you.
CATHERINE
(Looks at Daniel warmly.)
You helped reunite me with Ernest in the other world?
[Daniel shrugs.]
CATHERINE
I guess in the grand scheme of things, we're even.
[Daniel looks at her for a few moments, nods, then heads down the
stairs to the Gate room. Catherine watches him leave.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[An explosion is heard and Daniel runs into the Gate room from the
hallway. Daniel sees Catherine through the windows of the control room
as she sits at the controls.]
INT--AU SGC HALLWAY
[The hallway is darkened, red lights flashing. Jaffa scramble in and
take position to fire on SGC personnel who have taken up defensive
positions in the corridor defending the Gate room and control room.
Hammond and the Airman and other soldiers are firing upon Jaffa.]
AIRMAN
Fall back, Colonel! We have to fall back!
[Hammond continues to fire until his weapon jams and he is eventually
shot by a staff weapon. Jaffa warriors step over Hammond's dead body
and head down the hallways toward the control room.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[Daniel turns his gaze from the Gate to Catherine in the booth.]
CATHERINE
(through the speakers)
Two minutes!
INT--AU SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter has her hands in the air and is surrounded by Jaffa warriors
aiming their weapons at her. In her hand, she holds the mirror's remote
control device. Explosions are going off in the background.]
CARTER
I surrender! I have information that can help Apophis. There is
technology that he will want to know about. This is a remote control
to an interdimensional portal. I can tell Apophis how to find it.
JAFFA WARRIOR
Macha Tre'ac
CARTER
(cautiously hands the device to the Jaffa warrior.)
Thank you.
{She pulls a grenade out of her pocket.)
Oh, yea. I also wish to blow us all to hell.
[She holds up the grenade, the pin pulled.]
INT--AU SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Catherine is still seated at the controls.]
CATHERINE
Time's up!
[There is an explosion overhead, and Catherine turns to look up the
stairwell.]
INT--AU SGC GATE ROOM
[The blast doors are closed as Daniel waits for the dial-in program to
begin. A staff weapon blast at the door draws Daniel's attention, then
the Stargate's incoming wormhole shuts down. Immediately the dial-in
program starts.]
DANIEL
(looks at the Gate)
Come on!
[The iris opens and Daniel turns toward the control room just as
Catherine is surrounded by Jaffa. The blast shield closes on the scene
as he watches, while the Stargate whirrs and spins locking the third
chevron code. Another staff blast at the door is heard, and Daniel
backs up toward the ramp.]
COMPUTER VOICE
Autodestruct in one minute.
[The computer displays the autodestruct countdown, and the Gate room's
blast door is blown open. The fifth chevron locks in as Daniel stands
waiting. Then Teal'c steps through the hole in the door and enters the
Gate room weapon raised and aimed at Daniel. Daniel stares at him,
while Teal'c stares back.]
COMPUTER VOICE
Autodestruct in thirty seconds.
[Teal'c appears to hesitate, then the outgoing wormhole establishes
itself. Daniel turns to it, and runs up the ramp. Teal'c charges his
weapon, and fires, hitting Daniel just as he enters the event horizon.
The blast shield to the control room raises and the Jaffa are working
on the computer in an attempt to shut down the autodestruct.]
COMPUTER VOICE
Autodestruct in ten seconds, nine, eight, seven...
[Teal'c stands in the Gate room awaiting the inevitable as the computer
counts down.]
COMPUTER VOICE
...six, five, four, three, two, one.
[The scene fades to white.]
INT--AU P3R-233 STARGATE ROOM
[Daniel tumbles through the Gate and down the stairs. Crawling around
the floor, he finally stands. His upper right arm is wounded. Holding
on to it and coughing, he heads toward the artifact room.]
INT--AU P3R-233 ARTIFACT ROOM
[Daniel walks in and sees the mirror. It is still active. Rushing up to
it, he holds his left hand up and touches the surface. The energy
surges over him.]
INT--P3R-233 STARGATE ROOM
[SG-1 and other SGC personnel are searching the Gate room for Daniel
using flashlights. O'Neill walks in from another room.]
O'NEILL
Any luck?
CARTER
Nothing.
[Daniel is heard crying out. O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c turn in that
direction and hurry toward where they heard him.]
INT--P3R-233 ARTIFACT ROOM
[Daniel is lying on the floor in front of the mirror, clutching his
arm. The mirror is dark.]
O'NEILL
Daniel!
[O'Neill races in and kneels down by Daniel. Carter and Teal'c follow.]
O'NEILL
(examining Daniel's shoulder wound.)
What the hell is this?
TEAL'C
It appears to have been caused by a staff weapon.
[Carter gently pulls a piece of paper out of Daniel's hand.]
CARTER
This looks like a Stargate address.
[O'Neill looks at Daniel.]
O'NEILL
All right. Let's get him back to Earth.
[O'Neill starts to pull him up, but Daniel suddenly clutches his arm.]
DANIEL
No, Jack!
(breathing heavily)
We're all in very big trouble.
[O'Neill, Teal'c, and Carter look at him and each other, puzzled.]
DANIEL
They're coming! They're coming.
