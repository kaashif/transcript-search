TEASER
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is spinning, a chevron locking in place. The Gate
activates and the iris closes. We see O'Neill in the Control Room,
standing next to a Technician. Carter walks up to join them.]
CARTER
What's up?
TECHNICIAN
Receiving GDO transmission. It's the Tok'ra, sir.
O'NEILL
Open the iris.
(smiling)
Maybe it's Dad.
CARTER
(smiling)
Maybe.
[The iris opens. O'Neill and Carter walk into the Gate room to look at
the Gate. Martouf and two other Tok'ra emerge and walk down the ramp to
speak with Carter and O'Neill.]
CARTER
Martouf. How are you?
MARTOUF
Samantha. Colonel O'Neill. Well enough, under the circumstances.
CARTER
What's wrong?
MARTOUF
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
CARTER
It's my father.
MARTOUF
I'm afraid he's been captured by Sokar.
CARTER
Oh my God.
MARTOUF
As far as we know, he is still alive.
CARTER
As far as you know?
MARTOUF
You are familiar with the way Sokar has assumed the persona of the
entity on Earth known as the Devil?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Bit pretentious, don't you think?
MARTOUF
You must understand when I say that if Selmak is still alive, he has
been sent to Hell.
O'NEILL
As in...
MARTOUF
A place of eternal suffering and damnation from which there is no
return.
TITLES
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Carter, and Martouf are walking together.]
O'NEILL
So, what are we really talking about here?
MARTOUF
Netu is a moon that orbits Sokar's home planet.
O'NEILL
A very hot moon, I take it?
MARTOUF
It is indeed a place where fire burns strong.
CARTER
But you know for sure that my father is still alive?
[Martouf stops Carter, taking her hand. O'Neill stops and turns
around.]
MARTOUF
I am sorry, Samantha. I know this must be difficult. Once captured,
Selmak and Jacob, your father, would have been brutally tortured.
But Sokar would rather see his victims suffer than die.
O'NEILL
So we're talking about a rescue mission, here.
MARTOUF
Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no one has ever escaped from Netu.
O'NEILL
Oh.
MARTOUF
No one except for Jolinar.
CARTER
Oh.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1, General Hammond, Martouf, and the other two Tok'ra are seated at
the briefing table.]
DANIEL
Of course, it makes sense. The Goa'uld impersonating the Devil would
naturally create a place like Netu. Netu is from the book of Am-Taut
which is kind of a how-to guide on passage through the ancient
Egyptian otherworld regions. And many of those regions are described
as dark places with pits of fire--home to hellish monsters and the
damned.
MARTOUF
What little we know is largely based on the legends that have been
perpetuated by Sokar himself.
O'NEILL
How did Jolinar get out?
MARTOUF
She never said.
DANIEL
No one ever asked her how she escaped from an inescapable prison?
MARTOUF
She was found unconscious and badly injured in a Teltak, a cargo
ship, floating adrift in space. Her recovery was long and painful.
She was encouraged to remember how she escaped, but she refused to
speak of it.
O'NEILL
Anyone curious as to why?
MARTOUF
I implored her, but she would not say.
CARTER
I only carried Jolinar for a short time. I've never had anything
more than scattered flashes of her memories, occasionally some
dreams, but certainly never anything like this place you're
describing.
MARTOUF
The Tok'ra have technology that aids in the recall of memories, but
you must be willing to use it.
O'NEILL
Well, if we're going in on this one, sir, we're going to need a
couple more units.
MARTOUF
A full military incursion will be impossible, Colonel O'Neill.
O'NEILL
We do covert.
MARTOUF
Selmak's recovery is obviously a high priority, however, and forgive
me, Samantha, but there is something larger at stake here. The
Tok'ra believe that Sokar is about to launch a massive attack
against the System Lords.
O'NEILL
Isn't that good news?
TEAL'C
The chaotic and feudal disorganization of the System Lords'
fragmented rule is a far more vulnerable target than that of one
powerful Goa'uld.
MARTOUF
Especially if that Goa'uld is Sokar.
HAMMOND
He's really that much worse than the others?
DANIEL
Well, of all the gods he picked to impersonate he chose the Devil.
MARTOUF
We need to find Selmak and determine what information he has
gathered about Sokar's planned attack. Without wanting to sound
overly dramatic, the fate of the Galaxy may be at stake.
O'NEILL
Sounds a bit overly dramatic.
HAMMOND
Sounds like we can't refuse. Colonel, you have a go.
CARTER
When do we leave?
MARTOUF
As soon as you're ready. If you are all sure you understand what you
are volunteering for.
DANIEL
You said Hell, right?
O'NEILL
Well, I'm going to end up there sooner or later. Might as well check
out the neighborhood, huh?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Gate is spinning, and the klaxons are sounding.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Hammond, Martouf, and O'Neill are standing behind the
Technician.]
MARTOUF
The Teltak we will require for the journey awaits us on the planet
Vorash.
O'NEILL
(surprised)
Ship?
MARTOUF
There is no Stargate on Netu. Those banished there are taken by
ship.
O'NEILL
Have I mentioned to you that I hate surprises?
MARTOUF
We have a long journey ahead of us. There will be much time to
inform you of all the details.
O'NEILL
(holding up a finger)
Ah! Now see, that puts me in a position to be surprised.
TECHNICIAN
Chevron seven is locked.
HAMMOND
Major, you will bring your father back safely.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir. We will.
EXT--VORASH
[SG-1 and the three Tok'ra are walking across the landscape from the
Stargate to the Teltak and two more Tok'ra.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA
[The transport rings engage, and SG-1 and Martouf appear.]
CARTER
This ship looks familiar.
MARTOUF
This is the same Teltak in which Jolinar was found adrift. It was
severely damaged when we found it. The essential flight mechanisms
have been repaired, however, the hyperdrive engines can only be run
at forty percent without too much risk.
[They walk to the bridge. Daniel opens a control mechanism but then
closes it quickly after O'Neill points an admonishing finger at him.
Teal'c sits down in one of the pilot seats.]
TEAL'C
Is this vessel equipped with stealth capabilities?
[Martouf looks at Carter, confused.]
CARTER
The ship we were in could make itself invisible.
MARTOUF
Really?
O'NEILL
It was an upgrade. You're obviously dealing with a base model here.
MARTOUF
Are you sure you can fly a ship such as this?
TEAL'C
With great proficiency.
MARTOUF
While we are on the surface, you may have to avoid Sokar's forces.
DANIEL
What, isn't Teal'c coming with us?
MARTOUF
He cannot. The atmosphere around the moon is impenetrable by ship.
The only way to reach the surface is in the descent pods. It is how
all the damned are sent to Netu by Sokar, and it is how we must also
arrive if we are to convince the other denizens we can be trusted.
CARTER
And there are only four pods.
MARTOUF
Correct.
O'NEILL
This counts as a surprise, you know.
MARTOUF
Shall we embark?
O'NEILL
By all means. To hell with us.
EXT--TELTAK MOVING THROUGH HYPERSPACE
INT--TELTAK BRIDGE
[Teal'c is flying the ship.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA
[Martouf walks in, joining Carter, O'Neill, and Daniel, who are seated
at various positions along one side. Daniel appears to be examining
packets of dried food.]
DANIEL
So what else can you tell us about Netu?
MARTOUF
The moon was once an industrialized colony of the planet Delmak.
When Sokar conquered Delmak and made it his home world, he
transformed the moon's environment to suit the myths.
O'NEILL
Sounds like he went to an awful lot of trouble.
MARTOUF
He filled the atmosphere with barely breathable toxins, then blasted
numerous holes in the moon's surface, releasing the molten core.
(to Carter)
As I apply the memory device, you wll feel a sharp pain.
CARTER
We've actually all experienced this technology before.
MARTOUF
(seated next to Carter)
Good. Then you will know what to expect.
[Carter nods, and Martouf pushes the memory disk to her temple. She
winces as it attaches to her.]
DANIEL
So we're actually going to to see Jolinar's memories appear
as...holographic images?
MARTOUF
There are no specific ways of targeting certain memories. Some of
Samantha's own personal memories may come out. Out of respect for
her privacy, we will not be using this part of the technology.
CARTER
Thank you.
MARTOUF
You can describe what you see.
CARTER
I'm ready.
[Martouf places the hand-held activation device against the disk on her
temple.]
INT--A HOUSE--FLASHBACK
[Chocolate chip cookies are being placed on a plate with a spatula.
Jacob Carter walks into the house.]
JACOB
Sam?
YOUNG CARTER
In here.
[Jacob walks into the kitchen. He is upset.]
YOUNG CARTER
Why are you crying?
YOUNG CARTER
(starts to cry)
Where's Mom?
(throws the spatula down)
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--PRESENT DAY
CARTER
Oh, God.
[View of O'Neill and Daniel looking worried at Carter's distress.]
MARTOUF
Listen to me, Samantha.
CARTER
I'm sorry; I'm stuck in my own past.
MARTOUF
Think of Jolinar. The last night we spent together before she was
captured by Sokar. We walked along the ridge of Noctana. There were
two moons out that night.
EXT--NOCTANA--FLASHBACK
[Martouf and Jolinar are framed by the sunset. It is a romantic
setting.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--PRESENT DAY
CARTER
I see it.
EXT--NOCTANA--FLASHBACK
[Jolinar begins to embrace Martouf.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--PRESENT DAY
CARTER
You didn't speak of Jolinar leaving. You both knew it was dangerous,
but she had to go.
EXT--NOCTANA--FLASHBACK
[Jolinar and Martouf kiss.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--PRESENT DAY
CARTER
(moved)
You stayed up all night together.
EXT--TELTAK MOVING THROUGH HYPERSPACE
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA
[O'Neill and Daniel are asleep on shelves on one side. Carter is lying
face down on a shelf on the other side; she gets up quietly, goes to
Martouf, and wakes him.]
CARTER
Martouf.
MARTOUF
Are you okay?
CARTER
I want to try it again.
MARTOUF
I should have said this earlier. I know my personal relationship
with Jolinar is a source of discomfort for you.
CARTER
Martouf...
MARTOUF
I would just like you to know, it has always been my belief that
Jolinar kept her experience on Netu a secret because she believed it
might come between us. I don't want you to hold anything back for
the same reason. You don't have to protect me.
CARTER
Okay.
[Martouf touches the device to the disk on her temple.]
INT--A DARKENED ROOM LIT BY BURNING TORCHES--FLASHBACK
[A ceremonially dressed Jaffa walks over to Jolinar with a Goa'uld pain
stick and begins to torture her with it from behind. A pale-faced man
in a hooded cloak laughs as Jolinar screams in agony.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--FLASHBACK
[Carter screams in pain. O'Neill and Daniel wake up and look over at
her.]
CARTER
(screaming)
Shut it off! Shut it off!
O'NEILL
Do it!
[Martouf places the device to the disk on her temple again, shutting it
off.]
CARTER
(gasping for breath)
I saw someone. A dark figure--I think it was Sokar. The pain was...
MARTOUF
I am sorry. The memory technology can provide very realistic sensory
recall.
CARTER
She was tortured...so badly.
MARTOUF
I am going to turn it on again, but at a lower setting.
[He touches her temple with activation device again.]
CARTER
She was on a ship like this one. They put her in a descent pod.
There was...fire all around. It was hard to breathe.
INT--NETU UNDERGROUND--FLASHBACK
[View of walking among the prisoners on Netu, into a room with an ugly
man. He leers at her, and his eyes glow.]
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA--PRESENT DAY
CARTER
It's gone. I lost it.
MARTOUF
We will arrive soon.
CARTER
I know, Martouf. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not going to to be able to do
this.
MARTOUF
(emphatic)
You have to.
O'NEILL
Hey, Marty. A word?
[O'Neill and Martouf stand up and walk to a separate area.]
O'NEILL
You're pushing a little hard, don't ya think?
MARTOUF
There is not much time left.
O'NEILL
It's her father. She knows the stakes.
MARTOUF
If she does not remember Jolinar's method of escape, I will not
allow any of you to accompany me down to the surface.
O'NEILL
Why?
MARTOUF
Because anyone who goes down there will likely not return.
O'NEILL
But you're going to go?
MARTOUF
I will attempt to locate Selmak and communicate any relevant
information to you. You will then return to Vorash and relay it the
Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
And leave you and Jacob down there to, what? Rot?
MARTOUF
With no means of escape...
O'NEILL
All right, first of all, Carter's not going to let you go without
her. Secondly, I won't let it happen; thirdly, Jolinar escaped.
MARTOUF
But if Samantha cannot recall how-
O'NEILL
Uh, uh, I know, I heard you. And forgive the bravado, but it's been
done before. It can be done again.
INT--TELTAK CARGO AREA
[Carter is sitting alone and Daniel comes to join her.]
DANIEL
You going to be okay?
CARTER
Yeah. It's just so confusing. Images and faces. Fragments of
thoughts and feelings. There was a Goa'uld on Netu. Not Sokar. He
was um...let's just say he was less than attractive. I know his
name--I can't find it. But I get this horrible, sick feeling when I
remember him.
DANIEL
Something happened between him and Jolinar.
CARTER
(nods)
Something worse than the torture and pain. Something Jolinar never
wanted Martouf to find out about.
EXT--NEAR A PLANET WITH A RED MOON--NETU
[The Teltak moves past the planet and toward the red moon.]
INT--TELTAK
[Teal'c walks from the bridge to the cargo area where the others are.]
TEAL'C
We have arrived at the coordinates.
MARTOUF
We must keep the disk concealed from any denizens we may encounter.
[He removes device from her temple and places it behind her ear.]
MARTOUF
I will leave it on a minimal setting so that you may continue to
work through Jolinar's memories as we go. Is that okay?
CARTER
Yeah, of course.
[O'Neill approaches holding a pistol in a holder.]
O'NEILL
(handing it to her)
Carter?
CARTER
Thank you.
MARTOUF
Sokar would not send someone down to Netu with weapons.
O'NEILL
Yeah, so?
MARTOUF
If they are discovered on you, the denizens will know we were not
sent by Sokar. We must attempt to blend in the hope that we will be
allowed to move about freely as denizens.
O'NEILL
(putting his pistol in the back of his pants)
Okay, we'll attempt to blend. But we're not going down there
unarmed. So, how do we communicate with Teal'c?
MARTOUF
(pulling a palm-sized device from his pocket)
We believe this device will penetrate the atmosphere.
O'NEILL
(taking device from him)
'We believe'?
MARTOUF
We should be able to speak to Teal'c as long as the ship remains in
orbit of the moon.
[O'Neill clicks the device on and off.]
INT--TELTAK BRIDGE
[As Martouf begins to work the pod controls, Daniel looks out the view
screen at the red moon below.]
DANIEL
That's uh...that's still a long way down.
MARTOUF
The pods are launched at a great velocity.
DANIEL
And that's supposed to make me feel better, or...?
MARTOUF
They are equipped with heat dampening shields and anti-gravity wave
generators that will slow our descent.
O'NEILL
So, smooth sailing all the way, right?
TEAL'C
Not exactly, O'Neill.
[The pods open and O'Neill, Martouf, Carter, and Daniel enter them in
turn, turning around to face the interior of the ship.]
TEAL'C
Are you prepared?
O'NEILL
Uh, no. Not really.
[Teal'c activates the controls to close the pods and launch them.]
TEAL'C
(into a radio)
O'Neill, can you hear me?
O'NEILL
I read you, Teal'c.
EXT--NETU'S ATMOSPHERE
[The pods are screaming through the atmosphere with hot gasses trailing
off of them.]
INT--TELTAK BRIDGE
TEAL'C
You are now entering the atmosphere...Colonel O'Neill?
EXT--NETU'S ATMOSPHERE
[Repeat shot of pods falling through atmosphere.]
TEAL'C
(worried)
O'Neill, can you hear me?
EXT--SURFACE OF NETU
[A pod opens and O'Neill stumbles out. There is a wind blowing, and
gasses are escaping from holes in the surface. O'Neill looks around
him.]
O'NEILL
(shouting)
Carter? Daniel?
DANIEL
Over here!
[O'Neill walks over toward the sound of Daniel's voice and joins them.
A wide shot shows the actively volcanic surface of the moon, the planet
taking up a large part of the dark sky.]
CARTER
This way.
O'NEILL
Let's move!
INT--BELOW SURFACE OF NETU
[View of cluttered tunnels with fires burning and red gas escaping.]
DANIEL
My lungs are burning.
O'NEILL
Well, at least it's a dry heat.
TEAL'C
(from O'Neill's radio device)
Colonel O'Neill, respond.
O'NEILL
(kneeling)
Yeah, Teal'c. We're in one piece. Just hang tight, we'll be in
touch.
CARTER
We should follow this tunnel.
MARTOUF
You remember?
CARTER
Being here has helped. This should lead us to the underground
remains of the old colony. It's one of the only inhabitable places
left.
INT--NETU TUNNELS
[They are walking through the tunnels.]
DANIEL
Is it me, or is it actually getting hotter in here?
O'NEILL
Uh, little of both, probably.
CARTER
There's something up ahead.
[Down one fork of the tunnel a lava river is flowing.]
CARTER
This way.
[She leads them to the other fork in the tunnel; there are boxes and
signs of habitation. There is the sound of people crying out.]
O'NEILL
Wow. It's certainly not Emerald City.
[We see how large the cavern is, with multiple levels and fires
burning. A group of denizens enter and surround the team.]
O'NEILL
Howdy folks. We're uh, new in these parts. I know that's hard to
tell, but it's true. Carter? Carter?
[Flashback: Jolinar sees the ugly Goa'uld from before and touches his
face. In a mirror we see her kissing him passionately. Return to
present day.]
CARTER
Bynarr!
[The denizens are shocked to hear that word and become agitated,
whispering.]
DANIEL
What does that mean?
CARTER
It's the name I couldn't remember.
(to denizens)
We've come to see Bynarr.
[A Jaffa arrives--Na'onak. His head is covered by a helmet and attached
shroud, completely covering his face.]
NA'ONAK
Who are you?
O'NEILL
People of little consequence; pay no attention to us.
NA'ONAK
Kneel before me!
O'NEILL
Who's this guy?
KINTAC
He is Na'onak, First Prime to Bynarr, Lord of Netu.
CARTER
(emphatic)
We've come to see Bynarr.
NA'ONAK
You will not. Banish them to the surface!
[O'Neill pulls his pistol, cocks it, and points it at an approaching
denizen.]
O'NEILL
I don't think so. Back off. Back off a little there, folks.
[O'Neill suddenly goes down. We see from an elevated distance a figure
wielding a Goa'uld hand device. Carter pulls her pistol and shoots an
approaching man, who keeps coming. Many denizens approach and grab
Carter, force Daniel to his knees, and hold Martouf. O'Neill is gasping
and coughing, lying on the ground.]
BYNARR
Who asks for me by name?
[He speaks in a Goa'uld voice. An oozing scar replaces his left eye,
unlike as he was in Jolinar's memories.]
CARTER
I do! I'm Samantha Carter, host of Jolinar of Malkshur.
BYNARR
(looking intrigued)
Take their weapons. Throw them in the pit.
[The denizens drag the team off after lifting O'Neill to his feet.]
O'NEILL
Of course. Pit!
INT--THE PIT
[The team is thrown down a ramp into the pit, which is a group of
prison cells below the main level. Guards lock the trap door in the
floor above them.]
O'NEILL
Thank you! The smells keep gettin' better and better, don't they?
DANIEL
This, uh, doesn't look encouraging.
[Carter looks around the area. There are other prisoners scattered
around the interconnected cells.]
DANIEL
I thought Sokar wouldn't allow any weapons. So far we've seen a
staff weapon and a hand device.
MARTOUF
I don not understand it myself.
O'NEILL
Surprise, surprise.
CARTER
Bynarr is Sokar's appointed leader. He is permitted a hand device
and one staff weapon for his First Prime.
MARTOUF
What made you think Bynarr would be sympathetic to Jolinar?
CARTER
I was sure he was the one that helped her escape.
O'NEILL
Why?
CARTER
She, uh...
[The others realize what Carter is implying. Martouf looks saddened.]
CARTER
I'm sorry. Look, he's the key. Now, Bynarr may not have knowingly
helped Jolinar, but I'm sure he must know how she escaped.
JACOB
(weak voice, off camera)
Sam? Sam?
CARTER
(sees him sitting a short distance away)
Dad?
(moves to his side)
Dad! Dad...
JACOB
(very weak and ill-looking)
Am I dreamin'?
CARTER
No, no, we're real.
JACOB
Are you crazy?
O'NEILL
Apparently.
CARTER
Are you okay?
JACOB
I been better.
MARTOUF
Selmak?
JACOB
He's dying.
MARTOUF
This will help.
[Martouf helps Jacob drink from a small bottle of green liquid. Jacob
coughs weakly.]
CARTER
Hang in there. We're going to get you outta here.
O'NEILL
Marty?
[He gestures for him to step away and join him.]
[Daniel takes off his jacket and gives it to Carter.]
CARTER
(placing jacket behind Jacob's head)
Thank you.
[Daniel goes to join O'Neill and Martouf.]
O'NEILL
He going to make it?
MARTOUF
Not here. Unless we get him out of this place soon, he will die.
[O'Neill glances at Carter, who is comforting Jacob.]
CARTER
It's okay. I'm here.

INT--SOKAR'S PALACE AND THRONE ROOM
[Bynarr walks into the throne room and kneels before Sokar, who is the
hooded man from Carter's flashback.]
BYNARR
I am humbled by your presence, my Lord Sokar.
SOKAR
Bynarr, Lord of Netu, I do not have time to hear of the sufferings
of the damned on this day.
BYNARR
Allow me to offer thanks for returning the Tok'ra Jolinar, the one
who betrayed me, so that I may seek my revenge.
SOKAR
Of what do you speak?
BYNARR
She arrived today with three others.
SOKAR
(intrigued and angry)
I did not send her to you. They are intruders. Find out what they
want, then kill them.
BYNARR
I had hoped to take my revenge on Jolinar solely, my Lord. To see
her suffer in the harshest ways of the damned.
SOKAR
Go now! Report back to me in one day. Heed my command.
BYNARR
(standing)
Without fail, my Lord.
[He leaves.]
SOKAR
(to his acolyte Jumar, the gaudily dressed Jaffa who tortured
Jolinar in Carter's flashback)
A ship brought these intruders. Find it, and destroy it.
JUMAR
Yes, my Lord.
INT--THE PIT
[Martouf is helping Jacob drink more of the green liquid.]
MARTOUF
Do you have the strength to speak?
[Jacob nods.]
MARTOUF
We can relay communication to the Tok'ra Council.
JACOB
Sokar's fleet is ten times larger than we thought. He is poised to
attack six key system lords. He will win.
MARTOUF
He will control an army big enough to rule the galaxy if that is so.
O'NEILL
When is all this supposed to happen?
JACOB
The attack was due to take place two weeks from the time I was
captured. That was four days ago.
MARTOUF
We must relay this to the Tok'ra immediately.
O'NEILL
(on communicator)
Teal'c, come in.
EXT--TELTAK IN ORBIT AROUND NETU
INT--TELTAK BRIDGE
TEAL'C

INT--THE PIT
O'NEILL
Uh, no. Not yet. Martouf wants to talk to you though.
MARTOUF
(taking device from O'Neill)
Teal'c, I have an important message you must relay to the Tok'ra
High Council if we do not get out of here.
[They hear the sound of a metal cell door opening. Martouf stops
talking and moves out of sight behind O'Neill and a rock column.]
NA'ONAK
Samantha Carter. You will come with me.
O'NEILL
Who's calling?
NA'ONAK
Now.
[He points a staff weapon at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Come and get her yourself, you--
CARTER
(whispering emphatically)
Sir! This may be our only way out of here.
O'NEILL
(doubtful)
How do you figure?
CARTER
If I could just get close to Bynarr, talk to him.
NA'ONAK
Move!
O'NEILL
(worried)
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
CARTER
Look after my dad.

though Na'onak's face is hooded. Martouf activates the communicator
again.]
INT--NETU TUNNELS
[The guards escort Carter through the large cavern and up and down
various stairs to a door. They knock.]
BYNARR
(from behind door)
Enter.
[The guards escort Carter inside to a smiling Bynarr. We see a room
witih torches, swords, and an alter-like alcove with some sort of wall
ornament. No'onak leaves to stand outside the partially open door.
Bynarr walks around Carter, leering at her. He steps to a table and
pours a goblet of water.]
BYNARR
Take it.
[Carter doesn't reach for it, so he puts it on the table.]
BYNARR
You have no symbiote within you.
CARTER
No.
BYNARR
How then do you know of Jolinar?
CARTER
I once carried her.
BYNARR
I should have known. Jolinar would have died on the surface before
she showed her face to me again.
CARTER
Because she betrayed you?
[He grabs Carter's face in one hand.]
BYNARR
(referring to his missing eye)
Look at what Sokar took from me because of her. Where is she now?
CARTER
She's dead.
BYNARR
You know how she escaped.
CARTER
I don't. I don't remember.
BYNARR
Why did you come here?
INT--THE PIT
[A woman's voice is screaming in the background.]
JACOB
Sam?
DANIEL
She'll be back.
JACOB
Where is she?
DANIEL
She's with Bynarr.
JACOB
Ah, no.
MARTOUF
Samantha believes Bynarr is the key to our escape.
JACOB
He's Sokar's eyes and ears here.
O'NEILL
Well eye, and ears.
JACOB
He ensures there are no uprisings.
O'NEILL
Keeps the conditions livable?
JACOB
And he reports to Sokar regularly. Sokar enjoys hearing about the
suffering.
O'NEILL
What's that?
MARTOUF
Sokar comes here?
JACOB
No. Bynarr goes to the planet.
MARTOUF
How do you know?
JACOB
I saw him there before I was captured.
DANIEL
You know how he gets there?
[Jacob shakes his head 'no'. Daniel and O'Neill exchange perplexed
glances.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
BYNARR
Our most recent addition is the Tok'ra Selmak. Have you come to
rescue him?
(laughing)
Did you think I helped Jolinar to escape?
CARTER
Yes.
BYNARR
Why?
CARTER
Because you loved her.
BYNARR
You are mistaken.
CARTER
Then why do hate her so much?
BYNARR
Her death has robbed me of the revenge that I have long dreamed of.
[Carter notices a star-shaped amulet on a chain around Bynarr's neck.
There is a large red crystal in the center of it.]
[Flashback: Jolinar takes the crystal out of the amulet as Bynarr
sleeps. She goes to the alcove and puts it into a keyhole in the center
device. She then steps to the middle of the room, and the transport
rings begin to activate. Return to present day. Carter looks at the
ceiling and sees a circular structure that could hold the rings.]
BYNARR
I won't get the same satisfaction from killing you, but I will get
some.
[He holds up his hand, showing the hand device.]
CARTER
No, wait!
[He begins to activate the device, then is suddenly shot from behind,
the blast coming all the way through his body. He falls dead, revealing
Na'onak standing behind in the doorway, staff weapon in hand.]
INT--THE PIT
[Carter is pushed into the cell area from the open door.]
O'NEILL
You all right?
CARTER
Yeah. Dad?
O'NEILL
He's hanging in there.
CARTER
There are transportation rings in Bynarr's quarters.
MARTOUF
They must lead to Sokar's palace.
CARTER
Yeah. Once there, Jolinar managed to steal a cargo ship and escape.
OFF-SCREEN VOICE
The Lord of Netu is dead!
O'NEILL
What's goin' on up there?
CARTER
Na'onak just killed Bynarr.
DANIEL
What? Why?
CARTER
I have no idea. Bynarr was about to kill me. Na'onak came in and
shot him with a staff weapon. He didn't say a word; he just sent me
back down here.
JACOB
The denizens will riot.
O'NEILL
This could be our shot.
DANIEL
To do what? The rings go to Sokar's palace.
O'NEILL
Hey! It's a way outta here.
CARTER
She was one person, and she had a hand device.
JACOB
Leave me.
O'NEILL
Uh, Jacob, you seem to be missing the whole point.
MARTOUF
Teal'c.
CARTER
Is that possible?
O'NEILL/DANIEL
What?
CARTER
The cargo ship has rings.
MARTOUF
The ring transportation devices work like Stargates, only over
shorter distances. They transmit a matter stream. If that matter
stream is intercepted by another receiver -
O'NEILL
(interrupting)
Whoa, whoa! Simplify, please?
CARTER
If Teal'c can maneuver the cargo ship into the correct position,
theoretically we should be able to transport directly aboard.
DANIEL
Theoretically?
O'NEILL
How does he find the right position?
MARTOUF
The ring mechanism has sensors that can locate other rings. Teal'c
should be able to detect the coordinates.
O'NEILL
I'll take those odds.
(pulls out communication device)
C'mere!
[He grabs Daniel's hand and pulls him to his feet.]
EXT--TELTAK IN ORBIT OF NETU
[Teal'c comes under attack from two death gliders. He begins to
maneuver.]
DANIEL
(over radio)
Teal'c, it's Daniel, come in.
INT--THE PIT
[Daniel and O'Neill are standing up in a different cell.]
DANIEL
Teal'c, do you copy?
TEAL'C
(with interference)
I read you, Daniel Jackson
DANIEL
Teal'c, it's Daniel, come in, over.
[The cell door opens and a denizen/guard enters.]
GUARD
What are you doing?
DANIEL
I'm just uh communicating with my friend through this little
communication device.
[As the guard approaches Daniel and O'Neill, Martouf tackles him from
the side, knocking him down. Another guard enters, and Carter kicks him
twice, then O'Neill knocks him out from behind with a piece of scrap
wood. A third guard attacks O'Neill from behind; O'Neill head-butts him
then turns and takes him out with a whack of the wood scrap. Daniel
helps Jacob to his feet and holds onto him as they all begin to leave
the cells through the now-open door.]
DANIEL
(getting desperate)
Teal'c, this is Daniel. We need you; do you copy?
INT--TELTAK BRIDGE
[Teal'c is maneuvering the ship.]
TEAL'C
I copy.
EXT--SPACE ABOVE NETU
[Teal'c is evading the two death gliders as they fire on him; it is
moving away from the moon.]
INT--TUNNELS OF NETU
[The team is taking the same path Carter took before to Bynarr's
quarters.]
CARTER
This way.
DANIEL
(to Teal'c via device)
Martouf says the ring device on the ship should be able to locate
the path the matter stream will take.
TEAL'C
I will be in position.
[Kintac sees what they are doing and leaves. O'Neill sees him.]
O'NEILL
Ah, hell.
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
[Carter pushes the door open and they enter. Daniel and Martouf are
supporting Jacob. Carter goes to Bynarr's body and checks his chest as
O'Neill barricades the door behind them.]
CARTER
It's gone. The key that activates the rings is gone.
MARTOUF
Where was the key to be inserted?
CARTER
(showing him the alcove ornament)
Over here.
[Martouf smashes the cover of the wall piece with the wooden club,
revealing a hexagonal red keyhole.]
INT--NETU TUNNELS
[A group of guards with spear-like weapons is taking the path to
Bynarr's quarters. Two guards reach the door.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
[Martouf is touching the key device.]
O'NEILL
Can you make it work?
[The guards are trying to open the barricaded door. Martouf throws the
wooden club to O'Neill, who is at the door.]
MARTOUF
It will take time.
O'NEILL
Take all you need.
INT--OUTSIDE BYNARR'S DOOR
[The two guards are joined by several large men holding a metal
grill-like structure; they begin to use it as a battering ram against
the door.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
[O'Neill is standing worried by the door, while Martouf continues to
work on the device. White lights around the red keyhole indicate some
progress. Daniel and Carter are now supporting Jacob between them.]
DANIEL
Teal'c, we're almost ready.
(static on device)
Teal'c, do you copy?
EXT--SPACE NEAR NETU
[Teal'c's Teltak is evading the death gliders, which are still firing
at it; Netu is not in sight.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
O'NEILL
We got to go.
MARTOUF
Almost.
INT--OUTSIDE BYNARR'S DOOR
[Men continue to try to beat the door down with the battering ram.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
MARTOUF
Get ready.
DANIEL
Teal'c!
[O'Neill steps over to join the others on the ring launch area.]
DANIEL
Teal'c's not responding
O'NEILL
He said he'd be there, right?
MARTOUF
If he is not...
O'NEILL
He'll be there.
INT--OUTSIDE BYNARR'S DOOR
[Men are still trying to break down the door. Na'onak arrives with
others.]
NA'ONAK
Move away!
[The men step away, and Na'onak begins to activate his hand device.]
INT--BYNARR'S QUARTERS
[Martouf is finishing his override of the lock.]
MARTOUF
Okay.
[The door bursts open to the sound and air distortion of a hand device.
Na'onak rushes in with the men behind him. They completely surround the
team, placing their hands on them.]
KINTAC
Kneel before Na'onak!
[The team is forced to their knees.]
NA'ONAK
You shall call me Na'onak no longer. From this day forth I will
reclaim my real name.
[He pulls the helmet and covering from his head, revealing that he is
Apophis. The right half of his face is scarred and partially covered in
a metal mask.]
APOPHIS
Apophis!</blockquote>
[The team reacts with surprise, hatred, and fear, and Apophis' eyes
glow briefly.]
