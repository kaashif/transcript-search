TEASER
EXT--A PLANET
[An SGC officer is helping O'Neill down a sandy slope toward the Gate.
Carter and Teal'c are already near the Gate.]
O'NEILL
Dial the Gate! Dial it now!
[Carter runs to dial the DHD as Teal'c runs towards O'Neill and the
officer.]
OFFICER
I swear, Sir, I thought they wanted to smoke a peace pipe.
[As Teal'c joins the officer in helping O'Neill, a swarm of natives
appear on the hills surrounding the valley where the Stargate sits,
yelling and carrying spears and dart guns. The natives descend in
pursuit.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Morning, Sergeant.
SGT. DAVIS
Morning, Sir.
HAMMOND
When is SG-1 due back?
SGT. DAVIS
Hour and 22 minutes from now, Sir.
HAMMOND
When they get back, tell Major Carter I have a message.
SGT. DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
[Suddenly the Gate activates and the alarms go off.]
SGT. DAVIS
Incoming wormhole.
[Davis sits down at the computer as Hammond comes to stand behind him.]
SGT. DAVIS
Receiving SG-1's identification code. It's a code red, Sir. Looks
like they're under fire.
[Hammond picks up a handset on the wall.]
HAMMOND
(into the handset)
Defense unit and medical team to the Gate room.
SGT. DAVIS
Opening the iris.
[Hammond heads down to the Gate room. He follows a couple of armed
personnel into the Gate room just as SG-1 walks through the Gate. A
spear flies through behind SG-1 and lands at the General's feet. He
reaches down to pick it up. He looks up to see O'Neill being helped by
Teal'c as they head past him toward the infirmary.]
O'NEILL
Next.
[Hammond approaches Major Carter and the other member of SG-1 on the
ramp. The officer pulls a dart out of his leg as a medic approaches.
Carter pulls another dart out of his shoulder as he sits down heavily
on the ramp.]
OFFICER
I've been shot.
[Hammond puts down the spear and walks up the ramp.]
OFFICER
(speech becoming slurred)
Some sort of tranquilizers...
[As the officer passes out, the medic checks his pulse and Carter looks
on in disgust.]
MEDIC
Steady pulse. He's just unconscious, Sir.
[Carter stands up, holding the dart and approaches Hammond.]
CARTER
I'd classify P2X-374 as unfriendly, Sir. Fairly primitive from the
looks of it.
HAMMOND
I presume Captain Hagman will need to be reassigned?
CARTER
I'd say so, Sir.
HAMMOND
We'll debrief in one hour. Dismissed. Oh, Major, I got a call this
morning from Area 51. It's done.
[Hammond returns up the ramp. Carter mouths the word Wow and heads out
of the Gate room.]
FADE OUT--END OF TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--OFFICE
[Jonas now occupies Daniel's lab. The TV is tuned to the weather
channel and he is listening to classical music while reading and eating
grapes. Carter approaches slowly, looking around the lab and smiling.]
CARTER
Jonas.
JONAS
Major. How is Colonel O'Neill?
CARTER
He's got a partially torn ligament in his knee. He'll be okay.
JONAS
Hmm. Captain Hagman?
CARTER
He'll make a full recovery.
JONAS
What's that make...eight now?
CARTER
Nine, if you count the two hours Capt. Mathison lasted.
JONAS
(referring to the book he is reading)
So there's no need for ancient Babylonian?
CARTER
Not exactly. You think you can spare a few hours?
JONAS
Sure. For what?
CARTER
Well, you've been here three months, General Hammond thought you
might finally like to leave the base.
JONAS
(smiling)
Yes. That would be great. Where we goin'?
CARTER
Nevada.
JONAS
Oh...clear skies...73 degrees.
CARTER
There are at least 500 other channels, you know.
JONAS
But this one...this one is fantastic. I mean you have...all of your
weather from all over your planet right here. Even a long-range
forecast. It's like...predicting the future.
CARTER
There is some science involved.
JONAS
I know. What's in Nevada?
CARTER
You like surprises?
JONAS
Sure, I love'em.
[Carter smiles and turns to leave.]
JONAS
Hey, Major...
[Carter stops and turns to face him.]
JONAS
How do I know what color to wear?
[Carter smiles and leaves.]
CARTER
(yelling back as she leaves)
We call each other every morning...
INT--AREA 51 HANGAR
[SG-1 and Jonas enter. They walk toward an aircraft and Carter is
approached by Dr. Larry Murphy.]
DR. MURPHY
Major, I thought you'd like to see the prototype as soon as it was
completed.
CARTER
Wow...you're way ahead of schedule.
[O'Neill opens the craft's cockpit and begins to climb in. Jonas climbs
the access stairs after him.]
JONAS
Very impressive.
DR. MURPHY
Thank you.
[O'Neill goes to sit in the aircraft.]
O'NEILL
Oh, n-no, n-n-n-no, no.
DR. MURPHY
Uh, I'm sorry?
CARTER
Dr. Larry Murphy...Colonel Jack O'Neill.
[Carter points to Teal'c who is studying the craft's undercarriage.]
CARTER
This is Teal'c and this is Jonas Quinn...the man responsible for
introducing us to the Naquadria.
[Jonas waves.]
DR. MURPHY
Pleasure to meet you.
O'NEILL
In case there was some doubt about what I was just saying...No.
[O'Neill drops into the aircraft's front seat.]
DR. MURPHY
Um, I'm sorry, to what exactly?
TEAL'C
O'Neill believes you are going to request that we test fly this
aircraft.
DR. MURPHY
Oh, yeah, uh, of course. Sir, I wasn't around for it, but we're all
quite familiar with your experience with the X-302's predecessor.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Are ya now...really?
DR. MURPHY
Well, Sir, I can tell you that this is a...this is a very different
ship.
CARTER
Sir, the X-301 was a modified glider. Now, while many of the 302's
systems were retroengineered from Goa'uld technology, it is entirely
human built.
O'NEILL
So was the Titanic.
CARTER
Sir, this could be the most important breakthrough for Earth since
the discovery of the Stargate.
JONAS
Why's that?
DR. MURPHY
It's got four different sets of engines...air breathing jets,
modified aerospikes for high altitude and a rocket booster.
JONAS
You said four, right?
CARTER
The fourth engine is a hyperspace window generator.
TEAL'C
Even Goa'uld gliders are not capable of entering hyperspace.
CARTER
That's because they're too small to carry the Goa'uld version of the
generator.
DR. MURPHY
Ours are much more compact.
CARTER
Because of the Naquadria. Jonas, this was all made possible because
of you.
DR. MURPHY
It's still a few weeks away from a practical test, but all
preliminary indications look good.
CARTER
If this performs the way it was designed to, the X-302 will be the
first human-built space craft capable of interstellar travel.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
CHECKOV
The deal made by our governments, General...
HAMMOND
I'm aware of every aspect of the arrangement, Colonel.
[O'Neill walks by the door, notices Checkov and tries to back out, but
Hammond sees him.]
HAMMOND
Ah, Jack...come in.
[O'Neill enters the office.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, you know Colonel Checkov, the Russian envoy to the SGC.
O'NEILL
We've...met.
HAMMOND
Colonel Checkov feels that as a symbol of our joint efforts, a
Russian officer should be assigned to join SG-1.
O'NEILL
Over my rotting corpse, Sir.
HAMMOND
Colonel...
O'NEILL
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
HAMMOND
I said I would discuss it with you and that I was sure you would
give it some careful thought.
O'NEILL
And that I will, General, but I'm still pretty sure I'll say...'bite
me'.
HAMMOND
(to Checkov)
Colonel, would you excuse us?
CHECKOV
General.
[As Checkov leaves the office, O'Neill turns to him.]
O'NEILL
So sorry.
[O'Neill walks over and takes a seat. Hammond is now seated as well.]
O'NEILL
I'm sorry, General, you know I mean no disrespect toward you.
HAMMOND
I know. I probably should have reprimanded you in front of the
Colonel, but I happen to agree with your sentiments in this case.
O'NEILL
Who decided every team that goes through the Gate has to have four
people?
HAMMOND
No one says they do, but Daniel Jackson provided SG-1 with
invaluable knowledge, linguistic skills and, in my opinion, a very
beneficial viewpoint. One I think is important enough to try and
replace.
O'NEILL
But not with a Russian!
HAMMOND
I agree, but my patience is starting to wear thin on this matter. I
think I've given you a great deal of latitude lately, given the
situation.
O'NEILL
Sir...
HAMMOND
Jack...you're off the mission list anyway until that knee fully
heals. Use the time to try and get some perspective. Find someone
qualified you can work with. I'll have all available personnel files
forwarded to you. Dismissed.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
[O'Neill rises and limps out of Hammond's office.]
INT--SAM'S LAB
[Carter is writing in a notebook when Jonas enters.]
JONAS
Major...
CARTER
Yeah?
JONAS
I realized I never actually thanked you for letting me see the
X-302.
CARTER
Ah, well, General Hammond ordered me to invite you.
JONAS
Oh. I'm glad the Naquadria is going to be useful.
CARTER
Yeah, looks that way.
JONAS
Can I see the plans for it?
CARTER
Yeah...uh, General Hammond says I should give you anything you want
regarding the Naquadria research, so...
[She hands him a large notebook.]
JONAS
He's a man of his word.
CARTER
I doubt it'll mean much to you without an understanding of our
science and engineering.
JONAS
Maybe you can recommend some related reading.
CARTER
Yeah, sure...I'll, uh, type up a list.
JONAS
Great. Thanks.
[Jonas begins to walk out, then turns back to Carter.]
JONAS
You know, Major...I'm as physically fit as anybody on this base and
I've committed to memory almost all of Doctor Jackson's work...
CARTER
Everything?
JONAS
According to the tests Doctor Fraiser administered, I have the
ability to learn much quicker than the average human.
CARTER
All very interesting information, but...
JONAS
I wanna join you. Explore other planets, discover new worlds, new
cultures, help rid the galaxy of the Goa'uld.
CARTER
I get the picture.
JONAS
I can't stay here on this base the rest of my life. I can't go back
to my planet. They don't realize the threat that's out there. I can
help them by helping you. I can also help finish what Doctor Jackson
started.
CARTER
Jonas. I understand why you want to join SG-1, and I'm sorry but...I
just don't see it happening.
[Jonas nods, smiles, salutes, taps this notebook she gave him, waves
and leaves.]
INT--SGC GYM
[Teal and Jonas are sparring on a cushioned mat. Jonas is wearing
head-gear, Teal'c is not.]
JONAS
He trusts you.
TEAL'C
I believe it is you, he must learn to trust.
[Teal'c tags Jonas and knocks him down. Jonas pops back up
immediately.]
JONAS
How can he learn to trust me if he won't even speak to me? You know?
He holds me responsible for what happened to Doctor Jackson.
TEAL'C
I believe you are correct.
[Teal'c tags Jonas again, knocking him down. Jonas pops up again.]
JONAS
How can I even begin to make up for it if he won't give me the
chance?
[Teal'c lays Jonas out a third time...again, he pops right back up.]
JONAS
Is this really a sport on this planet?
TEAL'C
Are you injured, Jonas Quinn?
JONAS
It'll take more than that. I'll tell you what...if I knock you
down...you gotta talk to Colonel O'Neill for me.
[Teal'c nods consent.]
JONAS
OK.
[Teal'c drops Jonas a fourth time and Jonas pops up again.]
JONAS
I'm OK... I wasn't ready...I'm ready now.
INT--SGC COMMISARY
[O'Neill is sitting at a table looking through file folders. Teal'c
joins O'Neill at the table with a tray full of food.]
O'NEILL
Little snack? I'm tellin' you, the universities of this great nation
are getting a little lax in their admissions.
TEAL'C
To whom are you referring, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
I can be as diplomatic and open minded as anyone...
[Teal'c raises his brow.]
O'NEILL
Hammond is insisting SG-1 needs a sociopolitical nerd to offset our
overwhelming coolness.
TEAL'C
Have you considered Jonas Quinn?
O'NEILL
Now I know you've been practicing, but I still can't tell...is that
a joke?
TEAL'C
He wishes to join the fight against the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
He's an Al...ien. He's an alien. The point is, I don't think we need
someone else on the team. You, Carter and I can handle things just
fine.
TEAL'C
You learned to trust me, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
That's different.
TEAL'C
I do not believe it is. Like me, Jonas Quinn may be an alien to this
world, but he has vowed to commit himself to the cause of the
Tau'ri.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean I want him watching my back in battle,
OK?
[Alarms begin blaring.]
VOICE OVER INTERCOM
Unscheduled incoming traveler.
[O'Neill and Teal'c rise to leave the commisary.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE GATE ROOM
[Brata'c and Hammond are exiting the Gate room just as Teal'c, O'Neill
and Carter arrive.]
O'NEILL
Bra'tac. What's up?
TEAL'C
Tek ma te, Master Bra'tac.
BRA'TAC
I'm sorry I did not come sooner, Teal'c. Drey'auc is gravely ill.
[Teal'c looks to Hammond.]
HAMMOND
No need to ask. Go.
INT--SGC ELEVATOR
[The doors to the elevator open. Carter and Jonas enter the elevator as
others exit. Carter pushes the button to close the door.]
JONAS
I didn't know he had a wife.
CARTER
Yeah, and a son, Rya'c. They were banished from their home on Chulak
when Teal'c defected. At one point Apophis actually brainwashed
Rya'c and tried to use him against us. Bra'tac's been looking out
for them ever since.
JONAS
So why didn't Teal'c just bring 'em here?
[The elevator doors open, Carter and Jonas exit and begin walking down
a corridor.]
CARTER
Well, Drey'auc wanted to stay with her own people if possible and
Teal'c was away on missions most of the time anyway. He tries to get
home as often as he can, but it's not easy for him.
JONAS
You'd never know, would you?
CARTER
Yeah, well, Teal'c's not exactly an open book.
JONAS
Still, I'm usually much better at reading people.
CHECKOV
Major!
[Colonel Checkov comes down the corridor behind them.]
CHECKOV
Why was I not informed about the X-302?
JONAS
For example, it might not be that obvious to everyone, but this man
is actually very upset.
[Carter nods.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
How did you find out about the X-302, Colonel?
CHECKOV
That is not the issue. Article 3A clearly states...
HAMMOND
The X-302 has nothing to do with the Stargate.
CHECKOV
The Naquadria being used to power the hyperspace window generator
was procured...
[Alarms begin blaring.]
VOICE OVER INTERCOM
Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
CARTER
What now?
HAMMOND
I'll take anything over this...
[Hammond and Carter leave the office. Checkov looks at Jonas, who
smiles at him.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Hmmond enter the Control Room via the stairs.]
SGT. DAVIS
We're not receiving an IDC, Sir. In fact, there's nothing, Sir.
[Carter sits at one of the monitors as O'Neill enters the room.]
O'NEILL
What's up?
CARTER
Apparently... nothing.
O'NEILL
Nothing?
CARTER
So it would seem.
O'NEILL
That's a twist.
CARTER
Gate's functioning properly. We're definitely looking at an incoming
wormhole.
HAMMOND
But nothing is incoming?
CARTER
As far as I can tell.
O'NEILL
The Goa'uld used that tactic before.
CARTER
To block our escape while they attacked in ships, yeah.
SGT. DAVIS
Nothing from deep space watch either.
CARTER
This doesn't make any sense. In order to keep a wormhole open, you
have to send something through...a radio signal, anything. We're
getting...nothing.
HAMMOND
Figure it out, Major. I'll call the President.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
[Hammond leaves.]
O'NEILL
Don't look at me...I got nothing.
[O'Neill leaves.]
EXT--CHULAK
BRA'TAC
As you see, conditions are harsh, but they have been safe here.
[Teal'c and Bra'tac are walking through a Jaffa camp as they converse.]
TEAL'C
They must be moved to the new outpost built by the Tau'ri. All Jaffa
who support our cause are welcome there.
BRA'TAC
Drey'auc is in no state to be moved now.
TEAL'C
Why did you wait?
BRA'TAC
As it is, I brought you here against her wishes.
TEAL'C
She has always been proud.
[A Jaffa bumps into Teal'c as he walks past. Teal'c pauses and both he
and Bra'tac look back at the Jaffa, but say nothing.]
BRA'TAC
She refused to accept the new symbiote.
TEAL'C
Was one procured?
BRA'TAC
No. She did not wish us to sacrifice the life of another Jaffa to
save her own, even one who still foolishly worships the false gods.
We would all chose the same fate.
TEAL'C
In the past...
BRA'TAC
It is not the past, my friend. The descent we have bred has brought
about many changes. The Goa'uld no longer trust the Jaffa priests
with their young as they once did...
[Rya'c emerges from a tent and glares at his father. Teal'c turns
towards him]
TEAL'C
Rya'c!
RYA'C
You dare show your face here? She is dead...because of you.
[Rya'c shoves Teal'c as he walks past him, obviously upset. Teal'c is
stunned into silence.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
HAMMOND
Could it be a malfunction of some kind?
CARTER
It's possible, Sir, but highly unlikely. Chances are somebody dialed
Earth from an offworld Gate.
O'NEILL
Wrong number?
CARTER
Well, normally the Gate shuts down automatically after a short
period of time if nothing's entering the event horizon from the
out-going location.
O'NEILL
So...what do we do?
CARTER
We wait. To my knowledge no one's been able to sustain a wormhole
for longer than 38 minutes.
HAMMOND
Could whoever's behind this redial our Gate repeatedly just to keep
us from using it?
CARTER
I've programmed the computer to dial the Alpha site immediately
after the incoming wormhole expires, just in case. We'll be able to
recall our offworld teams and hopefully contact someone who can
help.
[Carter, O'Neill and Hammond watch the clock on the computer as it
approaches and passes the 38 minute mark.]
HAMMOND
It's still on.
CARTER
38 minutes, give or take a few seconds.
[O'Neill turns to watch the clock again for several seconds.]
O'NEILL
How many is a few?
CARTER
OK, now we have a problem.
INT--TENT ON CHULAK
[Teal'c enters the tent where Drey'auc lies. He kneels beside the cot
and pulls back the cloth that is covering her face. He gazes on her
face and is overcome by grief.]
EXT--CHULAK
[Teal'c approaches Rya'c who is sitting in a sparsely wooded area.]
RYA'C
She believed in you...in the fight you have chosen.
TEAL'C
As you once did.
RYA'C
How long were we to live like this? Are we all to die like she did?
TEAL'C
Nothing has changed. The Goa'uld can be defeated.
RYA'C
As long as we must carry symbiotes, we will depend on the Goa'uld
for our lives.
TEAL'C
We will find a way to be free.
[Rya'c stands and faces his father...growing angrier.]
RYA'C
My mother will never know this freedom you speak of. She had no
choice. You brought this upon her. You chose for the both of us.
[Rya'c bends down and picks up a staff weapon and points it at Teal'c.]
RYA'C
Now, as any warrior would, I choose to avenge her death.
[Rya'c charges the staff weapon and points it at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Everything I have done, I have done for you.
RYA'C
Then I am ashamed...for you have done nothing but bring pain and
misery and above all, false hope, to countless Jaffa.
TEAL'C
Then fire your weapon.
[Rya'c hits Teal'c across the face several times with the staff weapon.
He hits him in the stomach, doubling Teal'c over. Teal'c does nothing
to retaliate, but allows Rya'c take out his rage and frustration on
him.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Lt. Simmons is working at a terminal as Carter enters the room.]
LT. SIMMONS
Major...there's a rise in power being retained by the Gate's
internal capacitors of .1%.
CARTER
Well, while there's an open wormhole, the value tends to fluctuate
by at least that much anyway.
LT. SIMMONS
Not for the last 12 minutes, it hasn't.
CARTER
Go to Gate diagnostic screen four.
LT. SIMMONS
Normal...no incoming energy readings.
CARTER
Increase sensitivity by 50%.
[A few blips appear on the computer graph.]
CARTER
What was that?
LT. SIMMONS
Could be interference in the line between the Gate and computer.
CARTER
There it is again. Increase sensitivity by 200%.
LT. SIMMONS
That's well within the accepted margin of error for the sensors.
CARTER
I know, try it anyway.
[A pattern of blips appears on the computer graph.]
CARTER
I admit it's a pretty small anomaly, but it could be contributing to
the power build up in the Gate.
LT. SIMMONS
But, uh...
CARTER
Errors are random, Lt. Whatever this is, it has a distinct pattern.
LT. SIMMONS
Right.
EXT--CHULAK FOREST
[Rya'c has knocked Teal'c to the ground. Teal'c still does not respond
to Rya'c assault, although his face is bloddy. Teal'c slowly rises.]
RYA'C
(yelling)
Fight! Or do you not consider me a worthy opponent?
[Rya'c maneuvers the staff weapon, ready to deal Teal'c another blow,
but he is stopped as Bra'tac steps in and grabs the staff weapon.]
BRA'TAC
You should be glad he does not, for if he did, he would snap you in
half. You have become skilled, Rya'c, but a true Jaffa warrior does
not let grief cloud his judgement.
RYA'C
I choose my opponent as foolishly as he chose his.
BRA'TAC
Teal'c chose your mother's fate no more than he chose his own. We
are all victims of the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
No, Master Bra'tac, Rya'c is correct. I have failed both he and his
mother.
BRA'TAC
The boy passes judgment without having fought a single battle...hmm?
Fighting a war that appears unwinnable does not make ones cause less
noble.
RYA'C
He cares more for dying than for his own flesh and blood.
BRA'TAC
So must all Jaffa, if any of us are ever to taste freedom.
[Bra'tac disengages the staff weapon and hands it back to Rya'c who
snatches it from him and stalks away, watched by his father.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Lt. Simmons is seated at the same terminal as previously, watching the
chart fluctuations.]
CARTER
We've detected an energy build up within the Gate. It's being
transmitted through the incoming wormhole. We didn't notice it
before because our sensors aren't calibrated to measure something
this small.
HAMMOND
The iris appears to be holding.
CARTER
Yes, Sir. It's likely slowing the energy transfer significantly, but
it's not stopping it completely.
O'NEILL
(hesitantly)
Doesn't sound so bad.
CARTER
Actually Sir, it is. The Gate itself is one giant superconductor
capable of absorbing huge amounts of energy. Now, if that capacity
is eventually exceeded, the Naquadah that the Stargate's made up of
will become charged and could eventually explode.
O'NEILL
How long?
CARTER
A few days, maybe less...we're calculating it right now.
HAMMOND
Is there any good news?
[Someone off camera hands Carter a lap top. She shakes her head
negatively.]
CARTER
Just bad and worse, Sir. We're talking about a blast two to three
thousand megatons.
HAMMOND
Enough to take out Colorado.
CARTER
The resulting environmental effects could destroy all life on Earth.
O'NEILL
There's worse?
CARTER
We have no idea how to stop it.
EXT--CHULAK--NIGHTIME
[Teal'c lights Drey'auc's funeral pyre, as a number of Jaffa watch.]
TEAL'C
Shel Mak. Shel Assah.
[Teal'c watches the fire for a time. He spots Rya'c in the crowd. Their
eyes meet and Rya'c turns to leave. Teal'c starts to follow, but is
stopped by Bra'tac.]
BRA'TAC
Let him mourn.
TEAL'C
He has grown to hate me.
BRA'TAC
He does not. Nor does he truly believe our cause is futile. Drey'auc
would not allow it.
TEAL'C
Why does he speak as he does.
BRA'TAC
Self-doubt. Since the day Apophis brainwashed him, he has believed
his own mind is weak.
TEAL'C
It is not true.
BRA'TAC
You were no different at his age. After the death of your father at
the hands of Cronus, fear almost consumed you. Like Rya'c, it was
deSire for vengeance that gave you strength.
TEAL'C
Rya'c misplaces his blame.
BRA'TAC
He directs his malice toward you because he believes you doubt him
as much as he doubts himself.
TEAL'C
Why would he believe such a thing?
BRA'TAC
Because you are his father and you have not told him otherwise.
[Teal'c turns back to the fire for a time. Later he approaches Rya'c
who is sitting on the steps at the base of the Stargate. Teal'c sits
beside him.]
TEAL'C
Not...so long ago, I was captured in battle and Apophis took control
of my mind. He made me believe that... I was once again his loyal
first prime. And I turned on my friends who trusted me. Were it not
for Bra'tac and the right of MalSharran, I would have
died...believing that Apophis was my god. Whether you believe in me
or what I have chosen to do does not change the fact that I have
never doubted your heart, Rya'c. You need never win back my trust,
my son, for you have never lost it.
[Both are emotional, turn to each other and hug.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Lt. Simmons is walking with another officer down a corridor toward the
Gate room.]
OFFICER
Shouldn't we be cutting all power to the Gate?
LT. SIMMONS
Won't do any good. Incoming wormholes draw their energy from the
offworld source. Major Carter still wants to be able to monitor the
Gate through the feedback system.
[Sgt. Siler is at the base of the ramp in the Gate room as Lt. Simmons
and the other officer pass.]
SGT. SILER
(to technician on the ramp)
We can't use the Russian Gate because we can't dial out of another
Gate when there's already an established incoming wormhole to Earth.
[Jonas walks into the Gate room at that time and looks around at the
chaos. He is holding some books and turns to gaze up into the control
room where Carter is leaning over a computer terminal talking with two
female technicians.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
FEMALE OFFICER
Energy build up has reached 18%.
CARTER
There has to be a way to drain the capacitors...
VOICE BEHIND SAM
Still as sexy as ever, I see.
[Carter turns to see Dr. McKay stroll into the room.]
CARTER
What are you doing here?
MCKAY
Well, there's no point in building Naquadah reactors for Russia if
there isn't going to be a Russia, is there? The Pentagon thought
you, uh, might need some help.
CARTER
Not from you.
MCKAY
Oh, OK. Well, then I'll get a coffee and a doughnut and wait for the
big bang.
[McKay smiles smugly and walks past Carter]
CARTER
(as McKay leaves, whispering to herself)
That's just what I needed.
SGT. DAVIS
Major.
[He hands her a handset.]
CARTER
(into the handset)
Carter.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
CHECKOV
This wouldn't be a problem if you had a working alien ship.
O'NEILL
(rubbing his sore knee)
Hey! I didn't wreck it...the Goa'uld did. And we barely escaped with
our lives, thank you.
CHECKOV
What good is being a part of this so-called protected planets treaty
if you can't even reach the Asgard when we're being attacked?
[Carter enters.]
CARTER
Excuse me, Sirs. I just got off the phone with Doctor Murphy at Area
51. He says he can have the X-302 ready to go in six hours.
O'NEILL
I thought it was weeks away from a flight test.
CARTER
Sir, we've tried everything else we can think of. Our only chance is
if we can contact the Asgard. I'd like to volunteer, Sir.
[Hammond nods consent.]
O'NEILL
I'll go too, Sir.
HAMMOND
You sure you're up for it, Colonel? O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
[O'Neill slaps his knee and rises.]
HAMMOND
I'll have transport prepped and ready in twenty minutes.
EXT--CHULAK
[Teal'c, Bra'tac and Rya'c exit a tent and grab staff weapons. The look
up to see a Goa'uld cargo ship descending and landing. Teal'c, Bra'tac
and Rya'c walk towards the craft, followed by a number of Jaffa. A
Jaffa emerges from the craft and greets Teal'c, Bra'tac and Rya'c.]
TEAL'C
Shaq'rel.
SHAQ'REL
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
It has been too long, old friend.
SHAQ'REL
It is fortunate you are here. I have brought word to Master Bra'tac
so that he might warn you.
TEAL'C
Of what?
SHAQ'REL
The Tau'ri are in danger. They are under attack from Anubis.
INT--AREA 51 HANGAR
[Carter and O'Neill arrive via HumVee. Both are wearing flight suits.
They talk with Dr. Murphy as they walk to the X-302 and climb in the
cockpit.]
DR. MURPHY
I assume you were briefed on the way here?
O'NEILL
Briefly.
DR. MURPHY
The target is Abydos, that being the closest planet with a Stargate.
And you do know that out theoretical simulations for opening a
hyperspace window were done in space?
CARTER
We know we have to leave the atmosphere.
O'NEILL
We have to leave the ground first.
DR. MURPHY
It'll fly, Colonel. I bet my life on it.
O'NEILL
Wanna come with?
DR. MURPHY
Love to...but I'm needed here.
O'NEILL
Yes...yes you are.
CARTER
(as they are climbing into the cockpit)
You know, Sir, even if we do manage to contact the Asgard, there's a
chance they won't be able to help us.
O'NEILL
What's your point, Carter?
CARTER
Guess I don't have one, beyond that, Sir.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Jonas is wandering around, reading a book and looking at the numerous
technicians in the room. Hammond enters with McKay.]
HAMMOND
(to McKay)
You're missing the point, Doctor.
[Jonas approaches the pair.]
JONAS
General, can I have a minute?
HAMMOND
I wish I had one. Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill are about to take
off.
JONAS
That's what this is about, Sir.
HAMMOND
What do you mean?
JONAS
Look, I'm no scientist, but I have studied all of the Goa'uld
research done on Naquadriah and as you know, Major Carter allowed me
to see the specifications on the X-302...
HAMMOND
And?
JONAS
It's not going to work.
MCKAY
Really? That's just what I was saying. Who are you?
JONAS
Jonas Quinn.
MCKAY
Oh, the alien with the whacky Naquadah...
JONAS
Naquadriah...you are?
MCKAY
McKay. Scientist. Earth.
JONAS
General...the instability of the Naquadriah increases exponentially
as you attempt to extract more energy out of it.
MCKAY
(looking at the notebook Jonas has been referring to)
Oh, this is even worse than I thought.
JONAS
If you allow this test to proceed, Sir...
HAMMOND
Son, this is not just a test. If the X-302 fails, this planet will
be destroyed.
JONAS
I understand your position, Sir.
HAMMOND
It's not just my position. You stand to suffer the consequences
along with everyone else. Now, if either of you have a more prudent
suggestion on halting this crisis, I'm willing to hear it.
Otherwise, I suggest we all go downstairs, cross our fingers and
hope Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill can reach help.
[Hammond heads down the stairs. Jonas looks after him momentarily, then
turns to McKay with a questioning look.]
JONAS
Cross our fingers?
MCKAY
It's a superstitious way some humans have of expressing their deSire
for good luck.
JONAS
Really?
MCKAY
(demonstrating the crossed fingers as he walks by Jonas)
Ridiculous, huh?
[Jonas takes back his notebook as McKay passes.]
EXT--AREA 51
[The X-302 begins to taxi out to the runway.]
CARTER
Navigation.
O'NEILL
Check.
CARTER
Oxygen, pressure, temperature control.
O'NEILL
All check.
CARTER
Inertial dampeners.
O'NEILL
Cool...and check.
CARTER
Engines.
O'NEILL
All check. Phasers?
CARTER
Sorry, Sir. All systems operational.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas walks into the room. Sgt. Davis and McKay are seated, with
Hammond standing behind.]
O'NEILL
(over the intercom)
It's too bad we can't drive across the galaxy...this thing handles
like a Cadillac on the ground.
HAMMOND
(into microphone)
Colonel, Major, this is Hammond. Jonas Quinn has voiced some concern
about this mission specifically regarding the instability of the
Naquadriah.
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
CARTER
Sir, the simulations we ran anticipated every conceivable scenario.
O'NEILL
You know, Carter, it's the inconceivable ones I'm concerned about.
CARTER
The X-302 has hundreds of safety mechanisms to compensate for
anything that can go wrong. Arming ejection system.
[Carter grins as she looks forward towards O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
That's good...that's good, that's funny.
CARTER
Mission command...all systems go from Abydos One.
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Copy that, Abydos One. Good luck.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas and Hammond both look concerned.]
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
O'NEILL
Well...here we go.
[The X-302 takes off and begins to climb.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas is pacing back and forth as Sgt. Davis, McKay and Hammond look
to the upper screens.]
CARTER
We have lift off.
O'NEILL
Climbing...
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
O'NEILL
Velocity approaching Mach two.
CARTER
10,000 meters.
O'NEILL
Mach three.
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Mission command, over. Looks good from here, Abydos One.
O'NEILL
Abydos One, over.
EXT--CHULAK STARGATE
[Teal'c is trying to dial Earth but is unsuccessful. Bra'tac, Shaq'rel
and Ry'ac look on.]
SHAQ'REL
Anubis has a weapon that uses one Stargate to destroy another and if
my information is correct, the attack has already begun.
BRA'TAC
We cannot warn them.
SHAQ'REL
That is why I brought a ship.
TEAL'C
If the attack has already begun, a warning will do little good. We
must find a way to stop it before it is too late.
SHAQ'REL
We do not know the location of this weapon.
BRA'TAC
Anubis has grown powerful, but still only defends a small handful of
planets. If one of those Stargates also cannot be contacted...
TEAL'C
It is most likely the origin of the attack.
BRA'TAC
Let us hope it is one of the planets to which I can remember the
sequence.
[Bra'tac starts dialing the DHD.]
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
CARTER
Preparing for main rocket engine burn.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas and Hammond both look very concerned, and share a look of
worry.]
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Roger that, Abydos. We'll re-establish contact on Satcom 3 after you
exit the atmosphere.
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
O'NEILL
Engaging rocket engine.
[The 302 climbs out of the atmosphere.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas, Hammond, Sgt. Siler and Mckay all look concerned, awaiting
O'Neill's next words.]
O'NEILL
Mission Command, this is Abydos One, do you read?
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Loud and clear, Abydos One.
O'NEILL
Altitude, 500 kilometers and rising.
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
O'NEILL
Velocity, 40,000 kilometers per hour.
CARTER
I'm entering the coordinates in the hyperspace generator.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Roger that, Abydos One.
HAMMOND
(into microphone)
God's speed Colonel, Major, from all of us.
[Hammond smiles at Jonas who is standing beside him, crossing his index
fingers--one on each hand.]
INT--X-302 INTERIOR
O'NEILL
Thank you, Sir.
O'NEILL
Let's do this.
CARTER
Engaging hyperspace window.
[A colorful vortex appears in front of the 302. Suddenly, master alarms
go off. The 302 veers out of the path of the hyperspace window.]
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Abydos One, this is mission command, do you read? We are still
receiving your radio signal.
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
I don't know, Sir.
O'NEILL
Mission Command, we missed the window.
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Abydos One, please explain.
CARTER
The autopilot engaged and we veered off course at the last second,
Mission Command. Should we try again?
MISSION COMMAND
(over speakers)
Negative, Abydos One, return to base for further evaluation. Mission
failure.
O'NEILL
I hate hearing that.
INT--SGC
[O'Neill and Carter walk into the Briefing Room. The table is full of
monitors, still counting up the length of time that the Gate has been
open.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, Major, I'm glad to see you're OK.
O'NEILL
For the moment, Sir.
CARTER
They're still analyzing the flight data recorder, but it looks like
a 605-3 error.
HAMMOND
Forgive me?
O'NEILL
It's the one after 605-2, Sir.
CARTER
The X-302 couldn't get a lock on its destination once the window was
open so it auto-aborted. It's one of the built in safety features.
MCKAY
What went wrong?
CARTER
The hyperspace window was unstable. We thought we'd compensated for
the energy fluctuations emitted by the Naquadriah, but apparently
not.
JONAS
I don't think you can.
O'NEILL
Apparently, Carter and I could have been torn...asunder.
CARTER
The possibility of that was remote, Sir.
MCKAY
More likely, is you just would have been transported to an unknown
location with limited fuel, oxygen and no way of getting back.
HAMMOND
Can this problem be resolved?
CARTER
Sir, we don't even understand why the problem exists, yet.
MCKAY
You're lucky. There's no telling how much damage an unstable
hyperspace window could have caused.
[Carter smiles at McKay.]
HAMMOND
The bottom line is, we're on our own.
[Carter nods at Hammond and glares at McKay.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[O'Neill walks in to find Carter working alone at her bench.]
O'NEILL
Hey, how come you're not downstairs with the rest of the eggheads?
Not that you're...an egghead...
[Carter looks at him, brows raised.]
O'NEILL
Well, you are...actually...but in a good way.
CARTER
I couldn't think down there...they all kept looking at me for the
answer.
O'NEILL
Well, you do have a penchant for pulling brilliant ideas out of your
butt.
[Carter gives him an incredulous look.]
O'NEILL
Head...out of your head...when we need them.
CARTER
Not this time.
O'NEILL
Well, you still got two days to work on it.
CARTER
Sir, I don't think I could solve this if I had a couple of years.
O'NEILL
Carter, am I sensing fear in your voice?
CARTER
Yes, actually, a lot of fear.
O'NEILL
Well, stop it! You're making me nervous.
CARTER
What about you, Sir? Any ideas? I mean, sometimes you have a way of
seeing things at...at their simplest.
O'NEILL
Thank you. I'm gonna go eat some cake.
[O'Neill turns to leave.]
CARTER
I think I'll join you.
[Carter gets up to follow him and alarms start going off. Carter and
O'Neill race to the Gate room, as the lights fail.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
SGT. DAVIS
We're experiencing a widespread loss of power, Sir.
INT--GATE ROOM
[Carter and O'Neill enter just as a holographic image of Anubis comes
through the Gate.]
ANUBIS
I am Anubis.
[O'Neill gives Carter a questioning look.]
CARTER
It looks like a hologram projection, Sir.
ANUBIS
Humans of the Tau'ri. Your end of days finally approaches. There
will be no mercy.
O'NEILL
Oh, come on...who talks like that?
CARTER
Sir, this is Asgard technology. He must have downloaded it from
Thor.
ANUBIS
You will bow to my awesome power. There is nothing that can stop the
destruction I bring upon you. Prepare to meet your doom.
[Anubis disappears.]
O'NEILL
Oh, please.
