   TEASER

   FADE IN

   EXT--PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING--DAY

   [Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are running towards the Stargate as they
   come under staff weapons fire. They quickly take cover.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     We're going to make it to the Gate but we're under fire. Teal'c has
     taken a hit.

   [She pauses to return fire and some of the attacking Jaffa go down.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     What's your situation?

   EXT--PLANET, CLEARING--DAY

   [Two Jaffa run into the clearing and are shot by O'Neill. Lying next to
   him is another man who has been shot in the leg.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Tyler's hit too and we're cut off so get the hell out of here.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     We can hold the Gate.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Negative.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     We're not leaving without you!

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Carter don't argue with me. Get reinforcements.

   EXT--PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING--DAY

   [More Jaffa are heading towards the Stargate as Carter, Teal'c and
   Daniel attempt to hold them off.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [A klaxon begins to sound as a wormhole opens.]

     SERGEANT
     Sir, receiving IDC, it's SG1.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The iris opens and Carter, Teal'c and Daniel slowly back into the Gate
   room.]

     CARTER
     Close the iris!

   [Hammond makes his way into the Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Report Major.

     CARTER
     We were attacked by several Jaffa. Lieutenant Tyler went down
     covering our six. Colonel O'Neill went back for him.

     TEAL'C
     Let us assemble a rescue team and return to the planet immediately
     General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     Hold on. Who's Lieutenant Tyler?

     DANIEL
     What do you mean, who's Lieutenant Tyler? He's a member of SG1.

     HAMMOND
     What?

     DANIEL
     You assigned him yourself last month Sir.

     CARTER
     Tyler, Sir, we've been training him for weeks. This was his third
     mission.

     HAMMOND
     Major, I have no idea what you're talking about.

   END OF TEASER

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Three Jaffa are patrolling through the woods. O'Neill and Tyler watch
   them pass.]

     O'NEILL
     We got to move, Lieutenant. Can you walk?

     TYLER
     I can try.

     O'NEILL
     Let's go.

   [He helps Tyler to his feet and they head away.]

   INT--GATE ROOM, SGC

     TEAL'C
     General Hammond, we must return to the planet immediately.

     HAMMOND
     No one's going anywhere until I find out exactly what happened.

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill and Lieutenant Tyler were cut off from the Gate. I
     already told you Sir.

     HAMMOND
     And I'm telling you I've never heard of this Lieutenant Tyler.

     DANIEL
     How can you say that?

     HAMMOND
     I think you should report to the Infirmary.

     CARTER
     Sir, there's nothing wrong with us.

     HAMMOND
     We'll leave that up to Dr Fraiser.

     DANIEL
     General, Jack is trapped on that planet.

     HAMMOND
     Sergeant.

   [An Airman walks up.]

     HAMMOND
     Escort them to the Infirmary.

     CARTER
     With or without reinforcements, we are going back Sir.

     HAMMOND
     The hell you are. Relinquish your weapons.

   [Neither Carter, Teal'c or Daniel make any move to do so.]

     HAMMOND
     Airmen!

   [The airmen in the Gate room quickly surround Carter, Teal'c and
   Daniel.]

     HAMMOND
     Major Carter I will authorised the use of force unless you
     relinquish those weapons immediately.

   [Carter hesitates, then reluctantly unclips her gun and allows it to be
   confiscated. Teal'c and Daniel also surrender their weapons.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [O'Neill is carrying Tyler over one shoulder. They enter the ruins of a
   building and O'Neill sets Tyler down.]

     O'NEILL
     You're heavier than you look.

     TYLER
     Sorry Sir.

     O'NEILL
     It's no problem.

   [Tyler shifts and is in obvious pain.]

     O'NEILL
     How's the leg?

     TYLER
     It's no problem.

   [There is a bleeding gash across his leg.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, right.

   [He gazes around the surrounding area.]

     TYLER
     What is this place?

     O'NEILL
     Well, I wouldn't buy a timeshare but it's, ah, defendable.

     TYLER
     Until Major Carter returns?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, Major Carter and a whole lot of her friends.

     TYLER
     Colonel, you could have made it to the Gate. You came back for me.

     O'NEILL
     What's your point?

     TYLER
     I guess I'm grateful.

     O'NEILL
     Well I wasn't going to let you die Lieutenant. It's like...a ton of
     paperwork.

     TYLER

     (confused)
     Paperwork.

     O'NEILL
     It's a joke. My way of deflecting attention from my own obvious
     heroism. You'll get used to it.

     TYLER

     (nodding)
     Oh right. I understand.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Hammond is looking out at the Stargate. Fraiser enters.]

     FRAISER
     General Hammond. Teal'c is going to be fine. It's a bad burn but his
     symbiote should take care of it. Any word from Colonel O'Neill?

     HAMMOND
     We've been trying to raise him using the MALP as a relay but
     apparently it's been disabled.

     FRAISER
     Well I've completed my preliminary exams of Major Carter, Teal'c and
     Daniel and so far I've found nothing wrong with them. I mean they're
     obviously agitated, but that's understandable given the
     circumstances.

     HAMMOND
     Doctor, three of my people have just come back from a mission
     talking about a Lieutenant who doesn't exist. You can't tell me
     there's nothing wrong with them.

     FRAISER
     I can't explain it sir.

     HAMMOND
     Some kind of hallucination?

     FRAISER
     Hallucinations aren't normally shared.

     HAMMOND
     There's never been a Tyler in this Command.

     FRAISER
     Yes Sir and we're still waiting for test results.

     HAMMOND
     In the meantime I want them quarantined in the Infirmary.

     FRAISER
     Already done that Sir as a precaution. But they did insist I ask
     what you're going to do about Colonel O'Neill.

     HAMMOND
     If SG1 has fallen under some kind of an alien influence, anyone I
     send back to the planet would be compromised as well. Until we know
     exactly what is going on, P7S 441 is off limits.

     FRAISER
     Yes Sir.

   [She walks away and Hammond returns to stare at the Gate.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are in the SGC's Infirmary.]

     CARTER

     (angrily)
     This is ridiculous, we should never have left the damned planet.

     TEAL'C
     You were ordered to do so by Colonel O'Neill.

     CARTER
     He could be dead by now for all we know.

     DANIEL
     It's not like there's anything we can do about. There are several,
     heavily armed men just outside that door.

     CARTER
     Well we have to do something.

     DANIEL
     Ok. Let's think this through. Why would General Hammond say he
     doesn't remember Lieutenant Tyler?

     CARTER
     I don't think he's just saying, I think he really doesn't remember.

     DANIEL
     How can that be? Yesterday we were all in the briefing room for two
     hours going over the mission.

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe General Hammond would lie to us.

     DANIEL
     So what, he's suffering from some kind of amnesia, or...?

     CARTER
     Well if that's the case, they're all suffering from it. I mean, Dr
     Fraiser didn't seem to remember him either.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps General Hammond is correct. Perhaps there is something wrong
     with us.

     DANIEL
     Ok, when I went through the Quantum Mirror on P3R 233 I came back to
     a base that looked just like this one. Everything was exactly the
     same except for no one knew who I was.

     CARTER
     Because the Daniel Jackson in that reality never joined the SGC.

     DANIEL
     Right. So what if this is a reality where Tyler never joined?
     Or...maybe he was killed in an earlier mission. Maybe he was never
     even born.

     CARTER
     I don't know Daniel. There was nothing on 441 that even remotely
     resembled a quantum mirror.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps the Stargate malfunctioned.

     CARTER
     Well we've never had any evidence to suggest the Gate can access a
     parallel universe.

     TEAL'C
     If Lieutenant Tyler does exist in this reality there would be a
     record of him in the Base computer.

     CARTER
     Yes. His personnel file.

   [She crosses to the computer and starts to type. The monitor displays
   an access denied message.]

     CARTER
     My access code isn't working. They must have decided we're a
     security risk and locked us out.

     DANIEL
     So you can't get in.

     CARTER
     I didn't say that.

   [She continues typing.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [O'Neill is taking an inventory of everything they have.]

     O'NEILL
     Where's your weapon Lieutenant.

     TYLER
     I'm sorry Sir, I dropped it when I got hit.

     O'NEILL
     Alright, we still got four mags, two clips, a little C4, some
     grenades and a launcher.

     TYLER
     Is that enough?

     O'NEILL
     It's a start.

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Carter is still working at the computer terminal.]

     CARTER
     There is no record of a Lieutenant Tyler on active duty at the SGC.

     DANIEL
     That's impossible.

     CARTER
     Even day pass visitors are logged in. There is no way he could have
     been on the Base and not in the computer. I configured a search for
     the name Tyler anywhere in the database. Nothing.

     DANIEL
     Well obviously someone is wrong here. Could it be us?

     CARTER
     I think we have to admit the possibility.

     TEAL'C
     In either case, O'Neill remains in danger.

     CARTER
     Wait a minute, this is weird. Somebody else configured an identical
     search less than an hour ago. Somebody outside the Base.

     DANIEL
     Someone outside the Base? How do you know that?

     CARTER

     Because it's not a Base ID, it's just a user number. 4574.
     (She brings up a list of data)
     Wow, he's been busy. Over the past two weeks he's accessed a number
     of secure files. Mission logs, briefings, personnel files.

     DANIEL
     Uh, whose personnel files?

     CARTER
     Ours.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

     O'NEILL
     Listen up. We've got a couple of MREs left but we're running low on
     water. I'm going to check the area. Keep the P-90.

   [He hands the gun to Tyler.]

     TYLER
     Wouldn't it be safer just to wait? Major Carter and the others
     should be coming soon.

     O'NEILL
     Well, the truth is they should have been here by now. Something must
     have happened.

     TYLER
     Are you saying they're not coming for us?

     O'NEILL
     Nope. I'm just saying it might take a little longer than we thought.

     TYLER
     What if they never made it back?

     O'NEILL
     Then General Hammond will send someone else.

     TYLER
     How do you know?

     O'NEILL
     Because, Lieutenant, we don't leave our people behind. You should
     know that.

     TYLER
     Yes Sir.

     O'NEILL

     Good. Stay off the radio.
     (He tosses it to Tyler)
     Keep the channel open. I'll give you three clicks when I'm on my way
     back, so don't shoot me.

     TYLER
     I won't.

   [O'Neill heads off and Tyler sets the gun and radio to one side.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [A group of technicians are working in the Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Sergeant?

     SERGEANT
     I'm sorry Sir. The second MALP was struck by zat fire shortly after
     reaching the planet.

     HAMMOND
     Launch the UAV.

     SERGEANT
     Yes Sir.

   [There is an alarm and a warning, before the UAV is launched through
   the open Stargate.]

     SERGEANT
     UAV is airborne and beginning search pattern.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [O'Neill is heading through the woods.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

     HAMMOND
     Try to raise Colonel O'Neill.

     SERGEANT
     SG niner, this is Stargate Command, please respond.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

     SERGEANT

     (over radio)
     SG niner, this is Stargate Command, please respond.

     O'NEILL

     (into his radio)
     We're still here, over.

   [He sees the UAV fly over head.]

     HAMMOND

     (over radio)
     This is General Hammond. What's your situation?

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

     O'NEILL

     (over radio)
     We could use some backup Sir. Tyler's immobile and there's Jaffa all
     over the damn place...

   [He is cut off and they lose the UAV's signal.]

     SERGEANT
     Sir, we lost the signal.

     HAMMOND
     We sit tight. Obviously he'd been affected by the same hallucination
     as the rest of SG1. It rules out sending a retrieval team until we
     know more.

     SERGEANT
     Well Sir if you like, we could try sending a second UAV.

   [Colonel Simmons enters the Control Room.]

     SIMMONS
     I don't know if that's a good idea General. Those things aren't
     cheap.

   [He hands Hammond a file.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel Simmons.

     SIMMONS

     (nodding at the file)
     I think you might want to take a look at that.

     HAMMOND
     My office.

   [They walk off.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE, SGC

   [Hammond and Simmons head into the office. Hammond drops the file onto
   his desk.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel I understand you've been ordered to investigate a security
     problem.

     SIMMONS
     Well Sir, when three members of your best team voices concerns about
     their imaginary friend, it does tend to raise some eyebrows. Your
     own report suggests that there might be some sort of mind control.

     HAMMOND
     I have people working on it.

     SIMMONS
     I'm sure you do, but we think an independent investigation is called
     for. I'm sure we'll have your full co-operation.

   [Hammond glances at the red phone on his desk.]

     SIMMONS
     You can use the red phone if you'd like Sir, but one day you're
     going to play that card once too often.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel I have an officer trapped offworld and there's nothing I can
     do for him until I get to the bottom of this.

     SIMMONS
     Well then Sir you should welcome my help.

   [Hammond looks frustrated.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Simmons is leafing through a file. Daniel enters the room.]

     SIMMONS
     Oh Doctor Jackson. Sit down.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     SIMMONS
     Well, I thought I'd give you an opportunity to explain what happened
     on that planet.

     DANIEL
     I...filed a report.

     SIMMONS
     Yes, you did. And a very interesting read it is. Full of amazing
     events and fictional characters. Sit down.

   [Daniel slowly takes his seat as Simmons turns on a tape recorder.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [An orderly is bagging the uniforms of the returned members of SG1.]

     FRAISER
     Wait a minute. Let me see that.

   [She takes the bag and rubs her hand over the plastic, noting a strange
   stain. A nurse enters the Infirmary.]

     NURSE
     Dr Fraiser? We got the blood work and DNA results. No anomalies
     detected.

     FRAISER
     Thank you. I found this residue on Teal'c's jacket. I want to have
     this analysed.

   [She gives the Nurse the bag.]

     NURSE
     Yes doctor.

   [The Nurse leaves. Fraiser suddenly experiences a flash of Lieutenant
   Tyler, smiling at her as he passes down a corridor. Fraiser appears
   shocked.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Simmons is showing Daniel a video. On it are SG1, Dr Fraiser and
   General Hammond sitting in the Briefing Room.]

     SIMMONS
     This is a videotape of your briefing before the mission to P7S 441.
     I see four members of the SG1 team, I see Dr Fraiser, I see General
     Hammond, but I don't see any Lieutenants.

     DANIEL
     This could be any briefing.

     SIMMONS
     Take a look at the time code.

   [Daniel does so.]

     DANIEL
     This is a waste of time.

   [Simmons shuts off the video and tosses the remote onto the desk.]

     SIMMONS
     This is not a waste of time. This is an official investigation.

     DANIEL
     Oh no, I mean I get it. We obviously have Lieutenant Tyler issues. I
     say he exists. You say he doesn't.

     SIMMONS
     This is not just about Lieutenant Tyler.

     DANIEL
     Someone else doesn't exist?

   [Simmons holds up a picture of Sarah Gardener.]

     SIMMONS
     I'd like you to explain your relationship with, uh, Dr Sarah
     Gardener.

   [Daniel takes the picture and frowns.]

     DANIEL
     What does that have to do with this?

     SIMMONS
     Dr Jackson, I'm here to investigate potential alien influences over
     Stargate Command. The fact that a Goa'uld has taken your
     ex-girlfriend as a host has everything to do with this.

     DANIEL

     (confused)
     What?

     SIMMONS
     You were very close at one time.

     DANIEL
     That's none of your business.

     SIMMONS
     Your entire life is our business.

     DANIEL
     Do I need to call an attorney or...?

     SIMMONS
     Serious questions have been raised concerning your viability with
     this command. I am giving you an opportunity to respond.

     DANIEL
     Ok, respond. Fine. I lost someone I care about. And not for the
     first time, I might add. You think that makes me sympathetic towards
     the Goa'uld?

     SIMMONS
     I think that makes you someone whose judgement can be easily
     clouded. And for a man in your position that's...unacceptable.

     DANIEL
     What's your position again?

   [Simmons smiles.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [Fraiser hurries down the corridor to the room where Carter is being
   held.]

     FRAISER

     (to the guard)
     I need to speak to Major Carter.
     (He opens the door)
     Thank you.

   [Fraiser enters the room and closes the door. Carter is sitting at a
   desk, writing.]

     CARTER
     What's going on Janet?

     FRAISER
     I need to ask you something. This Lieutenant Tyler you keep talking
     about. What does he look like?

     CARTER
     African American, mid twenties.

     FRAISER
     About five ten, five eleven? I'm not sure, but I think I remember
     him.

     CARTER
     Two hours ago you said you'd never heard of him.

     FRAISER
     I know, I can't explain it, but I can remember his face.

     CARTER
     Does anyone else remember?

     FRAISER
     I don't know.

     CARTER
     Ok. Maybe something did happen to us, but you were never even on the
     planet.

     FRAISER
     I have to report this to General Hammond.

   [She starts to leave.]

     CARTER
     Janet wait. If you come forward now, they'll start suspecting you as
     well. You need to find evidence.

     FRAISER

     (shaking her head)
     Sam...

     CARTER
     As long as we're locked up in here, we can't do anything to help
     Colonel O'Neill. It's up to you.

   [Fraiser appears uncertain.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE, SGC

   [Hammond is standing in his office, looking out at the Stargate. He
   turns and picks up the red phone to make a series of calls.]

     HAMMOND

     (into phone)
     I would like to speak to General Peaceman...

     HAMMOND

     (into phone)
     I would like to know who this man is working for. I appreciated that
     Sir. I need to know...

     HAMMOND

     (into phone)
     I wouldn't be making this call if I didn't consider the matter of
     the utmost importance. Yes I know he's in a meeting with the Joint
     Chiefs. Do you have any idea of when he might become available? I
     see. Alright. Thank you.

   [He finally hangs up.]

   EXT--PLANET--NIGHT

   [O'Neill and Tyler are still hiding in the ruins. O'Neill is keeping
   watch.]

     O'NEILL
     Where you from Tyler? Texas?

     TYLER
     Mostly. We moved around a lot. You?

     O'NEILL
     Born in Chicago, raised in Minnesota.

     TYLER
     Is it nice there?

     O'NEILL
     Is it nice there? You know what Goa'uld really want from us?
     Minnesota that's what. For the fishing mostly. I'll take you
     sometime.

     TYLER
     Fishing?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. Ask Teal'c, he can't get enough.

   [He takes a swig of water from his bottle.]

     TYLER
     When do you think we'll get out of here Sir?

     O'NEILL
     Well if not tomorrow, we'll head up into the hills and wait until
     the Jaffa lose interest.

     TYLER
     They'll never stop hunting us.

     O'NEILL
     What makes you say that?

     TYLER
     Is it...not the way they are?

     O'NEILL
     That may be the way they are. But we're the way we are so...there
     you are. Get some sleep.

   [He returns to his position to keep watch.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Teal'c is sitting at the table while Simmons questions him.]

     SIMMONS
     Tell me Teal'c. How does it feel knowing you betrayed your friends?

     TEAL'C
     I betrayed no one.

     SIMMONS
     You led Apophis into the mothership which was occupied by SG1 and
     the Tok'Ra Selmac. You could have gotten them all killed.

     TEAL'C
     At the time, I was made to believe that my time with the Tauri was a
     subterfuge.

     SIMMONS
     And now?

     TEAL'C
     I am loyal to the Tauri.

     SIMMONS
     Why should I believe you?

     TEAL'C
     If I were still loyal to the Goa'uld you would know it.

     SIMMONS
     Really?

     TEAL'C
     It would be immediately apparent, as I would not hesitate to kill
     you where you sit.

   [He gives Simmons a satisfied smile. Simmons doesn't reply and appears
   taken aback.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Tyler is asleep while O'Neill remains awake. O'Neill looks up as he
   hears an engine noise. A Goa'uld glider flies over head, slows down,
   turns and starts to come back towards the ruins.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah crap.

     TYLER
     What is it?

     O'NEILL
     Glider. Stay here.

   [He grabs the grenade launcher and runs out of the ruins, taking aim at
   the glider. The glider heads towards him, firing but misses and O'Neill
   fires the launcher. The grenade hits the underside of the glider and it
   passes overhead and crashes into the mountains beyond. O'Neill runs
   back to the ruins.]

     TYLER
     Nice shot.

     O'NEILL
     Where in the hell did that come from?

     TYLER
     It might be the glider we saw leaving the area when we where
     checking out the crashed ship transport.

   [O'Neill appears confused by this.]

     O'NEILL
     Right. Anyway, it's made our position. Can you move?

     TYLER
     Not yet.

     O'NEILL
     Not yet. Alright, time to dig in.

   [He starts sorting out their equipment.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [It is Carter's turn to be interrogated by Simmons.]

     SIMMONS
     You have a problem here Major. You say this was your third op with
     Lieutenant Tyler, but based on your own report of SG1's last
     mission, you makes absolutely no mention of his name.

     CARTER
     Daniel's name doesn't appear on all of my reports. Doesn't mean he
     wasn't there.

     SIMMONS
     And don't you think it's odd that not a single person on this Base
     can corroborate your story?

     CARTER
     Yes I do. But what difference does it make? Colonel O'Neill is still
     out there.

     SIMMONS
     And you want us to send out a rescue team based on your word alone
     that he hasn't been compromised.

     CARTER
     We'll go ourselves.

     SIMMONS
     I'm afraid I can't trust you to do that. You see, Dr Jackson's
     motives for being here are coloured by his emotions and they always
     have been. Teal'c changes sides more often than I change the oil in
     my car.

     CARTER
     What about me?

     SIMMONS

     Well let's see.
     (He opens a file)
     You were briefly taken over as a host by a Goa'uld. Once you fell
     under the control of an artificial intelligence of alien origin. The
     last time we met, you harboured an alien in your own home. Now I'm
     beginning to wonder whether all this might have some sort of
     residual effect, because just yesterday for example you violated
     Base security by trying to get into one of the mainframes. I could
     nail you on that alone.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     You're user number 4574, the one who's been accessing our personnel
     files. You don't care about Tyler, you've just been waiting for
     something to use against us. Who are you getting your orders from
     Colonel?

   [Simmons closes the file.]

     SIMMONS
     This interview is over.

   [He turns off the tape recorder.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [O'Neill is planting various explosives, mines and tripwires in the
   ground beyond the ruins. He runs back to the shelter.]

     O'NEILL

     Alright, trips are set. Take the 9 mil.
     (He hands Tyler the weapon)
     If we get into it, make every shot count.

   [Tyler shakes his head, looking at the gun.]

     TYLER
     I cannot let you do this Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Do what?

     TYLER
     I cannot let you die protecting me.

   [In the distance they hear a horn sound.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Hammond and Simmons enter the Infirmary.]

     HAMMOND
     What have you got for us Doctor?

     FRAISER
     Sir, I think I may have figured out what's been happening to SG1. I
     found traces of a foreign chemical on Teal'c's uniform and I've
     completed my analysis.

   [She calls up an image on the computer.]

     HAMMOND
     What is it?

     FRAISER

     Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but its chemical structure
     closely resembles cortical acetacolene, which is a neural
     transmitter that helps to regulate and process human memory. I
     believe that Lieutenant Tyler, or the idea of Lieutenant Tyler is
     nothing more than a chemical implant. Here, take a look.
     (Another image of a CAT scan appears)
     You see, the effect is greatest here, in the temporal lobe
     associated with face recognition. I think it's possible SG1
     encountered someone on the planet who exposed them to this compound
     in order to convince them that he, she or it was somehow familiar.

     HAMMOND
     We're not talking about a vague sense of recognition. We're talking
     about detailed memories that go back weeks before they ever set foot
     on that planet.

     FRAISER
     Yes Sir. And obviously their own minds provided the details
     necessary to complete that illusion.

     SIMMONS
     Didn't your first report say that their MRI's were clean?

     FRAISER
     They were. The chemical dissipates fairly quickly.

     SIMMONS
     So what's that?

     FRAISER
     That...that's me. I was exposed. The chemical passed through a layer
     of plastic, which is probably why I experienced only a diminished
     effect. But this is how I figured it out.

     SIMMONS
     You were exposed to an alien chemical and now you claim to have
     figured it out?

     FRAISER

     (to Hammond)
     Sir, knowing that the contamination requires close proximity, I am
     confident that SG1 could return to the planet and avoid further
     contamination.

     SIMMONS
     You can't trust her.

   [He walks away.]

     FRAISER
     General please. This could be Colonel O'Neill's last hope.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [O'Neill comes running back to the shelter.]

     O'NEILL
     I counted fifteen. Could get interesting.

     TYLER
     Colonel, I am not what you think I am. I am not a member of your
     team, I never was. I am not even human. My race is called the
     Ree'all.

     O'NEILL
     Take you position.

     TYLER
     I exposed you to a chemical that made you think I was one your own.

     O'NEILL
     Whatever, get back there.

     TYLER
     You don't believe me. Look at my leg. It's almost healed. Would this
     be possible if I were human?

   [He stands up.]

     O'NEILL
     Will you get down?

   [He grabs him and pulls him down.]

     TYLER
     I'll show you.

   [He touches O'Neill's temple and O'Neill suddenly sees an alien instead
   of Tyler.]

     O'NEILL
     Jeez. What the hell is that?

   [Tyler changes back.]

     TYLER
     A glimpse of my true nature.

     O'NEILL
     You mean what you really look like?

     TYLER
     It's a natural defence mechanism, a chemical we produce in our
     bodies. That's why I was a prisoner of the Jaffa. They were taking
     me to be dissected and studied. I managed to break free of my cell
     and damage the guidance system of the transport ship. We crashed on
     this planet. That's when you found me. I didn't know if you could be
     trusted.

     O'NEILL
     You've picked a hell of a time to tell me.

     TYLER
     Please, understand Colonel.

   [A staff weapon blast hits close by and O'Neill ducks. A group of Jaffa
   are moving in on their position. One hits a tripwire and is blown up.
   Others trigger the wires as they run towards the ruins.]

     O'NEILL
     Hit the C4.

   [Tyler does so and there are more explosions, killing the Jaffa.]

     O'NEILL
     Again!

   [Tyler blows the C4, killing more Jaffa. O'Neill returns fire, shooting
   any Jaffa who get close.]

     TYLER
     Behind you!

   [O'Neill turns in time to shoot a Jaffa that has jumped over the wall.
   Another runs round a corner and O'Neill shoots him too. As a third
   enters the ruins, O'Neill runs out of bullets and the Jaffa hits him.
   O'Neill strikes him across the face with his gun and the Jaffa draws a
   knife. Another Jaffa runs up, pointing his staff weapon at O'Neill, who
   is still struggling with the first Jaffa. Tyler shoots the Jaffa with
   the knife, but is struck by from behind by another Jaffa and goes down.
   O'Neill quickly raises his hands in surrender. However, one of the
   Jaffa charges his staff weapon and prepares to execute O'Neill. Before
   he can fire, he is struck by a staff weapon blast. The surrounding
   Jaffa are quickly shot with automatic fire. Carter, Daniel and Teal'c
   come running over.]

     CARTER
     I think we're all clear. Are you alright Sir?

     O'NEILL

     (jumping out from cover)
     Fine.

   [Teal'c sees Tyler get to his feet and points his staff weapon at him.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

     TEAL'C
     Lieutenant Tyler is not who he appears to be.

     O'NEILL

     I know. He told me. Stand down.
     (They lower their weapons)
     Let's go.

   [They head back towards the Stargate.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Teal'c has taken point and is leading SG1 and Tyler along a trail.]

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't you just ask for help?

     TYLER
     I'm sorry, but I couldn't take the chance. For generations the
     Ree'all have met nothing but fear and mistrust.

     O'NEILL
     Well sure if you go around tricking people.

     TYLER
     My kind do not embrace technology. We have never been good fighters.
     Our ability to disguise ourselves is our only advantage. Now, the
     Goa'uld are trying to learn our secrets. We are being hunted to
     extinction.

     O'NEILL
     You got someplace to go?

     TYLER
     A group of us have started a new colony on a planet in an isolated
     part of the galaxy. After I return, we will bury the Gate and no one
     will ever hear of us again.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Teal'c signals to the others and they all stop. Keeping low, he moves
   to the edge of the cliff and gestures for O'Neill to come forward.]

     O'NEILL
     What have we got?

     TEAL'C
     We are not alone.

   [O'Neill looks through his binoculars and sees dozens of Jaffa guarding
   the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     It looks like they're going to be there a while.

     TEAL'C
     We must act before further reinforcements arrive.

     O'NEILL
     I don't think so Teal'c, there's too many of them.

     TYLER
     I'll surrender. Once they have me, they'll leave. I'm the one
     they're after.

     O'NEILL
     That's...very brave of you and all, but the last thing we need is
     for the Goa'uld to figure out how you do that...thing you do.

     TYLER
     Then I won't surrender. I'll just lead them away from the Gate. That
     will give you a chance to get through.

     O'NEILL
     You said yourself they'd never stop hunting you. Now we've trusted
     each other this far. We could use a little more firepower however.
     Daniel, stay with...what is your name anyway?

     TYLER
     Yayayeii.

     O'NEILL
     Ok Daniel, you stay with...Tyler. Carter give him your zat. Keep an
     eye out for patrols, stay out of trouble.

   [Carter hands Tyler her zat. Daniel and Tyler remain behind as the
   others move off.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Carter is examining the wreckage of the glider O'Neill shot down.]

     TEAL'C
     The glider's cannon might still be operational.

     O'NEILL
     Like the attitude Teal'c.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Daniel is looking through his binoculars at the Jaffa around the
   Gate.]

     TYLER
     This is all my fault. If I had revealed myself to you from the
     beginning, this could have been avoided.

     DANIEL
     Well, we understand. No one's blaming you.

     TYLER
     Please tell Colonel O'Neill, I appreciate everything he's done for
     me.

     DANIEL
     What are you talking about?

   [Tyler zats him and walks away.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Hammond emerges from his office to find Simmons waiting for him.]

     HAMMOND
     I take it you're waiting to see me Colonel.

     SIMMONS
     Yes Sir. For the better part of an hour in fact.

     HAMMOND
     What about?

     SIMMONS
     I've come to believe that you allow your personal feelings to
     influence your command decisions.

     HAMMOND
     How I run my command is none of your damned business.

     SIMMONS
     Security of this country Sir.

     HAMMOND
     This investigation has nothing to do with the security of this
     country and you know it.

     SIMMONS
     Offworld teams have been compromised. Existing safeguards are
     ineffective. SGC is an accident waiting to happen.

     HAMMOND
     I don't know who issued your orders Simmons, but I've got a pretty
     good idea.

     SIMMONS
     General, with all due respect , it doesn't matter who issued my
     orders. What matters is that in carrying out my orders I have found
     things to be very, very wrong here.

     HAMMOND
     You're being used Colonel. I let this investigation go on long
     enough to make a few phone calls. I learned enough to know your
     orders are politically motivated.

     SIMMONS
     Sir, I think you're missing my point. I don't care.

     HAMMOND
     If it's a fight you're looking for, Colonel, my Washington
     connections go a lot higher than yours.

     SIMMONS
     Administrations change, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     So do orders. Now do I need to have you escorted off my Base?

     SIMMONS
     That won't be necessary General. I know how to leave gracefully. I
     only hope you do.

   [He leaves the room.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Daniel is lying on the ground. Carter grabs him and helps him to sit
   upright.]

     CARTER
     Daniel.

     DANIEL

     (dazed)
     Ah.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, where's Tyler?

     DANIEL
     You know I would have asked him but I was too busy being unconscious
     after he shot me with that zat you gave him, so...

   [O'Neill looks through his binoculars and sees Tyler zatting the Jaffa
   at the Gate. The Jaffa shoot at Tyler and he runs, drawing the guards
   away from the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh for crying out. He's trying to be a hero.

     CARTER
     There's only a few Jaffa left. We could take them out.

     TEAL'C
     This may be our best chance of escape O'Neill.

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Tyler is still running from the Jaffa, this time in his natural form.
   He hesitates briefly and a Jaffa jumps him from behind.]

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [A troop of Jaffa are leading a captured Tyler down a path towards the
   Gate. They come under fire from Teal'c, who is carrying the downed
   glider's cannon. The rest of SG1 emerge from the bushes and shoot the
   remaining Jaffa. O'Neill approaches Tyler and helps him to his feet.]

     O'NEILL
     You're lucky you're not really a lieutenant under my command. I'd
     have your ass for this.

     TYLER
     You could have escaped.

     O'NEILL
     We don't leave our people behind.

     TYLER
     But...I am not one of your people.

     O'NEILL
     Could have fooled me. Actually, you did fool me. Come on, let's go

     TYLER
     What about the Jaffa at the Gate?

     O'NEILL
     They weren't a problem.

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET--DAY

   [Tyler is dialling up the Gate and it opens.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, before your people go and bury your Gate or anything like
     that, you should know that not everyone you meet is going to try and
     hunt you down. We could be allies you know.

     TYLER
     It is not my decision to make, but I will tell the other what
     happened here. It might just convince them we don't have to hide
     forever.

   [He walks up the steps and looks back smiling.]

     TYLER
     Maybe then you can take me fishing.

   [He disappears into the Stargate.]

   FADE OUT

   THE END
