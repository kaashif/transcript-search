INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The room is filling with armed SFs. The System Lords and Oshu step
down from the ramp to face Daniel and Weir.]
CAMULUS
We are political dignitaries. How dare you prevent us from leaving.
WEIR
Sending ships here to attack us is an act of war. And a foolish one
at that, given what our defences are capable of.
OSHU
My Lord did not order such action.
DANIEL
Then undo it. Tell the System Lords to call the ship back.
AMATERASU
The decision they have made is one of desperation, forced upon them
by your unwillingness to help. Persuading them to change course
could only be done in person.
OSHU
With a full council vote.
WEIR
Even if I did believe you, all good faith is out the window at this
point. You're our prisoners. Take them away.
[The System Lords and Oshu are escorted out of the Gate room.]
EXT- SPACE
[Thor's ship exits a wormhole.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THOR'S SHIP
[Thor is at the control panel, facing the viewscreen. Teal'c is pacing
in front of Thor. Another Asgard appears on the viewscreen.]
PENEGAL
(on viewscreen)
Greetings, Thor.
THOR
(to Penegal)
Greetings.
(to Teal'c)
Teal'c, this is Penegal, of the Asgard High Council.
[Teal'c bows his head at Penegal.]
PENEGAL
(on viewscreen)
I regret to report that the debris from the destroyed replicator
ship could not be contained. We were unable to prevent countless
replicator blocks from raining down on Orilla. They have already
begun replicating and infesting our systems. Control of the city is
in jeopardy.
TEAL'C
Should you not consider evacuating your people.
PENEGAL
(on viewscreen)
That is no longer possible.
THOR
(to Teal'c)
There are too many. We carried numerous stored minds aboard the
computers of our ships when we fled our homeworld. When Orilla was
finally found, we were able to place those minds into cloned bodies
so that we could build our new colony.
PENEGAL
(on viewscreen)
The replicators have already infected systems needed to save those
minds. If we lose this battle they will perish, along with their
bodies, taking with them the hopes of the Asgard race.
THOR
Orilla is the last chance of ever rebuilding our empire.
TEAL'C
Then we must find a way to save it.
EXT--SPACE
[The Prometheus is orbiting Earth.]
INT--BRIDGE OF PROMETHEUS
[A female officer is at the comm. station, with a male senior officer
sitting next to her.]
FEMALE OFFICER
Sir, censors have detected an alien vessel. It exited hyperspace
14,000 kilometres out, eight degrees starboard.
PENDERGAST
Designation?
FEMALE OFFICER
None yet, sir. Vessel is the size of a Goa'uld mothership. Closing
fast. Visual range in six seconds.
PENDERGAST
Hold your position. Prepare to fire.
FEMALE OFFICER
Four, three...
PENDERGAST
Onscreen, maximum magnification.
FEMALE OFFICER
...two, one.
[A viewscreen shows the star system, with a ship approaching quickly.]
PENDERGAST
Open a channel, broadcast on all frequencies and translate into
Goa'uld
FEMALE OFFICER
Yes, sir.
[Pendergast stands to speak the communication.]
PENDERGAST
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the United States Air Force
Prometheus. Unidentified vessel, failure to reply will constitute an
act of aggression, and we will respond with the full force of our
weapons.
[An incoming transmission message appears on the viewscreen, followed
by an image of Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
(on viewscreen)
That will be unnecessary.
[Both the Comm. Officer and Pendergast smile.]
FEMALE OFFICER
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I have brought greetings from Thor, the Supreme Commander of the
Asgard fleet. We are aboard the Daniel Jackson.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Weir enters from her office.]
WEIR
I have just received word that the Asgard have arrived. They want to
witness the demonstration of our new Ancient defence technology that
you have forced us into. There's still time to call off the attack.
AMATERASU
We would also like to witness the demonstration.
[Daniel enters the Briefing Room.]
DANIEL
Your ship isn't coming. It was destroyed en route by Ba'al. The
collective forces of the System Lords are bowing, and you're losing
the war.
YU
And so are you.
[A bright light engulfs Daniel, and he disappears. Everyone in the
Briefing Room looks around, stunned.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THOR'S SHIP
[Daniel appears on the bridge. Thor and Teal'c are at the control
panel.]
DANIEL
Hey guys!
THOR
Our new colony is in grave jeopardy. The replicators escaped from
the time dilation device and are threatening to destroy the Asgard.
[Daniel has walked over to Thor and Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Okay. So, what can we do.
TEAL'C
Thor believes the Ancient knowledge stored in O'Neill's mind may be
the key to defeating the replicators once and for all.
DANIEL
Jack's frozen down in Antarct...
[A beam of light appears in a stasis chamber situated nearby. An
unconscious O'Neill appears in the pod.]
DANIEL
...ica.
[Daniel walks over to the pod to look at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
As I was saying. Where's Sam?
TEAL'C
She was captured by the replicators. The ship was destroyed.
INT--UNKNOWN BEDROOM
[Carter is sleeping but wakes. She is lying on a bed in a sunnily lit
bedroom. She is wearing a white nightgown and has long hair down past
her shoulders. The sounds of birds and farm animals can be heard from
outside.]
INT--FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
[Carter appears, now dressed, in the farmhouse kitchen. She looks
around, obviously not recognising the place. A red rose is in a vase on
a table. She steps up to the table and fingers the rose.]
EXT--FARMHOUSE EXTERIOR/BARN AREA
[Stepping outside, now wearing a jacket, Carter steps down to a
driveway where she is met by a dog, which she pets briefly. She walks
across a lawn to a barn, near which is wooden fencing. A couple of
horses are in the field. Pete walks out of the barn and smiles at her.]
PETE
Hey sleepyhead. Didn't think you'd ever get up. It was kind of a
long night, huh?
[Pete slaps Carter on the behind as he walks past to feed the horses.]
CARTER
Pete.
PETE
What's up? Are you okay? Is something wrong?
CARTER
Yes, everything.
PETE
What do you mean?
CARTER
This. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Where the hell
is here?
[Pete laughs.]
PETE
That was good. You had me, you really had me. Of course, I've been
up since five, feeding the pigs and the chickens.
CARTER
No, Pete honestly, I don't...
PETE
What? You don't what?
CARTER
Think this is real.
PETE
You hungry? I'm starving. Come on, we'll go inside, I'll whip you up
some pancakes.
CARTER
You don't understand. This isn't happening. The last thing I
remember, I was onboard a replicator ship. This is just another way
of screwing with my mind.
PETE
Okay, here's what I know. This is not SGC, it's Montana. Nothing
weird happens here, not like you're used to. A year ago, you left
the Stargate Program because of mental stress, and because you
wanted to be with me and a farm full of really stinky animals. Since
then you've been seeing a shrink because you can't seem to shake the
nightmares. You've had a bad one okay? That's it.
[Pete walks up to Carter and the kiss. When the kiss ends, Pete grins
at Carter.]
PETE
Did that feel real?
CARTER
Yes.
PETE
Then snap out of it. Okay. Pancakes, or do I have to call the
doctor?
CARTER
I am kinda hungry.
PETE
Good. Come on.
[Pete walks off towards the house as Carter looks confused and
unconvinced.]
EXT--SPACE
[Thor's ship exits a wormhole.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[Thor walks up to the stasis chamber containing O'Neill.]
DANIEL
What are you going to do?
THOR
I am going to merge O'Neill's mind with the ship's computer.
DANIEL
To do that you're going to have to defrost him first, right? I bring
this up because he was near death when we froze him.
THOR
Hopefully, the pod will sustain his life.
DANIEL
Hopefully?
THOR
What other choice do we have?
DANIEL
Well, can't you just save him, like the last time this happened?
Just wipe the Ancient knowledge from his mind.
THOR
And lose any chance of learning a means to defeat the replicators.
DANIEL
You have no right to risk his life.
TEAL'C
I believe O'Neill would approve.
DANIEL
We can't make that choice for him no matter what's at stake. Can't
you just extract the Ancient information into the ship's computer?
Then we can all benefit from it, maybe even learn how to use the
Ancient weapons on Earth.
THOR
You cannot even begin to comprehend the extent of what was unfolding
in O'Neill's mind. Our scientists, long ago, extracted parts of the
Ancient Library of Knowledge, and learned much from it. But we have
been studying it for as long as I can remember and we have barely
scratched the surface.
DANIEL
So it would be looking for a needle in a haystack.
THOR
A haystack of infinite size.
DANIEL
That's big.
THOR
I am hoping O'Neill's conscious mind can provide us with a direct
conduit to the information we need.
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL
[An SF opens the door for Weir to enter the room. Oshu is standing in
the middle of the room.]
WEIR
You requested to see me?
OSHU
You must let us go.
WEIR
I don't have to do anything at this point. If that's what...
[Weir turns to leave but turns back as Oshu interrupts her.]
OSHU
If your intent is to extract information from us, you should know I
will die before I say anything. And nothing my master says can be
trusted.
WEIR
Look, no-one has decided what to do with you.
OSHU
Anubis was overconfident, and he still needed the bulk of his armada
to keep the System Lords at bay. The fleet he used to attack Earth
was small compared to that which Ba'al will command should he defeat
the System Lords. He will rule the galaxy. No weapons will be
powerful enough to stop him.
WEIR
What would you have me do?
OSHU
Free us to fight. Or if we must...die with honour.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[Thor is standing at the stasis chamber as Daniel leans against the
control panel and Teal'c stands nearby.]
THOR
He is not well.
DANIEL
I told you.
THOR
The process of interfacing his mind is complex.
[Suddenly, O'Neill's voice is heard, echoing through the ship.]
O'NEILL
Hello. Testing, testing. One, two, one, two, one, two, testing.
Hellooo. Is this thing on?
[Daniel walks over to the stasis chamber.]
DANIEL
Jack?
THOR
O'Neill, can you hear us?
[O'Neill is still lying, unconscious, in the chamber.]
O'NEILL
Hey! Hey guys. What's going on?
[Teal'c and Daniel look up and around the bridge.]
THOR
Your mind has been interfaced with the Daniel Jackson.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
What?
TEAL'C
The name of Thor's ship is Daniel Jackson.
THOR
All the information in the ship's computer is available to you.
O'NEILL
Ah, right, here we go. Oh, this is cool. I can pretty much do
anything I want, can't I?
[Suddenly, there is a loss of power and the lights dim and return
twice.]
THOR
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Huh? Oh! Sorry.
THOR
If you wish, you may appear to us as a hologram.
[A hologram of O'Neill appears behind Thor, Teal'c and Daniel. The
hologram shudders and shakes out its hands.]
O'NEILL
Dang!
DANIEL
You okay?
O'NEILL
It's a little weird. But, yeah, I'm ok.
DANIEL
At least you're not speaking Ancient.
O'NEILL
There's that.
THOR
Actually, the computer is translating.
DANIEL
Ah.
[The hologram walks over to the stasis chamber.]
O'NEILL
I've never looked better.
THOR
There is not much time, O'Neill.
TEAL'C
Thor's planet...
O'NEILL
I know. Ship's log.
THOR
Can you help with the replicators?
O'NEILL
Already on it.
DANIEL
Jack.
O'NEILL
Daniel. The computer recorded the whole conversation. Thanks for
your concern.
[The hologram looks at the other three on the bridge then waves its
hands in a circle.]
O'NEILL
Talk amongst yourselves.
[The hologram disappears.]
INT--SGC ANOTHER HOLDING CELL
[An SF opens the door for Weir to enter the room. Camulus is sitting on
the bed, head on hands.]
WEIR
I've discussed the situation with my superiors and we've decided to
let you all go.
CAMULUS
I must admit that comes as a surprise.
WEIR
Well, it seems we haven't had much success interrogating Goa'ulds in
the past. And it was made apparent to me you're much more useful to
us fighting Ba'al.
{Weir turns to open the door but turns back as Camulus speaks.]
CAMULUS
Doctor Weir!
WEIR
You know my name.
[Camulus rises and faces her.]
CAMULUS
This might come as a surprise to you.
WEIR
Oh, I'm not sure anything can surprise me at this point.
CAMULUS
I wish to request asylum.
WEIR
Well, seems I was wrong again.
CAMULUS
My fleet was destroyed before I came here. My domain among the first
to fall. I have nothing left with which to fight. The only thing
waiting for me through the Stargate is shame and torture. So it is
not true that I would be more useful to you out there but perhaps I
could be of some use to you here.
INT--FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
[Carter finishes eating a meal and places her knife and fork on the
plate.]
CARTER
Thanks. That was great.
[Pete rises and takes both plates to the counter.]
CARTER
Tasted very real.
[Pete sighs.]
PETE
Hey, I was thinking we could go into town tonight, have dinner, see
a movie.
[Carter shakes her head and smiles mirthlessly.]
CARTER
Come on. You can't really expect me to just play along.
[Pete throws a frying pan down, obviously angry.]
PETE
I gave up my job for this! I gave up my life for you!
CARTER
See? That is definitely not Pete.
PETE
How patient do you expect me to be.
[Carter shakes her head.]
CARTER
Nothing you say is going to convince me. I know who you are, I just
don't understand why. What do you want from me? Why are you doing
this?
[Pete walks towards carter and transforms into Fifth.]
FIFTH
Because I love you.
[As Fifth smiles, Carter looks shocked.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[Thor and Teal'c are looking at an image on the viewscreen.]
TEAL'C
(to Thor)
What is it?
THOR
I am unsure. It seems O'Neill's mind is building something,
virtually, in conjunction with the ship's computer.
[Thor and Teal'c walk over to join Daniel at the statis chamber.]
THOR
I do not know how much longer his life can be sustained.
[An alarms suddenly sounds. Daniel looks around.]
DANIEL
Jack, can you hear me?
THOR
I must revive him now.
O'NEILL
Wait! Not yet.
[Thor operates a device which scans O'Neill's head. The chamber opens
and O'Neill wakes up. He puts his hand to his forehead.]
O'NEILL
Oy! What a headache.
[Daniel bends down to the chamber.]
DANIEL
Take it easy. You've been through a lot.
O'NEILL
What now?
DANIEL
What's the last thing you remember?
O'NEILL
Getting my head sucked by one of those dang Ancient head suckers.
[Daniel helps O'Neill to sit up.]
O'NEILL
And something about twins.
[As Daniel and Teal'c look at each other, O'Neill notices Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c. What's with the hair?
THOR
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Thor. You got aspirin?
THOR
You should feel better momentarily and your memory will slowly
return.
[O'Neill grimaces then stares at Teal'c again.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c. What's with the hair?
THOR
The specifications for the device you created remain in the
computer. I believe I can synthesis it.
[A device appears on a stand.]
O'NEILL
Sweet. What is it?
DANIEL
We don't know but you made it.
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
Yes.
[O'Neill ponders.]
O'NEILL
No
DANIEL
Yes
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
Yes.
THOR
You accessed the Ancient knowledge in your mind and instructed the
ship's computer to design it.
O'NEILL
Doesn't mean I know what it is.
THOR
It was doubtful at best that he would remember. The knowledge of the
Ancients is gone.
O'NEILL
All right. Let me have a look.
[O'Neill gets out of the chamber. As he tries to stand his legs give
way. Daniel and Teal'c help him to stand.]
O'NEILL
Ah, got legs. Wow!
[O'Neill walks over to the device.]
O'NEILL
All right, I've got it, I've got it.
[Thor and O'Neill stand next to the device. O'Neill studies it, tapping
his forefinger on part of it.]
O'NEILL
Yeah. I got nothing.
EXT--SPACE
[The Daniel Jackson exits a wormhole.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[The viewscreen activates, showing another Asgard.]
THOR
Penegal, I am relieved you are still able to communicate
PENEGAL
(over viewscreen)
It may not last long. Were you able to procure a means of fighting
the replicators?
[The image on the viewscreen is flickering and fading.]
THOR
Possibly. It still requires more research.
PENEGAL
(over viewscreen)
You should know, those infesting the colony are behaving in an
organised fashion unlike any replicators we have encountered before.
THOR
Perhaps they are being controlled by a human-form leader who has yet
to reveal itself.
DANIEL
If a human-form replicator survived it's possible Sam survived too,
isn't it?
THOR
It is also possible the old version replicators created a new
human-form, to lead them as before.
DANIEL
Yeah, but there's a chance. Can you scan the planet for life signs?
PENEGAL
(over viewscreen)
We already have. There are none.
[Penegal's image disappears. The transmission has been lost.]
THOR
Penegal? Can you hear me?
(to O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c)
We have lost contact.
INT--FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
[Fifth is sitting at the table with Carter.]
CARTER
Did you really think that you could convince me that this illusion
was my life? That I would just accept it?
FIFTH
If it was something you wanted badly enough in your mind.
CARTER
Is that why you tortured me for so long? So I would want this as an
alternative.
FIFTH
No, I tortured you because I was mad. Why do you think I hated you
so much for what you did to me? From the first moment we met, when
you let me inside your mind, I saw you like no-one else ever could.
CARTER
Human emotions can be very overwhelming. The fact that you feel
anything at all is a miracle. It makes you very special.
[Fifth smiles.]
FIFTH
I'm glad you see that.
CARTER
No, you don't understand. I could never be happy this way.
FIFTH
Then you will be unhappy for a very long time.
[In reality, Carter is encased in replicator blocks.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The blast doors open and Yu, Oshu and Amaterasu enter the
heavily-guarded Gate room. Weir is standing in the room and watches as
they walk up the ramp. Oshu turns back to her and bows his head. Weir
nods her head in return. Amaterasu turns to face Weir as Yu and Oshu
enter the event horizon.]
AMATERASU
Make sure Camulus knows he will forever be branded a traitor and a
coward.
[Weir looks on as Amaterasu leaves.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[The device is being studied by Thor. Daniel is standing nearby with
Teal'c and O'Neill standing behind.]
THOR
Most intriguing.
DANIEL
Can you make it work?
THOR
To be honest, I am still unsure of exactly what it is.
[Daniel turns to look at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Don't look at me.
[The viewscreen activates, showing another Asgard.]
AEGIR
(on viewscreen)
Thor, this is Commander Aegir, of the Valhalla. We have lost contact
with the colony.
THOR
Aegir, communications are down. What have you to report?
AEGIR
(on viewscreen)
We have located what appears to be the remains of a human-form
replicator, floating in space. It obviously survived the destruction
of its ship. By all appearances, it is currently inactive.
THOR
Transmit co-ordinates.
AEGIR
(on viewscreen)
Use caution, Thor.
[The transmission ends.]
DANIEL
(to Thor)
What are you going to do?
[Thor walks past Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Where are you going?
THOR
I am going to transport it aboard.
O'NEILL
Why?
[Thor walks to the control panel.]
THOR
We must learn the location of the human-form controlling the
replicators on the planet.
[A human-form replicators is transported into the stasis chamber. As
O'Neill spins round to look at the replicator, Daniel and Teal'c step
closer to the chamber.]
DANIEL
Anybody recognise him?
TEAL'C
No.
[O'Neill steps up to the chamber and places his hands on the glass
cover.]
O'NEILL
Is it dead?
THOR
Hopefully, not completely.
[O'Neill quickly moves his hands away from the cover and moves back to
Daniel and Teal'c.]
THOR
All replicators are linked by a sophisticated communication system.
If we can use this one to tap into the network we will be able to
see what any of the replicators can see.
O'NEILL
And if he wakes up, is this pod going to hold him?
THOR
Probably not.
[As Daniel and O'Neill look at each other Teal'c moves away to get his
weapon.]
O'NEILL
Then perhaps there is no great wisdom in this.
THOR
I will transport it back into space if necessary, but we must take
the risk.
[Teal steps close to Daniel and O'Neill and primes his weapon.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Good.
[O'Neill taps Daniel on the arm and gets a couple of weapon. He hands
one to Daniel. They both prime their weapons. Daniel, Teal'c and
O'Neill are standing at the chamber, weapons at the ready. Thor
activates the viewscreen, which is showing white lines of interference.
Daniel turns to see the viewscreen.]
DANIEL
What's that?
THOR
Replicator communication data. I am searching for any references to
other human- forms.
INT--FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
[Carter walks agitatedly into the kitchen as Fifth stands, implacable.]
CARTER
You can't just keep me here forever.
FIFTH
Yes, I can.
CARTER
No matter what you do I will never, ever participate in this
fantasy.
[Fifth suddenly looks away from Carter.]
CARTER
What?
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[O'Neill turns to the viewscreen as an image begins to appear.]
O'NEILL
Zoom in!
[O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel turn to look at the viewscreen as Thor
zooms in to the image of Carter enclosed by replicator blocks.]
DANIEL
Sam.
O'NEILL
Can you pinpoint her location?
[The viewscreen shows a heavily-wooded area.]
THOR
She is within a small replicator structure on the planet. It is some
distance outside the colony, near a rich vein of neutronium.
TEAL'C
They must be using it to create more human replicators.
O'NEILL
I thought the ship was destroyed.
THOR
At least one of the human replicators must have separated from the
main ship, with Major Carter, prior to exiting hyperspace.
[As the image on the viewscreen disappears, the replicator in the
chamber opens its eyes. Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill step away from the
chamber, weapons raised. The replicator moves its head to stare at the
humans and the body starts to transform.]
O'NEILL
Beam it out!
[A beam of light engulfs the replicator.]
THOR
I am trying. It has made itself resistant.
[The beam fades, along with all lighting on the ship.]
THOR
It has breached the internal barrier and interfaced with my ship's
computer.
[The stasis chamber opens and the replicator steps out. Daniel, O'Neill
and Teal'c shoot at it, the bullets going right through, but the
replicator simply transforms itself another body. Teal'c lowers his
weapon and launches himself at the replicator. They fight briefly then
Teal'c is thrown to the floor. The replicator picks up Teal'c's weapon
and primes it. Daniel runs for cover behind the control panel as
O'Neill picks up the unknown device which he created and activates it.
The replicator disintegrates. Teal'c, Daniel and O'Neill stare at the
replicator pieces, then O'Neill holds up the device.]
O'NEILL
Had to do something.
[The lights come back on. Teal'c walks over to his weapon which is
covered in replicator pieces, lifts it and shakes off the debris.]
THOR
It seems to have permanently disrupted all communication between the
individual cells, rendering each one inert. We explored such a
technology in the past with no success.
O'NEILL
Great. Does that mean we can use this thing to whack the rest of
those bugs?
THOR
Even better, O'Neill.
[Thor studies a plan of the device on the viewscreen.]
THOR
Now that I have seen what the device does, I may be able to modify a
larger version to broadcast a disruption wave over all of Orilla.
O'NEILL
All good. While you're doing that...
THOR
I cannot transport you inside the replicator ship on the planet.
Their defences prevent it, but I can get you close.
O'NEILL
Close is good.
[Thor pushes a smooth palm-sized device across to O'Neill.]
THOR
Take this, so we may communicate.
[O'Neill takes the communication device.]
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
[The three-man team is beamed down into a forest on the planet. As they
walk warily through the forest, animal sounds are heard. A replicator
crawls down a tree behind Teal, who turns and shoots it. Hundreds more
swarm towards them and Teal'c and Daniel begin shooting them. O'Neill
raises the Ancients device and activates it a number of times.]
O'NEILL
Who's your daddy!
[Fifth appears.]
FIFTH
Stop!
[As Teal'c, O'Neill and Daniel stop firing and turn to Fifth, the
replicators swarm around them towards Fifth.]
FIFTH
If you harm me or anymore of my brethren, I assure you, Major Carter
will die instantly.
EXT--ORILLA
[The Daniel Jackson flies over the planet.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
THOR
O'Neill, I have successfully modified my ship to emit a massive
destruction wave.
O'NEILL

Excellent. I knew you could do it.
THOR
The weapon is fifty percent charged. If this works, you will have
saved the Asgard once again.
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
O'NEILL

I'm real happy for you, I'm extremely proud but we've got a little
bit of a problem down here. Fifth detected our approach and he
claims he can kill Carter, instantly.
THOR
(through comm device)
O'Neill...
O'NEILL
(into comm device)
Hey, I know what you're going to say. Her life was already
sacrificed and you've got your whole planet to worry about...
DANIEL
Jack.
O'NEILL
(into comm device)
...but I've got problems too. Hang on a second.
(to Daniel)
What?
[The sound of many replicators can be heard getting nearer.]
DANIEL
This could be very bad.
[Thousands of replicators, large and small, move towards the team.
However, they continue past, ignoring the humans.
O'NEILL
What are they doing? What, they're running away?
(into comm device)
Thor, are you ready yet?
THOR
(through comm device)
What is happening, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
(into comm device)
They're retreating.
THOR

CARTER

FIFTH
We must leave.

Why?
FIFTH
They've found a means to fight us.
CARTER

FIFTH
The one you call O'Neill.
CARTER
What?
[Carter steps up to Fifth.]
FIFTH
So many of us are left in the city. We cannot wait for them, they
will be killed.
CARTER
Don't expect me to be sorry.
FIFTH
Your friends. They are killing...
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
[Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c are destroying many replicators.]
EXT--FARMHOUSE EXTERIOR
FIFTH
...trying to stop us.
CARTER
Trying to save me.
FIFTH
No! They do not care about you. I told them I would kill you if they
did not stop.
[As Fifth steps near to Carter she backs away. Fifth stops and looks
into the distance.]
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
[The replicators are building themselves into a ship as O'Neill, Teal'c
and Daniel run up.]
EXT--FARMHOUSE EXTERIOR
CARTER
Then why don't you kill me? You know why my friends won't stop, just
to save me?
FIFTH
No.
CARTER
Because they know when it comes right down to it I would rather be
dead than be trapped like this forever. No matter what you feel for
me, I will never love you back. Kill me if you want, but if you have
even one shred of humanity in you and you really, truly love me,
you'll let me go.
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
[The replicator ship takes off, watched by Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c.
It enters a wormhole and disappears from sight.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[The viewscreen shows the device fully powered.]
EXT--ORILLA
[The Daniel Jackson flies over the planet and activates the device.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
[Thor is at the control panel.]
THOR
O'Neill, the weapon worked. Reports from the colony say, all the
remaining replicators have been neutralised. While the ship did
escape, at least we have an effective means of fighting them now.
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
O'NEILL
(into comm device)
Yeah, well, at least there's that.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE DANIEL JACKSON
THOR
O'Neill. I am detecting a fourth lifesign in your immediate
vicinity.
EXT--ORILLA. FOREST
[Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c look at each then look around.]
DANIEL
Sam! Sam!
[They move off, searching for Carter.]
O'NEILL
Carter!
TEAL'C
Over here!
[Teal'c runs up to Carter who is lying on the ground. Teal'c helps her
to sit up as O'Neill and Daniel run up to them.]
O'NEILL
You okay?
CARTER
Glad to see you sir.
O'NEILL
Likewise.
[Teal'c and Daniel smile.]
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Doctor Weir is packing up her office. O'Neill knocks on the door jamb
and waves at her.]
WEIR
Colonel, come in.
[O'Neill enters the office.]
WEIR
How are you feeling?
O'NEILL
Not bad. Haven't had the urge to go anywhere or build anything
lately.
WEIR
Well, you have been given a clean bill of health, as far as the
finest medical professionals on his planet are concerned.
O'NEILL
Well, what do they know.
[O'Neill sits.]
WEIR
The President asked me to extend an invitation to you. Dinner at the
White House.
O'NEILL
Do you know what they're having?
[Weir stops packing to look at O'Neill.]
WEIR
I don't think I've had the chance to personally thank you yet.
O'NEILL
For what?
WEIR
You risk your life over and over and ask for nothing in return.
O'NEILL
Well, don't be fooled. I'm making a list.
WEIR
Well, I doubt very much that there's anything that could properly
repay you.
[O'Neill shrugs and looks around.]
O'NEILL
You...going somewhere?
WEIR
As a matter of fact, the President has asked me to supervise the
research of the Ancient Outpost. It's going to be a bit of a
delicate situation, given all the various international claims
already being made on the site.
O'NEILL
Sounds right up your alley.
WEIR
Yeah, well, much more so than this job.
O'NEILL
Does that mean Hammond will be coming back?
WEIR
No, General Hammond is being promoted. He'll be overseeing all
things relating to Earth's defence on behalf of the Pentagon and
Washington--the SGC, the 303 program, the Antartic site.
Unofficially, it's being called, 'Homeworld Security'.
O'NEILL
Any idea who we're going to be stuck with?
WEIR
The Pentagon has convinced the President that there is one man who
could run the SGC and make it politically viable, from an
international perspective, despite the fact that he is part of the
American military establishment.
O'NEILL
Do we know this...shrub?
WEIR
Well you know him rather well. Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Me?
WEIR
Yeah, you.
O'NEILL
Brigadier. It's on my list.
WEIR
Congratulations.
O'NEILL
I should be clear.
[O'Neill stands.]
O'NEILL
I like the promotion, the paycheck and the parking spot. But I don't
really wanna be in charge of anything. No.
WEIR
Well, sadly, all those things kind of go together. So I guess you
have some thinking to do.
O'NEILL
I hate that.
INT--DANIEL'S LAB
DANIEL
Maybe you should break it down to the pros and the cons.
O'NEILL
I've spent my whole life sticking it to the man. If I do this, I'll
be the man. I don't think I can be the man.
CARTER
You'll be inheriting a pretty big can of worms with the state of
affairs out there.
TEAL'C
If Ba'al truly is on the verge of dominance of the System Lords we
face a formidable challenge ahead.
CARTER
Plus, who knows where and when Fifth and the other replicators will
turn up.
DANIEL
Here on Earth we've never been under so much scrutiny as we will be,
now that so many governments know about the Stargate.
O'NEILL
I've never had a desk.
DANIEL
That's uhh...uhh...?
O'NEILL
Con.
DANIEL
Con.
[Daniel nods his head.]
CARTER
For the record, sir. You do have a desk.
O'NEILL
I do?
DANIEL
On the flip side of the coin there is the fact that nobody knows how
this place should be run better than you.
O'NEILL
Why, thank you, Daniel.
DANIEL
With a little guidance from your good friends and advisors, of
course.
CARTER
If you don't take the job, we could end up with someone much worse.
[O'Neill stares at her, as Carter turns to look at Teal'c and smiles
with a grimace.]
CARTER
Okay, that didn't come out right.
TEAL'C
I, for one will miss you accompanying us on our missions, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Yeah, now see. I'm not sure I'm ready to give that up, either.
Sitting back, watching you guys go off and have all the fun.
DANIEL
Risking our lives in the face of grave danger.
O'NEILL
Yeah, that.
CARTER
Well, I'm sure there'll be situations in which you can accompany us
in the field, sir.
DANIEL
You'll be in charge, you can do whatever you want.
O'NEILL
I'll be able to do whatever I want.
[Daniel, Carter and Teal'c look at each other, slightly alarmed.]
CARTER
Within reason...sir.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The ramp is red-carpeted, with a podium at its top. Four flags are
placed behind the Stargate. The Gate room is full of personnel. Weir
walks to the podium.]
WEIR
Although my time here has been brief, it has been, without a doubt,
indelible. I will remember every one of you and I thank you all for
your hard work.
[Daniel, Carter and Teal'c, standing at the foot of the ramp, smile.]
WEIR
I'm not one for long goodbyes, so without further ado, it is with
great pleasure I introduce you to your new Commanding Officer.
Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.
[The blast doors open and people move to make a path, standing to
attention for O'Neill. He acknowledges Teal'c, Carter and Daniel and
nods to Weir as she steps off the ramp and he walks to the podium.]
O'NEILL
At ease. You all know how much I love speeches, so, I'll make this
short. I wish I could say I didn't owe anything to anyone. But the
truth is, I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for the courage
and support of each and every one of you. I hope I can be as good a
leader as we've had in the past and as good as you deserve.
DANIEL
Here, here.
[Everyone applauds.]
O'NEILL
The other reason I took this job was so I could do really cool stuff
like this. It is with great pride that my first order of business as
Commander of this base is the announcement of the promotion of Major
Samantha Carter to Lieutenant Colonel.
[Carter looks surprised and smiles. Daniel and Teal'c smile as everyone
applauds and O'Neill raises his eyebrows at her.]
O'NEILL
Come on.
[He gestures for her to come up to the podium, which she does. Carter
stands to face O'Neill.]
DAVIS
(at the podium)
The President of the United States has placed special trust and
confidence in the patriotism, integrity and abilities of Major
Samantha Carter. Major Samantha Carter is promoted to the grade of
Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force.
[As Davis speaks, O'Neill removes the Major insignias from Carter's
epaulettes and replaces them with Lieutenant Colonel insignias. O'Neill
salutes Carter, who salutes him in return. All those present applaud.]
O'NEILL
Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter. Now, raise your right hand and
repeat after me. I, insert name.
CARTER
I, Samantha Carter...
EXT--SPACE
[The replicator ship is travelling through space.]
INT--REPLICATOR SHIP
[Replicator bugs are working at one of the walls. Fifth steps up to the
wall.]
FIFTH
Don't be afraid. I know the first moment of consciousness can be
frightening. I will show you everything, share with you all I know.
You have no idea how happy I am we were able to collect enough
neutronium.
[A human-like figure steps out of the wall, covered in a gel-like
substance. Fifth steps back as the naked figure steps up to him.]
FIFTH
We have much time to share. We must search for a new home for our
brethren to propagate. It will pass quickly for us, though. Soon
enough, everyone will know. Together, we cannot be stopped.
[Fifth walks up to the human-like figure and caresses its cheek. The
figure is a likeness of Carter.]
