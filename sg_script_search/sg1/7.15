TEASER
PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1
[Flashback to the events of The Curse, including the reunion of Daniel
and Sarah Gardner, and her revealing herself as host to Osiris; Grace,
wherein Carter is hallucinating her discussion of her love life with
Jacob Carter and Jack O'Neill; Full Circle, in which Daniel tells the
team about the Lost City of the Ancients being more valuable than
anything; and Fallen where Daniel interprets the Ancients' tablet,
explaining that the Lost City had been purposefully made lost by the
Ancients to prevent it from being found by other people.]
EXT--UNIVERSITY BUILDING--DREAM
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB
[Daniel is seated at a table, surrounded by shelves of books and
artifacts. Many books and artifacts lay open before him. He has a tape
recorder in his hand.]
DANIEL
(speaking into the recorder)
Amulet is likely from the twelfth dynastic period. Inlay and
markings suggest the royal house of Amenemhet; possibly a gift from
the King's immediate family to commemorate a birth or... coming of
age or...
SARAH
It's for luck.
[Daniel turns to see Sarah Gardner suddenly standing in a corner of the
room. He stares at her and she continues.]
SARAH
Royal goldsmiths made them for the King in the hope that the flood
waters would rise again in the Nile, granting them a bountiful crop.
[Still stunned, Daniel turns off his recorder.]
DANIEL
Good guess.
SARAH
Doctor Jordan sent me a picture a few weeks ago; I suppose I had a
bit of a head start.
[There's a brief pause while Daniel looks at Sarah. She extends her
hand.]
SARAH
Oh, I'm Sarah Gardner.
[Daniel shakes her hand and smiles at her. She returns the smile.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM, NIGHT
[Daniel is lying in bed with a memory recall device attached to his
temple and flashing. Osiris stands in the shadows watching him. She
leans forward intently, and we see a memory recall device attached to
her temple as well, also flashing.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--RESTAURANT
[Carter picks up a cup of coffee at the service counter and sits down
at a nearby table to read the paper. A man walks up to her. She looks
at him warily.]
PETE
Is this seat taken?
CARTER
(Looking uncomfortable)
Well no, but there's plenty of other empty...
[Pete sits down opposite her.]
CARTER
...tables.
PETE
Yeah, but none of them have single, beautiful women sitting at them.
CARTER
Well, thank you, but how do you know I'm single?
PETE
There's no ring no your finger.
CARTER
I could have a boyfriend.
PETE
You're having coffee by yourself at 7:30 in the morning.
CARTER
You're very observant.
PETE
I'm a cop.
CARTER
Well, then, I feel compelled to warn you, most of the guys I have
dated recently, have died.
PETE
As in...
CARTER
Dead.
PETE
How?
CARTER
Various circumstances.
PETE
I'll risk it.
[Pete switches seats to the chair next to her. Carter looks annoyed.]
PETE
How about dinner tonight? My motel room.
CARTER
Your motel room?
PETE
Yeah, I'm in town from Denver on a case. I'll order room service;
open a box of wine...
CARTER
A box.
PETE
Something with a duck on the front.
[Carter smiles and laughs, then pulls his head close and kisses him on
the lips.]
CARTER
Stop it, Pete.
PETE
What are you talking about? I'm on a roll here! I-- I haven't even
shown you my badge yet.
CARTER
Aww, and I gotta go.
PETE
Come on Sam, call in sick. Spend the day with me. We'll go to the
zoo.
CARTER
There's no zoo in Colorado Springs.
PETE
(sighs)
Bowling. There must be a bowling alley around here somewhere.
CARTER
I have to work.
PETE
Can't the world wait one more day for more deep space telemetry?
CARTER
Have you seen how much deep space there is out there?
[She kisses him quickly on the lips one more time.]
CARTER
(smiling)
I'll see you tonight.
[Carter leaves and Pete watches her go, a smitten look on his face.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter and Daniel are walking out of Carter's lab together and proceed
along the corridor.]
CARTER
It jams the frequencies the Goa'uld use for communication and the
remote control devices like the ring transporters. Right now, we're
working on making it portable enough to...
[Daniel yawns loudly. Carter looks at him, annoyed.]
CARTER
At least pretend that it's interesting.
DANIEL
No, it was very interesting. Please, go on.
CARTER
Are you tired?
DANIEL
Ya think? I had the weirdest dream last night.
CARTER
About what?
DANIEL
Uh... working with Sarah back in Chicago. Before the Stargate
program.
CARTER
How is that weird?
DANIEL
Uh... things were all mixed up, my hair was different... you know.
[They arrive at an elevator.]
CARTER
Well...
(Carter pushes the button)
No offense, Daniel, but it's not like you don't have some issues to
work out.
DANIEL
Oh, yeah.
CARTER
Maybe you should talk to someone.
DANIEL
I thought I was.
[The elevator doors open, O'Neill is in it.]
CARTER
(Surprised)
Colonel.
O'NEILL
Carter.
DANIEL
(Yawning and indicating a different direction.)
Coffee.
CARTER
(to Daniel)
Talk to you later, okay?
[Daniel walks off. Carter enters the elevator with O'Neill. The doors
close and she starts humming the Stargate theme.]
O'NEILL
(Giving her a long look.)
Humming?
CARTER
I am?
O'NEILL
You are.
CARTER
Sorry.
[They stand awkwardly for a few moments.]
O'NEILL
What's his name?
CARTER
Now, why would--?
O'NEILL
Humming.
CARTER
Pete.
O'NEILL
Pete.
CARTER
Pete Shanahan, he's a cop.
O'NEILL
Speeding again, are we?
CARTER
He's from Denver. He's a friend of my brother's.
O'NEILL
A setup?
CARTER
Pathetic, I know.
O'NEILL
No, it's great.
CARTER
Really?
O'NEILL
Isn't it?
CARTER
Well, it's not serious or anything.
O'NEILL
And yet... it is... hum-worthy.
CARTER
Sir--
O'NEILL
Carter, it's none of my business. I'm just happy that you're happy
about something else then... quarks.
[Carter looks at him.]
O'NEILL
(Pleased with himself.)
Not bad with quarks, huh?
CARTER
(Nods humorously)
Excellent.
[Another awkward pause.]
O'NEILL
Bit uncomfortable, isn't it?
CARTER
Yeah, a bit.
[The elevator doors open and O'Neill walks out.]
O'NEILL
Good luck.
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
[Carter reaches over and pushes a button and the doors close.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM
[Daniel lies sleeping in his bed. Osiris moves in from the shadows and
sits on the bed. Daniel stirs and Osiris activates her ribbon device
over his forehead for a few seconds until he's settled. She then
attaches the memory device to his temple again.]
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB--DREAM
[Daniel is taking notes and reading at his lab table. Sarah walks in
carrying some books and sets them down on the table. She straightens
and puts on a bright smile.]
SARAH
Good morning!
DANIEL
(startled)
Oh... hello. I'm-- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in. I mean,
um... how are you?
SARAH
Fine.
DANIEL
Yeah, you settling in?
SARAH
Well except for want of a decent cup of tea, I'm in heaven.
DANIEL
(distracted by his reading)
That's... good to hear.
SARAH
You know, I must have read everything you've ever published.
DANIEL
(looks up from his book)
Everything?
SARAH
Yes.
DANIEL
(a bit stunned)
What a waste of time.
SARAH
Please, your theories on the Hyksos ruling dynasty are truly
groundbreaking, if a little audacious. I found them quite inspiring.
In fact, I referenced them in my doctoral thesis at Cambridge.
DANIEL
(eyes wide)
You must have failed.
SARAH
(chuckles)
I just hope that I can live up to such talented company.
DANIEL
Well, I'm sure if you're here, then you have-- you are.
SARAH
(coyly)
Stop, the flattery is overwhelming.
[Daniel looks at Sarah a little bemusedly, perhaps intrigued.]
SARAH
(awkwardly)
I-- I should let you continue.
DANIEL
I am gonna continue.
[Sarah stands and starts to move away. Daniel looks at her, then to his
notes, uncertainly, then...]
DANIEL
You know, I know this good place for coffee. No, I'm sure they serve
tea.
SARAH
I'd like that, Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
(smiling)
Daniel.
SARAH
(returning the smile)
Daniel.
(looking at him intently)
You know, I can't tell you how much I have looked forward to being
here with you. Being able to pick your brain and...
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM, NIGHT
[Osiris removes the recall device from Daniel's head and using the
ribbon device, teleports away. Daniel wakes up almost instantly
afterwards, sitting bolt upright and breathing heavily.]
EXT--PARK IN COLORADO SPRINGS, DAY
[Carter and Pete are walking along a path.]
CARTER
That was great.
PETE
Yeah, it was okay. I mean, the company was fine.
CARTER
Oh, come on. How can you not like 'Singing In The Rain?'
PETE
I guess I've always been more of a Fred Astaire fan.
CARTER
It's a classic.
PETE
Whoa. Whoa there, lady. I believe the term classic is reserved for
the likes of The French Connection, Dirty Harry, Serpico.
CARTER
Cop movies.
PETE
What's your point?
CARTER
(giggling)
This was romantic.
PETE
Watching a man dance around in the rain with an umbrella?
CARTER
Just because there were no guns or car chases.
PETE
Or nudity.
CARTER
Yeah, well your chances of that are slim to none now, buddy.
PETE
Have I ever told you what a good dancer I am?
[Carter laughs.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOME, DAY
[Carter and Pete arrive back at her house holding hands.]
PETE
You know, my case down here wraps up tomorrow.
CARTER
Does that mean you're heading back to Denver?
PETE
Actually, I called my captain, and said 'I don't care if crime is
running rampant up there. I met this woman. This amazing person...
and we've got this thing going on.'
CARTER
And what did he say?
PETE
'Get your ass back here or you're fired.'
CARTER
(laughs)
Too bad.
PETE
I'm lying. I told him I'm taking two weeks vacation. Truth is...
Colorado Springs is very... underrated.
[The pair of them kiss passionately.]
CARTER
(pushing him off gently)
Pete...
PETE
And it was going so well.
CARTER
It is.
PETE
But?
CARTER
It's getting late.
PETE
It's seven o'clock.
CARTER
I have to get up really early.
PETE
To go to work?
CARTER
Right...
PETE
Which involves long, arduous hours of you looking into a telescope.
CARTER
(uncomfortably)
Right.
PETE
Sam, have I mentioned I'm a cop? I interrogate people for a living.
CARTER
Are you saying you don't believe me?
PETE
Is this all going too fast for you? Because I can back off... Give
you 5 or 10 minutes.
[Carter laughs. Pete kisses her tenderly on the cheek.]
PETE
I'll call you.
[He stares at her, not moving.]
PETE
Have I left yet?
[She laughs again.]
PETE
I can't feel my legs.
[Carter laughs again. He gives her another smile, touches her cheek and
walks away, leaving Carter staring after him.]
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB, DAY--DREAM
[Daniel is working at his table, studying very intently. Sarah comes in
and sits on the table with two cups of coffee. She sets one down for
him.]
DANIEL
(reaching for the coffee and not looking up from his work)
Thank you.
[Sarah pulls the cup away from him and he looks up at her.]
SARAH
A little human contact first, if you please.
[Daniel and Sarah lean in for a kiss on the lips.]
SARAH
Was that so hard?
DANIEL
(smiling satisfactorily)
Mmm... I'll live.
SARAH
You've been here all night, haven't you?
DANIEL
(looks at his watch)
What, is it morning already?
SARAH
(ignoring the question, smiling)
I've got something for you.
[Sarah opens up something wrapped in cloth; it appears to be the
Ancients' tablet.]
DANIEL
(sets down his coffee and picks up the artifact)
Where'd you get this?
[Daniel studies it, turning it over as Sarah explains.]
SARAH
It was found during an expedition in Morocco last month. An
associate of mine sent it to me for analysis. No one's quite sure
what to make of it. I took the liberty of running a carbon dating.
[Daniel looks at her.]
SARAH
It's over ten thousand years old.
DANIEL
That's impossible.
SARAH
The lack of writing in the pyramids themselves, the inconclusive
dating on several artifacts found at the Henderson dig--
DANIEL
Are you saying that this proves once and for all that there existed
a language on Earth that predates all hieroglyphics?
SARAH
(smiles)
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.
[Daniel slowly runs his hand over the writing on the tablet. Sarah
watches him.]
SARAH
Daniel...?
DANIEL
I recognize this.
SARAH
How could you?
DANIEL
Well, believe it or not, Medieval Latin is a derivative. We can use
it as a reference point.
SARAH
Daniel, how could you possibly know that?
DANIEL
(pauses, thinking)
I don't know... I just do.
[Daniel picks up a book and begins to research. Sarah looks on and
smiles approvingly.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC MESS
[Daniel has his head resting in folded arms on the table. Teal'c and
Carter join him at the same table. Carter rubs his back.]
DANIEL
(Sleepily into his arms)
This makes no sense.
CARTER
Maybe you should eat something.
[Daniel lifts his head and looks at Carter]
DANIEL
Did I mention in the dream, the table was written in Ancient, and in
the dream, I could read Ancient?
CARTER
Well, that's not so odd considering you can also do that when you're
awake.
[Daniel narrows his eyes at her.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps you are attempting to reveal something to yourself.
DANIEL
Like...
CARTER
Like something from when you were ascended.
TEAL'C
Such as you prior vision of Bra'tac and Rya'c in danger.
CARTER
The tablet sounds a lot like the one you found when you were on
Abydos.
TEAL'C
That was to lead to the Lost City of the Ancients.
DANIEL
But didn't. You think that somehow I know the location of the Lost
City, and I just don't remember?
[Carter looks at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
If you have the dream again, perhaps you should translate the
tablet.
[Daniel looks at Teal'c, then looks at Carter. Carter nods in agreement
and Daniel looks back at Teal'c, rolls his eyes, and drops his head
onto his arms again.]
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB, NIGHT--DREAM
[Daniel sets a stack of books on the table and notices Sarah is sitting
at a table, dressed seductively and holding a glass of wine. The table
is set with a tablecloth, lit candles, and a bottle of wine.]
SARAH
I thought you might need a break.
DANIEL
Whoa.
[He walks over to her as she pours a glass for him.]
DANIEL
This is really nice. I mean, uh... I don't really deserve you, do I?
SARAH
(smiles and hands him the glass)
No... Hungry?
DANIEL
Actually, I can't remember the last time I ate.
[He sits down.]
SARAH
(unfolds a napkin)
How's it going?
DANIEL
Oh, I'm so close. I think I found a basic structure to the whole
thing.
SARAH
Really?
DANIEL
(takes his napkin)
Yeah, it's about guidance. Now, at first, I thought that meant some
sort of uh... spiritual guidance, but I was wrong about that. Here.
[Daniel rises up and walks to the research table, retrieving the
tablet. He goes back to sit down and the table with Sarah.]
DANIEL
(showing to her)
Look. Something about a starting point, a place of origin. Steps of
a great journey leading to...
SARAH
What? Leading to what?
DANIEL
A city. A place of great power. (Sarah looks at him intently.) It's
a map, telling us how to find a city where an ancient race of humans
once lived.
[Sarah listens, pleased.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOME, DAY
[Carter pulls up outside her house in her Volvo. She exits her car,
takes her mail from the mailbox, and walks up walkway to find a single
rose on the steps, along with a note. The note reads, 'Dinner at eight,
surprise to follow. Dress up.' Carter smiles.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC WEIGHT ROOM
[Daniel and Teal'c are working out with weights. Daniel is doing arm
curls with hand weights and Teal'c is bench-pressing.]
DANIEL
See, I know what the tablet is supposed to say, I just can't seem to
finish translating it.
[Teal'c sets the barbell in its stand and sits up.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps the location of the Lost City was not the answer you were
searching for in your mind after all. Since I now require sleep, I
have developed an interest in the concept of dreams. There is much
research to study on the matter.
[Daniel sets his weights down.]
DANIEL
Okay, Sigmund.
(claps his hands once)
What are my dreams about?
TEAL'C
Since your friend Sarah was taken as a host by Osiris, you have been
unable to save her. Perhaps that is the focus of your subconscious
desires.
DANIEL
(thinking)
You think something I knew when I was ascended could help?
TEAL'C
Most often dreams are merely the mind's way of dealing with desires
that cannot be fulfilled.
DANIEL
Oh. So basically, I'm destined to never going to get a good night's
sleep ever again.
TEAL'C
Knowing your past experiences, Daniel Jackson, I do not know how you
have slept well before now.
DANIEL
Thank you Teal'c. This conversation has been disturbing on many
levels.
[Daniel puts on his glasses and leaves Teal'c sitting on the weight
bench.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE, NIGHT
[Pete walks up the path to Carter's door, flowers in hand. He knocks
and Carter answers, dressed very sexily.]
CARTER
Up enough?
[Pete stares at Carter, enraptured.]
PETE
I... um... (distracted)
What?
CARTER
(smiling)
I'll take that as a 'yes'.
[She looks at the flowers.]
CARTER
Are those for me?
PETE
Yeah.
(she takes them)
It's the other eleven. The one I left before makes a dozen.
CARTER
I get it. They're beautiful. Thank you.
[Pete offers his arm, and the two of them walk towards Pete's car.]
INT--BALLROOM, COLORADO SPRINGS
[Big band music is playing. Carter's eyes are closed as Pete leads her
in.]
CARTER
Now?
PETE
No.
CARTER
Now?
PETE
No.
CARTER
Now?
PETE
(chuckling)
No, would you stop?
CARTER
How about now?
PETE
No... Okay, now.
[Carter opens her eyes and sees the dance floor, and gasps in awe.
There is a large crowd of elderly people socializing and dancing. A
live band is playing on stage with a huge big banner above saying
'Happy 50th Anniversary Harry and Marg'.]
CARTER
Oh!
PETE
Whadda ya think?
CARTER
(surprised delight)
I think we're gonna get noticed.
PETE
Come on.
[Holding hands, they entwine their fingers and walk in and begin to
slow dance together.]
INT--BALLROOM, LATER
[Later on in the evening, there are only a few people still there. Slow
music is still playing. Pictures of other couples are being taken. Pete
and Carter are still dancing ang gazing into each other's eyes.]
CARTER
This is great.
PETE
It's nice to know that people still stay together no matter what,
isn't it?
[Carter nods and smiles, running her hand up Pete's neck. The embrace,
swaying to the music.]
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB, DAY--DREAM
[Daniel is standing over his table reading from a book and holding the
tablet. Frustrated he gently tosses the artifact onto the table and
straightens up.]
DANIEL
I can't do this.
SARAH
And what's the matter?
[She moves to the table next to him to look at his work.]
DANIEL
I'm just going in circles. I can't find any references that relate
to this passage.
SARAH
Doorways?
[She holds up the tablet.]
DANIEL
(looks at her)
What?
SARAH
(reading from it)
'The origin of doorways.'
DANIEL
(looking at the tablet)
How do you know that?
SARAH
(smiling)
It makes sense, doesn't it?
DANIEL
Yeah, but, how do you know that?
SARAH
Daniel, it's all there. You just need to relax.
[She puts the tablet down and leans in to kiss him. They kiss then
Daniel suddenly pulls back.]
DANIEL
Oh, no.
SARAH
What?
DANIEL
We're supposed to have dinner tonight.
[Sarah smiles shyly, looks at the floor for a second.]
DANIEL
Two months right? I'm so sorry, I totally forgot. Why didn't you
remind me?
SARAH
(smiles reassuringly)
It's all right.
DANIEL
(looking at his watch)
It's too late now.
SARAH
I understand. If it was that important to me, I would have said
something.
DANIEL
You don't mind.
SARAH
Of course not.
[Daniel pauses, his eyes focuses elsewhere.]
DANIEL
You're supposed to leave.
SARAH
(looking up from the tablet to Daniel)
What are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere. Daniel, your
research is gonna change the world. You're a brilliant mind. I don't
want to stand in the way of that. I want to be part of it. I am,
however, going to order us pizza.
[She leans in and kisses him again, then pulls back and smiles.]
SARAH
Get back to work.
[She walks away, leaving Daniel looking troubled.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE, NIGHT
[Carter and Pete are seated in Pete's car. Carter looks a bit nervous.]
CARTER
So, you wanna come in?
PETE
(teasing)
I don't know. You see, the inside of your house, that's a pretty big
step.
CARTER
Suit yourself.
[She opens the door of the car and he stops her.]
PETE
(still teasing)
I'm just saying that right now, you're pretty much perfect. What if
it turns out you're really messy or... worse? You're a neat freak
weirdo with labeled drawers and an alphabetized bookshelf.
[She smiles coyly at him and gets out of the car.]
PETE
(nervously)
Okay, I'm coming.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE
[Carter pushes Pete up against the wall and starts kissing him
passionately. While kissing, she pulled on his tie, then he moves her
against the opposite wall and starts kissing her neck and shoulder.
After a few moments, he looks at her intently.]
PETE
Wow!
CARTER
(smiling and breathing heavily)
Just don't look at the bookshelves.
[More passionate kissing.]
INT--CARTER'S BEDROOM, MORNING
[Carter and Pete are in bed. Pete is gently stroking her bare arm.
Carter is staring into his eyes.]
CARTER
So, why did you become a cop?
PETE
I watched too much TV as a kid. Adam-12, Starsky and Hutch, Barney
Miller.
CARTER
Barney Miller?
PETE
It's my favorite show. Those guys never shot anybody, never beat
anybody up.
CARTER
That's it?
PETE
What did you think? Every cop out there has an inspirational story?
It's just a job Sam.
CARTER
I don't think so. Not for you. And Mark told me you had a story.
[They both laugh.]
PETE
Bastard. Never date your buddy's sister.
CARTER
He didn't tell me what it was.
PETE
It's no big deal. I had a bit of a rough time when I was growing up.
Truth is... I probably would have ended up in jail if it wasn't for
this one particular cop who took an interest. He really made a
difference in my life. I admired that.
CARTER
It's an honorable job.
PETE
Well, my ex-wife didn't think so. Did you ever see the episode where
Barney comes home and all his stuff is on the front lawn with the
divorce papers stapled on top?
CARTER
No.
PETE
I didn't blame her. I mean the hours suck and you never know if... I
didn't have a choice. It's who I am.
CARTER
I can understand that.
PETE
Really? Deep Space Telemetry is who you are.
CARTER
I wish I could tell you more.
PETE
You don't trust me?
CARTER
I'm not allowed.
[Pete turns over, frustrated.]
CARTER
Wh--?
[Pete gets out of bed and starts getting dressed.]
CARTER
Where you going?
PETE
I gotta drive back to Denver today and file my report.
CARTER
Pete, aside from getting into huge trouble myself, I could be
putting you in danger.
PETE
Oh, now you're trying to tell me that joke about your boyfriends all
ending up dead is true?
CARTER
Pete, please.
[Pete moves over to sit on the bed and looks at Carter.]
PETE
The problem is, I feel like I've just scratched the surface with
you, Sam. How can we have a future if you won't share your life with
me?
[He kisses her cheek and leaves.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE, DAY
[Pete walks to the car, puts on a shoe and gets in. Pausing to think
for a few moments, he dials a number on his cellular phone.]
FBI OPERATOR VOICE
Federal Bureau of Investigation. How may I direct your call?
PETE
Special Agent Farrity, please.
FBI OPERATOR VOICE
I'll transfer you now. Please hold.
INT--FBI OFFICE, FARRITY'S OFFICE
[Agent Farrity sits down at his desk as his phone rings.]
FARRITY
Farrity.
PETE
(over the phone)
Hey Dan, it's Pete.
FARRITY
Hey, Shandy! What's up, buddy?
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE, PETE'S CAR
PETE
I'm in Colorado Springs on a case right now and I need a favor, man.
Can you do a background check on someone for me? Top down, global
agency search, the works?
INT--FBI OFFICE, FARRITY'S OFFICE
FARRITY
Sure thing, who is it?
PETE
An Air Force Major. Samantha Carter.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, NIGHT
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S LAB
[Daniel, Teal'c and Carter are all seated at his lab table. Daniel has
his elbow propped up, face cupped in his hand.]
DANIEL
The only thing I don't have is a gate address. There are still a few
passages I haven't been able to translate.
CARTER
Do you think you can?
DANIEL
I don't know. It's like... I- I'm not in control. Like I'm just
along for the ride... watching the whole thing unfold. The strange
thing is, none of it's right.
TEAL'C
Please elaborate, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
I was an idiot. Sarah was in love with me, and I guess I had
feelings for her, too, but my obsession with my research destroyed
our relationship. She finally broke it off with me when I worked
through our anniversary. (shakes his head) The Sarah I'm dreaming
about now is like, totally different. It's like she cares about my
work as much as I do. Like-- like she wants me to find the Lost City
as much as I do.
CARTER
Sounds like a normal male fantasy to me.
[Daniel gives Carter a withering look.]
TEAL'C
Did you not say that Sarah introduced the tablet to you during one
of the dreams.
DANIEL
Yeah...
TEAL'C
And that you feel that you have no control of the dreams.
DANIEL
Yeah...
CARTER
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld possess the technology to explore one's memory.
[Carter glances from Teal'c to Daniel. Daniel looks disconcerted.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 including O'Neill are seated at the conference table with General
Hammond.]
HAMMOND
You're suggesting that Osiris is here on Earth manipulating Dr.
Jackson's dreams?
CARTER
We think it's possible, sir.
O'NEILL
(smirking)
Kinky!
DANIEL
She's looking for the location of the Lost City in my subconscious.
I'm sure of it now. She's using the implanted image of an ancient
tablet to help me figure it out.
TEAL'C
Osiris can access Sarah's memories and use them to more easily gain
Daniel Jackson's trust.
HAMMOND
Well, how's she doing it?
CARTER
We're speculating that she's sneaking into Daniel's house at night
and using some sort of modified memory device.
TEAL'C
Anubis once probed Thor's mind and in doing so they would have
gained access to certain Asgard beaming technology.
DANIEL
That would certainly allow her to come and go undetected.
HAMMOND
Why go to all that trouble? Why not just snatch up Doctor Jackson
and use a mind probe on him, the way they did with Thor?
CARTER
It's possible Anubis' mind probe won't work on the subconscious.
DANIEL
It might have something to do with how Oma erased my memories of
when I was ascended.
TEAL'C
This may be the best way to get Daniel Jackson to unknowingly help
them learn what they wish to know.
O'NEILL
So...what do we do?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld are scavengers of alien technology. They would most
likely interface any Asgard system with their own command device.
CARTER
We're hoping the jamming device we've been working on, could prevent
Osiris from using the beam technology to escape Daniel's room.
HAMMOND
You want to set up a trap.
DANIEL
Yes, but we don't want to spring it until after she's helped me
remember the location of the Lost City.
O'NEILL
(Looks from Hammond to Daniel, alarmed)
What?
DANIEL
Look, no one wants to save Sarah more than I do, but I mean, I could
know. It could be there, somewhere in my subconscious. We have to
let her think that she's still operating without our knowledge. At
least until I have the chance to try to finish this.
O'NEILL
(looks intently at Daniel)
And how are we supposed to know when you know if it's all happening
in your head while you're sleeping?
[Pregnant pause while O'Neill's question is considered.]
DANIEL
(awkwardly)
I don't know?
[O'Neill stares disapprovingly at Daniel.]
HAMMOND
You'd better figure it out. We can't risk letting Osiris escape with
that kind of information.
[Daniel stares at the table bemusedly.]
INT--PETE'S CAR
[Pete is in his car, his cell phone is ringing.]
PETE
Shanahan.
FARRITY
Hey, buddy. It's me. I got what you wanted.
PETE
Just give me the highlights.
INT--FBI, AGENT FARRITY'S OFFICE
FARRITY
Well, there's a lot of backstop ID.
PETE
Works for the Air Force. Does deep space telemetry for NORAD, I
know. Is that all you found?
FARRITY
Actually, it's what didn't turn up that say's the most. The backstop
dead-ends.
INT--PETE'S CAR
PETE
She's been scrubbed.
FARRITY
Yep. Someone went in the system and wiped out every possible trace
of her and left only what they want others to see. She's probably
connected with some top level stuff.
INT--PETE'S CAR
PETE
Like?
INT--FBI, AGENT FARRITY'S OFFICE
FARRITY
Black ops, covert units. Things the government denies all knowledge
of, you know what I'm saying? Look Pete, if you ask me, this Major
Carter's connected. You might wanna back off from this one. Okay,
buddy? It's way out of your league.
PETE
Hey! It's not like I'm dating her or anything.
FARRITY
(smiles knowingly)
Right.
[Farrity hangs up.]
INT--PETE'S CAR
[Pete hangs up, thinking.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE, NEXT DAY
[Carter exits her house. Pete is waiting in his car outside her house,
parked up the street. Carter gets in her car and drives away. Pete
starts his and follows.]
INT--SGC, CARTER'S LAB
[Carter is on the phone. It's ringing.]
PETE'S ANSWERING MACHINE
Hello--
CARTER
Hi, it's me--
PETE'S ANSWERING MACHINE
...this is Pete. I'm probably chasing a bad guy. Leave a message.
[She hangs up just as the answering machine recorder beeps. O'Neill
enters the lab.]
O'NEILL
(looking at the equipment)
So what do we got?
CARTER
Uh, Daniel's at his house with the team, setting up video
surveillance.
[O'Neill examines a box of Goa'uld tranquilizer darts.]
O'NEILL
(brightly)
Teal'c's picking out his doughnuts. He loves a good stakeout.
[She smiles and nods.]
CARTER
Jamming device has been installed in the surveillance van. It should
prevent Osiris from beaming herself out.
O'NEILL
(pulling out a dart and holding it up)
We're taking her down with these?
CARTER
She likely has a personal shield, but we know that a tranquilizer
dart'll get through. At that point we hope that the Tok'ra can
safely remove the symbiote and save Sarah.
O'NEILL
(putting the dart back)
What about this whole Lost City deal?
CARTER
We watch and see. Once in his room, Osiris won't be able to leave.
It's just a question of us getting to her before she realizes that
she's been made.
O'NEILL
Back up?
CARTER
Local authorities have been notified, but we don't wanna do anything
to alert Osiris.
[Carter closes the equipment case.]
O'NEILL
How's Pete?
CARTER
(uncertain)
You know how it is. Usually you don't let it bother you because you
know that they couldn't cope with the truth anyway.
O'NEILL
(nods)
Usually.
CARTER
(shrugging)
I think he could have.
EXT--DANIEL'S HOUSE, NIGHT
[The surveillance van is parked along the street across from Daniel's
house.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[O'Neill is viewing the surveillance monitors, while Carter and Teal'c
are monitoring computer readings. All are wearing earpieces and
microphones. O'Neill picks up the two-way radio, then shifts his
microphone mouthpiece closer.]
O'NEILL
Hey, Daniel. Daniel! You sleeping yet?
[The monitor shows Daniel lying on his bed.]
DANIEL
Yes, Jack. I'm fast asleep.
[O'Neill's eyes shift for a second to his team in the van, a bit
self-consciously, then back to Daniel's image on the monitor. Carter
and Teal'c smile at each other knowingly.]
EXT--DANIEL'S HOUSE, PETE'S CAR
[Pete is watching the surveillance van through binoculars.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[The team is still monitoring Daniel's house. Teal'c pulls out his box
of doughnuts and offers them to O'Neill and Carter. Carter shakes her
head.]
O'NEILL
What do you got there?
[Looks in the box]
O'NEILL
No, I'll pass.
[Teal'c looks disappointed. O'Neill goes back to looking at the screen.
Cut to the monitor with Daniel lying asleep on his bed. Suddenly the
room is aglow as Osiris beams in. O'Neill sees this.]
O'NEILL
Here we go.
[O'Neill watches as Osiris sits on Daniel's bed.]
CARTER
Activating frequency jamming.
[She hits a few switches. Seeing the jamming is working, O'Neill bolts
out of his chair.]
O'NEILL
Let's do it.
[Teal'c is fast on his heels as they exit the van. Carter moves over to
the video monitor.]
EXT--DANIEL'S HOUSE, PETE'S CAR
[Pete watches O'Neill and Teal'c run across the street to the house. He
sees one of them carrying a rifle. He lowers his binoculars, curious.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Carter continues to watch the video surveillance monitor, seeing
O'Neill and Teal'c stealthily moving through Daniel's house. She then
looks at Daniel's monitor to check on him.]
EXT--DANIEL'S HOUSE, PETE'S CAR
[Pete still watches from his car as night transitions to morning.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[The surveillance monitor shows O'Neill's position in Daniel's house.
O'Neill moves the microphone to his mouth.]
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Carter.
CARTER
She's still there, sir.
O'NEILL
How long do we wait?
CARTER
I don't know. Daniel must be getting close.
[Daniel's monitor shows him in REM sleep, while Osiris sits by the side
of the bed watching.]
INT--UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB--DREAM
[Daniel is looking at the tablet through a magnifying glass.
Frustrated, he sets them both down forcefully and sits back in his
chair, sighing heavily. Sarah comes up behind him and puts her arms
around him.]
SARAH
Progress?
DANIEL
Not really. I'm still convinced these symbols represent the location
of the city.
SARAH
Like an address?
DANIEL
Yeah. Yeah, there's seven of them. They don't translate into
anything specific.
SARAH
You're so close.
DANIEL
No, I am not!
SARAH
Don't say that, Daniel.
[She rises up and walks away to sit across from him, concerned.]
DANIEL
They mean nothing to me.
SARAH
You've worked too hard to give up now.
DANIEL
I don't know. (pointedly)..I never knew.
[Sarah stares at him grimly.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM
[Daniel startles himself awake and sees Osiris standing over him, a
murderous look on her face.]
OSIRIS
How unfortunate for you.
[She raises up the ribbon device and activates it.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[On the monitor, Carter sees that Osiris is attacking Daniel.]
CARTER
Move in! Move in!
[Carter watches O'Neill move from his position.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM
[O'Neill gets into position in the door and takes aim with the rifle.
Osiris sees him and he gets off a shot, but she uses her hand device
and flings O'Neill against the corridor wall.]
O'NEILL
Aah!
[He slumps to the floor in the hallway, and Osiris hits her hand device
in an attempt to beam out. It doesn't work. She tries again, but
can't.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Carter sees that Osiris is attempting to leave the house from the
monitor. The surveillance camera on Teal'c shows him moving into
position to confront Osiris.]
INT--DANIEL'S HOUSE
[Teal'c turns a corner and aims him weapon. Osiris sees him and fires
what appears to be an Ashrak hand weapon. She misses and hits vase
instead. With Teal'c pinned down, Osiris moves for an exit.]
INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Carter sees Osiris getting away and grabs her weapon.]
EXT--NEAR SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Carter jumps out of the van and heads Daniel's house, but Pete is
right behind her.]
PETE
Sam.
CARTER
(shocked)
Pete, what are you--
[A shot from Osiris' weapon hits the front of the van. Both dive for
cover.]
CARTER
Get down!
[Osiris takes aim. Moving in, she fires again at the van. Pete is
behind the van and Carter is tucked behind the back of the car in front
of the van. Carter activates the zat as Osiris fires again. Carter
shoots the zat, but Osiris is using her personal shield. Pete sees this
and is stunned.]
PETE
Holy--
[Another shot at the van causes him to duck.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM
[Teal'c stops to check on O'Neill but he waves Teal'c in to check on
Daniel. Daniel is sitting up and trying to remove the memory device as
Teal'c gets to him. Daniel manages to remove the device.]
DANIEL
(in pain)
Aah!
TEAL'C
Will you be all right, Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
Yeah. Go, go, go.
[Reluctantly, Teal'c moves away as Daniel pants in obvious pain.]
EXT--NEAR SURVEILLANCE VAN
[Pete leaps up from his position and fires his automatic at Osiris. The
personal shield glows with each hit and Pete pauses for a moment, then
fires repeatedly again before ducking another shot at the van from
Osiris.]
CARTER
It's no use, Pete!
PETE
Yeah, why is that?
[Meanwhile, Osiris spies the van's gas tank. Her eyes glow as an idea
occurs to her. Pete sees her eyes and is alarmed.]
PETE
Now, that is not normal.
[Osiris takes aim and Carter sees her intention. She leaps from her
position.]
CARTER
Look out!
[She and Pete both run away from the van as Osiris fires at it. The van
explodes and the blast hurls Carter and Pete to the ground. Pete
shields Carter from the blast. At the house, Osiris smiles
triumphantly, but the sound of a dart being shot is heard and Osiris is
hit.]
OSIRIS
Uhh!
[She turns around and sees O'Neill lowering his weapon, having hit his
target. Osiris pulls the dart from her body and stares at it then back
at O'Neill. Teal'c raises his weapon, then Osiris' knees buckle and she
collapses. O'Neill moves toward her and kneels down to check.]
O'NEILL
Clear!
[On the other side of the street, Pete rolls away and Carter turns over
and looks at him.]
CARTER
Are you okay?
PETE
I'm okay. Are you okay?
CARTER
Yeah.
PETE
That's good.
[He sinks slowly to the ground again and Carter sees he's not okay. She
sits up and puts her had on his belly.]
CARTER
(alarmed)
Oh, God, Pete, you've been hit.
PETE
Have I?
[O'Neill looks over at Pete and Carter.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
It's Pete. He needs an ambulance!
(to Pete)
Just hang in there, okay?
PETE
(breathing heavily)
Sam? What just happened?
CARTER
I promise, if you make it through this, I will explain everything.
PETE
Deal.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY--SARAH'S BED
[Sarah lies sleeping in a hospital bed. Daniel is sitting on the bed by
her side as she comes to with a start.]
DANIEL
(reassuringly)
It's all right. You're safe.
[He reaches out to touch her.]
SARAH
(sitting up)
Daniel?
DANIEL
I'm here.
(she sits up)
It's all over.
(Sarah embraces Daniel)
You're free.
[Daniel holds her.]
SARAH
(crying)
I'm so sorry.
DANIEL
Shhh... It's not your fault.
SARAH
I couldn't stop it.
DANIEL
We're gonna get you through this.
[Daniel holds her and strokes her back. She looks haunted.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY--PETE'S ROOM
[Carter enters. She's holding a gift.]
CARTER
Hey, they treating you okay?
PETE
Yeah. Who would have thought there's a hospital under Cheyenne
Mountain?
CARTER
One of the best anywhere.
PETE
This place is unbelievable.
CARTER
You've no idea.
[She hands him the gift--a picture of them dancing.]
PETE
Thanks.
[She kisses him.]
PETE
I believe I lived up to my end of the bargain.
CARTER
What I'm about to tell you is classified under section 11-C-9 of the
National Security Act.
PETE
Chicks with laser beam rings and glowing eyes are classified under
11-C-9.
CARTER
(gently admonishing)
Let me talk, will you?
PETE
(placatingly)
Okay.
CARTER
You're currently in a top secret military facility known as Stargate
Command. In 1928, in Giza, Egypt, archaeologists uncovered an
ancient device capable of instantaneous transportation to other
planets by means of a sub-space wormhole.
PETE
(smiling)
I knew it! This is way better than a box of wine with a duck on the
front.
[He laughs and waves her off.]
CARTER
I'm not kidding.
PETE
(sees she's serious)
Sorry... Other planets. Wormholes.
(he smiles)
Continue.
[Carter returns his smile.]
