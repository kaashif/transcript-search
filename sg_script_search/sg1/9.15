INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Through the window, guards can be seen at the ready near an active
Stargate. The iris is closed. Klaxons blare. Mitchell sits on a
backward-facing chair; Harriman sits next to him. Daniel approaches.]
DANIEL
What's up?
HARRIMAN
Incoming wormhole from Tegalus.
MITCHELL
A Jared Kane is requesting to be let through. Says he needs to speak
to you and it's urgent.
HARRIMAN
On radio.
[Harriman flips a switch.]
DANIEL
Jared, this is Daniel. What's wrong?
KANE
(over radio)
Doctor Jackson, I have very little time. I've gained access to the
Stargate without my government's authorization. Please allow me to
come through. I am alone, and unarmed.
[Mitchell and Daniel exchange looks. Daniel nods his approval.]
MITCHELL
(to Harriman)
Open the iris.
[Harriman opens the iris.]
DANIEL
Okay, Jared, it's safe to come through.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Kane comes through the Stargate, arms open wide to indicate no
aggression. Mitchell and Daniel jog into the room.]
MITCHELL
(to the guards)
Stand down.
[The guards in the room lower their weapons.]
KANE
Doctor Jackson.
DANIEL
Jared, this is Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Tegalus, post-apocalyptic warring superpowers with deep seeded
political differences. That Jared Kane. It's nice to meet you.
DANIEL
Your government stopped responding to our communiqués months ago. We
assumed that you...
KANE
(interrupting)
Completely destroyed each other? Not quite yet.
DANIEL
I was going to say "no longer wanted our help" but, that'll do.
KANE
No, the Rand Protectorate is still struggling to rebuild and defend
itself from the Caledonian Federation.
DANIEL
Okay, what's so urgent?
KANE
Five months ago, a man came through the Stargate. He called himself
a Prior of the Ori.
MITCHELL
(muttering)
Here we go.
DANIEL
Yes, we're aware of the Priors and what they're preaching.
KANE
The Prior wasn't just offering us religion, he offered us power. In
exchange for our embracing the Ori, he gave our government designs
for a weapon that could be launched into orbit. A satellite capable
of giving us total domination over the Caledonians.
DANIEL
(wincing)
Okay, assuming your people intend on building this weapon, how long
before it's completed?
KANE
Twenty-four hours ago, a Caledonian military outpost was completely
vaporized in a demonstration. The weapon is already operational.
[Daniel and Mitchell exchange somber looks.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 sits around the briefing table. Kane stands at the other end of
the room by a television monitor depicting a map of Tegalus.]
MITCHELL
How long until your government makes its next move?
KANE
Our President has given their leader, Minister Chaska, a deadline of
five days. After that, if the Caledonians don't surrender to Rand
occupation, they'll be destroyed.
DANIEL
And the Prior instructed you to do this?
KANE
(stepping forward)
Rand has been in disarray since the missile attacks last year.
Intelligence reports were filtering in that said the Caledonians
were preparing a full-scale ground assault. They were going to
invade and attempt to topple what was left of Rand once and for all.
MITCHELL
Caledonia wasn't interested in hearing from this Prior?
KANE
The Prior asked our leaders if he could spread his word to the
Caledonians as well.
DANIEL
(bitterly)
Of course, they would never accept anything that Rand was already
embracing.
KANE
President Nadal explained that to the Prior. He said anyone who
didn't accept Origin must be destroyed.
MITCHELL
Man, these guys got a bottomless bag of tricks, don't they?
DANIEL
I'm guessing it was also the Prior that convinced your people that
having a relationship with us was no longer necessary.
KANE
It was already clear your government wasn't going to offer us the
type of weapons and technology this Prior was offering us. You see,
we weren't just on the verge of suffering defeat at the hands of the
Caledonians, we were on the verge of collapsing as a nation. But
now, after what you've told me of these Ori and the Priors, I fear
that may have been a better way to go.
[Kane sits at the table.]
CARTER
We appreciate your situation, but what exactly do you want from us?
KANE
(pushing a tube-shaped case across the table)
These are the earliest schematics for the weapon. Unfortunately,
they're not complete. The Prior gave us step-by-step instructions in
stages.
[He pushes a cylindrical case towards Carter. She opens the case.]
MITCHELL
Making sure he kept you under his thumb.
KANE
He said it was so he could make sure each stage was completed
properly, before we moved onto the next. It's the best I could do
under the circumstances. Access became restricted soon after some of
us in government voiced our disapproval about building the weapon.
TEAL'C
You wish us to destroy the weapon.
KANE
It's the only chance we have to stop things before they go too far.
MITCHELL
Just to be clear, you're doing this to save Caledonians? You don't
hate them for bombing your country and killing so many of your
people?
KANE
I do. But I refuse to see any more lives, be they Rand or
Caledonian, senselessly lost due to archaic prejudices or religious
extremism. This has to stop.
MITCHELL
Would you excuse us for a moment?
[Mitchell gestures with his head and moves to Landry's office. Puzzled,
the rest of SG-1 follow.]
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[SG-1 enters Landry's office.]
CARTER
What are we doing?
[Mitchell closes the door behind Daniel.]
MITCHELL
Talking privately. I'm sure General Landry won't mind. You want the
big chair?
[Mitchell gestures to Landry's chair. Carter shakes her head, eyes wide
with fear.]
CARTER
Not me. I'll sit here.
MITCHELL
Sam, he's in Washington.
CARTER
Yeah.
[She quickly takes a seat on the other side of Landry's desk. Teal'c
stands behind her. Daniel settles himself on the edge of Landry's desk,
near Carter. Mitchell looks at Landry's chair for a few moments,
considering sitting there before thinking better of it.]
MITCHELL
Right.
[Mitchell sits on the credenza by the window to the briefing room.
Carter suppresses a smirk. Kane can be seen through the window behind
Mitchell pacing the briefing room.]
DANIEL
Let me just start this by saying, a lot of this is actually our
fault. There wouldn't have been a war on Tegalus if we hadn't gone
there in the first place.
MITCHELL
General O'Neill probably said it best: "The minute we step through
the Gates, we're sticking our collective noses where they don't
belong."
CARTER
We did offer to help them rebuild.
TEAL'C
(rolling his eyes)
An offer they eventually declined.
DANIEL
Because they were being influenced by a Prior.
MITCHELL
And this satellite thing takes it to a whole new level. The Ori are
now arming their followers.
CARTER
Who says they won't eventually help them build ships capable of
attacking other planets?
MITCHELL
We need to nip this trend squarely in the bud.
DANIEL
So, what, we just fly in there and blow it up?
MITCHELL
Yeah. Unless, you have a better idea.
DANIEL
All Tagaluns, both Rand and Caledonian alike, deserve to know the
truth. If we tell them what we know, who the Ori really are, they
might be convinced to dismantle this weapon themselves.
MITCHELL
Do you think they'll listen?
DANIEL
Let's just propose it to Kane, and see if Rand will hear us out.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Mitchell, Carter, and Teal'c study a blueprint of the Caledonian
weapon.]
MITCHELL
So, can we use these plans to build ourselves a satellite weapon?
Hey, you've got to ask.
CARTER
These plans are incomplete. I mean, it's not even clear what's
powering the weapon.
TEAL'C
Kane did say they were early schematics.
MITCHELL
So, not useful?
CARTER
Well, enough to see that it's not very efficient. For example,
(pointing out a feature on the schematic)
these capacitors take several minutes to store enough power to fire
the weapon, and then again before it can repeat.
MITCHELL
Wow, you'd think an Ori weapon would be more advanced.
CARTER
Well, the Ori may have designed it for them, but Rand still had to
build it using the resources and technology at their disposal. Now,
remember that it wouldn't take much by our standards to give Rand
vast military superiority over Caledonia.
TEAL'C
Then it can be easily destroyed.
CARTER
If these plans are an accurate indication.
MITCHELL
Right, so we'll take Prometheus with us.
CARTER
Shouldn't be a problem. The satellite appears to be a predominantly
offensive weapon.
MITCHELL
No defenses?
CARTER
Well, it stands to reason. Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing
even close to capable of reaching orbit. Although, there do appear
to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may
be detected.
TEAL'C
The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology.
CARTER
Exactly. As I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will
take a few minutes to charge up. We should be able to emerge from
hyperspace and take a shot at it before it can respond. If, for any
reason, it doesn't go well, we jump back into hyperspace.
INT--SGC COMMISSARY
[Kane sits by himself at a table in the mostly empty commissary. An SF
stands watch nearby. Daniel enters the room.]
KANE
Anything yet?
DANIEL
(referring to Rand)
Give them some time. They seemed...shocked that you were here.
KANE
(softly)
I'm sure they were.
[Daniel sits across from Kane.]
DANIEL
You don't think they'll listen to us?
KANE
Our people suffered greatly after the war. They needed to believe
there was a reason for what was happening to them.
DANIEL
And the Prior provided that.
KANE
He said our suffering was a test, to see who was worthy.
DANIEL
Well, if it makes you feel any better, your planet's not alone.
(after a moment)
Kane, I--I have to ask...Leda?
[Kane pauses for a few moments, studying Daniel before responding.]
KANE
Five months ago, while Rand was deciding whether to accept Origin or
not, a disease swept through the country. Thousands became deathly
ill. The Prior said those who believed and embraced the Ori would be
cured. That's when people everywhere began accepting them as gods.
We watched...so many barter away their beliefs in exchange for their
lives.
(with sad smile)
But Leda, she--she refused to accept it.
DANIEL
(in low voice)
I am sorry.
[Harriman enters the commissary.]
HARRIMAN
Doctor Jackson, we've just received a communiqué from the Rand
government.
[He hands Daniel a paper. Daniel reads it.]
DANIEL
They want to talk.
EXT--RAND PROTECTORATE CAPITAL CITY, TEGALUS, DAY
INT--RAND PROTECTORATE JAIL CELLS
[Daniel and Kane sit on benches, locked in neighboring jail cells.]
DANIEL
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
KANE
What happens if your people don't hear from us?
DANIEL
I told them to proceed with destroying the weapon.
[An outer door clangs open, and Daniel and Kane move forward to the
doors to their cells. Nadal and two guards approach the cells from the
hallway outside.]
KANE
President Nadal.
NADAL
Senator Kane.
KANE
This is Doctor Daniel Jackson.
KANE
I know who he is.
DANIEL
I'm here representing Earth on a diplomatic mission.
NADAL
I am here to officially inform you, Jared Kane, you are under arrest
for treason.
DANIEL
(upset)
Excuse me? You allowed us to come here under false pretenses?!?
NADAL
Doctor Daniel Jackson, your government has knowingly harbored a
felon. As well, it seems, they are in possession of top secret
documents vital to the security of this country. As of now, you are
both considered enemies of the state, and will be detained until
trial can be set.
[Nadal and the guards leave. Daniel and Kane are left in their cells,
looking resigned.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Prometheus moves at faster-than-light speed through hyperspace.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Marks, Pendergast, and Womack sit at their usual stations. Mitchell
and Teal'c, in F-302 jumpsuits, and Carter in black BDUs, stand nearest
the door to the bridge.]
MARKS
Approaching the planet, sir.
PENDERGAST
Prepare to lock on Doctor Jackson's locator beacon the moment we
drop out of hyperspace.
WOMACK
(flipping some controls)
Yes, sir.
INT--RAND PROTECTORATE JAIL CELLS
DANIEL
I guess I can assume that any kind of trial will be rigged?
KANE
Honestly, we'll be lucky to get that far. President Nadal has been
paranoid about Caledonian spies for some time now. Because I
betrayed him this way, he may assume I'm also part of that network.
DANIEL
(dryly)
Great. I don't suppose your country has any laws against torture?
KANE
No.
[Pernaux and guards approach Kane's cell. One guard opens it with a key
and Pernaux enters.]
PERNAUX
I applaud your courage, Kane.
KANE
Commander Pernaux, Doctor Jackson. Doctor Jackson--
DANIEL
(interrupting)
Yeah, I--I got it.
PERNAUX
What I don't understand is why you came back.
KANE
Doctor Jackson and I felt there was some things the Rand people
needed to know.
PERNAUX
The only thing I "need to know" are the names of those among us who
are working for the Caledonians.
KANE
Just because I went to Earth for help doesn't mean I've also given
information to the Caledonians or know who might have.
PERNAUX
Earth is responsible for our current state of affairs. Turning to
them is an act of a desperate man, Kane.
DANIEL
(gripping the bars between their cells)
Kane turned to us in the hopes of preventing you from making a
catastrophic mistake. The Priors are not telling you everything
about the Ori. You need to hear me out before you use that weapon to
wipe out the Caledonians.
PERNAUX
So you admit, you sympathize with Caledonia.
KANE
(irritated)
That's not what he's saying.
PERNAUX
How the next few days unfold is entirely up to you. But until I find
out who else is working with you, I guarantee neither of you will
know a moment's peace.
[Pernaux leaves the cell. The guard locks the door behind him.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Prometheus drops out of hyperspace and approaches Tegalus.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
WOMACK
I have a signal from Doctor Jackson's locator beacon.
PENDERGAST
Beam him directly onto the bridge.
[The Asgard beam activates. Beamed aboard is the locator beacon and
wrist strap. Mitchell approaches the device and picks it up.]
MITCHELL
(dismayed)
I take it this means things aren't going so well.
[He hands the device to Teal'c, who looks troubled.]
CARTER
(also upset)
Coupled with the fact that we haven't heard from him since he left
two days ago...
MARKS
We have located the satellite.
PENDERGAST
Lock on target.
TEAL'C
This will be perceived as an act of aggression against Rand.
CARTER
We could be risking any chance of negotiating for Daniel's safe
return.
INT--RAND PROTECTORATE BUNKER
[Klaxons blare as Nadal storms into the bunker and passes several
soldiers before reaching Pernaux.]
NADAL
Commander?
PERNAUX
Mr. President, the satellite's sensors have detected a ship closing
on its position.
[Both stare at a large computer display on the wall. It displays a
portion of the planet and the nearby space above it. The satellite is
marked. Nearby a round blinking dot indicates the position of a ship
(the Prometheus).]
EXT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
WOMACK
Target has been acquired, sir.
PENDERGAST
We've got the satellite dead to rights. We can hail them and ask for
Doctor Jackson in exchange.
TEAL'C
(somberly)
That would not accomplish the goal of this mission.
MITCHELL
(stonily)
Jackson knew it might come to this. He told us to proceed no matter
what.
CARTER
(resigned)
He wouldn't want us to trade his life for thousands, possibly
millions of Caledonians.
PENDERGAST
Well, it's your call, Colonels. All I'm asking is that you make up
your mind quickly.
WOMACK
Sir, we're detecting a power build-up from within the satellite.
[Carter leans forward and studies the display. The monitor shows a
graphic depiction of the satellite adjusting its position.]
CARTER
Its attitude is changing.
MARKS
We're being targeted.
PENDERGAST
Sound general quarters. Full power to the forward shield generators,
and maintain course and speed.
[Klaxons blare. Mitchell, Carter, Teal'c, and Pendergast exchange
looks. Carter grits her teeth and closes her eyes. Teal'c briefly
nods.]
MITCHELL
(soberly)
Do it.
PENDERGAST
Fire.
WOMACK
Firing missiles.
EXT--SPACE, ABOVE TEGALUS
[The Prometheus fires two missiles directly at the satellite. They head
straight for it, but impact a shield before reaching the device and
explode harmlessly.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
WOMACK
(shaking her head)
Missiles detonated prior to impact. Target remains intact, sir.
CARTER
It looks like it's being protected by a shield. Defensive
capabilities must have been added.
PENDERGAST
Okay, now what?
INT--RAND PROTECTORATE BUNKER
RAND TECHNICIAN
Shields are holding.
PERNAUX
Recommend firing a warning shot.
NADAL
We have been attacked, Commander. We must respond in kind. Target
the ship.
[Pernaux nods to the technician. He adjusts a dial.]
RAND TECHNICIAN
The Earth vessel has been targeted. Weapon's primed and ready.
PERNAUX
Fire.
[The soldier flips a safety switch and presses the toggle to deploy the
weapon.]
EXT--SPACE, ABOVE TEGALUS
[The satellite fires a steady energy burst at Prometheus. The weapon
cuts through the shields and goes straight through one of the forward
sections of the ship, coming out the other side.]
INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE
[Sparks fly and everyone is jolted as the ship suddenly lists to
starboard. One of the personnel at a forward station is struck in the
face by sparks and falls to the floor. Teal'c rushes to help the
injured crew member. Crew members shout orders at each other as they
try and regain control.]
PENDERGAST
(shouting)
Evasive maneuvers! Full military thrust! Return fire with forward
rail guns.
WOMACK
Sublight engines aren't responding!
[She leaves her station and replaces the injured crew member. Carter
takes her place at the starboard command console.]
MARKS
Weapons are down! We've lost hull integrity and life support on
decks three through seven!
PENDERGAST
Seal them off!
MITCHELL

Sensors detect that the weapon is recharging!
MITCHELL
We've only got minutes.
PENDERGAST

WOMACK
Hyperdrive is offline!
CARTER
Hull integrity is too unstable.
MARKS
Medical teams reporting four casualties. Eight crew members still
unaccounted for.
MITCHELL

That thing can only fire at one target at a time.
PENDERGAST
Go! Scramble Blue Squadron!
MITCHELL

PENDERGAST
Lieutenant, I need sublight engines now!
WOMACK
I'm trying, sir! Auxiliary systems aren't kicking in!
CARTER
They can't. The two main power relays have been damaged!
[Carter moves to the side display.]
PENDERGAST
Can it be repaired?
[The display shows a diagram of the ship. Carter presses some buttons
to highlight a section.]
CARTER
We need to reroute power through the bypass conduits, here. We
should get limited sublight capability back.
PENDERGAST
Marks, you're with Colonel Carter. Go!

no longer following her and doubles back.]
CARTER
Captain! The elevator's not safe!
MARKS
Right. Sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.

NADAL
Your planet sent this ship to attack us. I have no desire to take
more lives. You tell us what we want to know, I will accept their
surrender.
PERNAUX
Who else was involved in this attack? What other actions are the
Caledonians planning?
DANIEL
We're not spies. I came here to convince your people to dismantle
this weapon yourselves before any of this became necessary!
NADAL
Why would we do that?
DANIEL
(swallowing his irritation)
I have tried to explain.
PERNAUX
(to Kane)
Who helped you gain access to the Stargate?
KANE
I acted alone.
NADAL
You are lying. You are part of a spy network helping to supply the
Caledonians with classified information!
DANIEL
Did you ever think that maybe the Caledonians are being leaked
information because not everyone in your country agrees with what
you're doing?
RAND TECHNICIAN
The weapon is charged.
[Nadal gives Daniel a furious look before moving to the soldier's
station.]
DANIEL
(frantically)
Wait! Please! Just listen to me before you go murdering defenseless
people!
NADAL
(furious)
We are the ones defending ourselves! Your ship attacked us!

We don't have it, Sam, I'm sorry. It's over. Give me as much power
as you can. Re-route it from the shields. And get me all functioning
internal Asgard beam sensors back online.
CARTER
(over radio)
Sir?
PENDERGAST
(into radio)
We're abandoning ship.
[Pendergast moves to Womack's station.]
PENDERGAST
Begin the evacuation orders. I want all personnel to beam down to
the planet's surface. Find me a nice open field anywhere in
Caledonia.
WOMACK
Yes, sir.
PENDERGAST
And broadcast the locations of all the active sensor sites.

Affirmative, Prometheus.

watch Pendergast. Pendergast physically removes Womack from her
station.]
PENDERGAST
I'll handle all the final transport commands. Everyone else is to
report to the nearest beam out site. Let's go, people! THAT'S AN
ORDER! MOVE!

Daniel. Daniel is turned away from Kane, his head down, completely
closed off in grief. He does not even look up when the outer door
clangs open and Pernaux approaches. He stands outside Daniel's cell,
but Daniel does not react.]
PERNAUX
(to Daniel)
The loss of your people is...regrettable. But your planet and the
Caledonians must know our resolve.
KANE
You know full well the Caledonians would rather sacrifice themselves
then submit. You'll be forced to commit genocide and destroy them.
[Pernaux moves to stand in front of Kane's cell.]
PERNAUX
A year ago they launched a first strike against us. They obviously
had no problem with doing the same.
KANE
(rising and approaching)
When does it stop?!? When do we stop killing each other over wars
started by our fathers and their fathers before them?
PERNAUX
This is no longer about Rand or Caledonia.
KANE
It is. We need to set aside our differences and fight the threat of
the Ori together. Goran, how long have we known each other?
Please...believe what Doctor Jackson has told you about them.
[Pernaux glances over at Daniel and sighs. Daniel has not moved at all,
even to lift his head.]
PERNAUX
With my own eyes, I saw the Prior bring the satellite to life merely
by touching it with his staff. Neither Rand nor Caledonia have the
technology capable of resisting such power. What choice do we have?
[Daniel finally reacts to this new information on the Prior. He sighs,
still obviously distraught, and approaches.]
DANIEL
Ah, look, I can't make you any promises, but we have already
developed a machine that neutralizes the Prior's powers. Now, as far
as we know, they've only been able to travel within our galaxy by
use of the Stargate, and you can either bury your Gate, or we can
teach you to build an iris system like ours.
KANE
Nadal has lost all sense of reason. The Book of Origin is just one
big lie meant to seduce us into meaningless worship. The Ori just
want to use us, and killing in their name is not self-defense. It's
murder.
[Pernaux is visibly concerned as he considers their words.]
EXT--CALEDONIAN CAPITAL CITY, TEGALUS, DAY

century Earth. Military personnel sit at desks trying to gather
information from telephone-like objects. Minister Chaska, Mitchell, and
Teal'c walk through the room.]
CHASKA
We were monitoring the entire exchange. To our knowledge,
seventy-six crew were recovered in Caledonian territory.
MITCHELL
There were over a hundred and fifteen people aboard that ship!
CHASKA
Do you have any sort of a manifest, a list of names we can compare
to those recovered?
MITCHELL
(upset)
Not on me, no. So where are our people?
CHASKA
The transport arrived moments ago.
[Carter enters and heads towards them.]
CARTER
Teal'c! Cameron!
MITCHELL
Sam! You are a sight for sore eyes.
[Mitchell embraces her, obviously relieved. After their release, she
turns to Teal'c. He grasps her by the upper arms and stares at her
closely, visibly moved to find her alive and well. She gives him a weak
smile in return.]
TEAL'C
(with great emotion)
It is good to see you, Colonel Carter. We feared the worst.
MITCHELL
Where's Pendergast?
[Carter fights back tears to maintain a stoic face and shakes her
head.]
CARTER
He wasn't with us.
[Mitchell and Teal'c exchange somber looks.]
CHASKA
(sympathetically)
Our security forces did extensive sweeps of the area where you
appeared. No other survivors were found.
MITCHELL
This is Minister Chaska, leader of the Caledonian Federation.
[Carter and Chaska exchange a handshake.]
CHASKA
I'm thankful you survived such a tragic event, Colonel. I hope we
can offer you and your crew some comfort here.
MITCHELL
(low to Carter)
She's pretty much up to speed on what's going on.
CHASKA
We were, of course, praying for your success. But, with the
destruction of your vessel, I fear that any hope for a peaceful
solution to this crisis has been lost.
TEAL'C
And you will not surrender?
CHASKA
Our people would rather die than live under Rand rule. We will
retaliate against any attack with the full forces at our disposal.
[Teal'c nods and bows in acknowledgment. Mitchell and Carter exchange
looks.]
INT--CALEDONIAN INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS
[Caledonian soldiers move about, checking files and monitoring
equipment. Carter stands by a table, looking over more detailed
schematics of the satellite. Chaska, Mitchell and Teal'c join her.]
CARTER
Any word?
MITCHELL
Nothing.
TEAL'C
The Rand government continues to deny any knowledge of Daniel
Jackson's existence.
CHASKA
Our contacts tell us he was seen alive in the Rand command bunker
during the exchange with your ship. He has not been seen since.
[Mitchell and Carter exchange identical looks, gritting their teeth.]
MITCHELL
Any progress here?
CARTER
Well, these satellite schematics are far more detailed than the ones
Kane provided. As we saw first-hand, shields were added late in the
design process. I--I'm still not sure what's powering it or how it
was able to penetrate our Asgard-designed shields. But, there is one
bit of good news. According to this, all commands for the satellite
originate from Rand's main control facility. And maintaining a
shield around the satellite is a huge power drain, so it's only
activated when a threat is detected.
MITCHELL
Are you saying the Prometheus was destroyed because we hesitated to
fire when we dropped out of hyperspace?
TEAL'C
We hesitated out of concern for the safe return of Daniel Jackson.
CARTER
We also hesitated to leave once our weapons were ineffective.
TEAL'C
However, it seems that you are saying if we were to destroy the Rand
control facility, the weapon itself would become vulnerable to
attack.
MITCHELL
Then we could take a 302 back up there and finish the job.
CHASKA
No, the Rand facility is part of an underground bunker complex that
was strong enough to survive our last missile attack. Since then,
Rand has developed an early-warning radar system and anti-missile
defenses.
[Chaska starts to leave.]
MITCHELL
Wait up! What about sabotage? You said you had people on the inside.
CHASKA
Our agents have already made several attempts. Security is too tight
for them to mount any sort of effective strike.
CARTER
Actually, we don't have to hit the bunker itself to knock out
satellite control. If we can sever the link between the facility and
the weapon, even temporarily...
MITCHELL
You're talking about an E.M. pulse.
CARTER
Even a small one detonated in the atmosphere above the facility
should interfere with their ability to control the satellite.
CHASKA
E.M. pulse?
MITCHELL
It would disable their electronic devices. They'd be totally blind.
CARTER
For a short time.
CHASKA
You possess such technology?
[Carter hesitates, licking her lips.]
MITCHELL
(studying Carter)
You wouldn't have suggested it if you didn't have something in mind.
CARTER
Well, like most discoveries, it was a bit of an accident. After the
battle with Anubis's fleet over Antarctica, small, random E.M.
fields were detected by Prometheus during the clean-up. It took us a
while to figure out.
MITCHELL
Are you going to tell me that an F-302 gives off an E.M. pulse when
it blows up?
CARTER
It was one of the things I was working on at Area 51. We think it
has something to do with a concussive force interfering with the
artificial gravity field generated by the inertial dampeners.
MITCHELL
So how do we remote fly a 302 over there and blow it up?
CARTER
(smiling)
We don't have to! All we have to do is harvest the inertial dampener
and rig it to one of the Caledonian missiles.
CHASKA
What about the anti-missile defenses?
CARTER
We use that same 302's radar jamming technology to make your missile
invisible to Rand.
CHASKA
Still, if this does not work as you're planning, it will be seen as
an offensive against Rand. President Nadal will surely respond by
stepping up the deadline for our surrender. And he'll use the
satellite weapon against us.
[Carter swallows and nods soberly.]
CARTER
(confidently)
This will work.
[Chaska swallows, concerned.]

DANIEL
Look, right now, I just have to believe that there are survivors.
KANE
You think that's really possible?
DANIEL
(sighing)
The Prometheus has beaming technology.
KANE
Had beaming technology. Whatever that is.
[He turns and sits on his bench.]
DANIEL

Look, the bottom line is we can't lose focus on why we came back
here in the first place. I mean, there has to be a way out of this,
and I got the feeling Pernaux was listening to us.
KANE
Daniel...
DANIEL
(speaking quickly)
Look, I--I know the history between Caledonia and Rand makes things
seem impossible, but sometimes an outside perspective helps. In the
past, I've found the key to these types of disputes is to--to get
both parties on equal footing, just to--to get the process of
talking with each other going.

Do you ever give up?
DANIEL
(sighing)
Not until I'm dead....And, sometimes, not even then.

PERNAUX
Possibly a test, then.

CARTER
Doesn't look like they've employed counter-measures. The radar
jamming is working.

The timing is too coincidental. I suspect he has spies who witnessed
the launch.

You need to stall, or else they'll activate the satellite shield out
of sheer paranoia.

The launch was entirely accidental. It seems there was some
confusion when new launch protocol codes were distributed recently.

but still looking skeptical.]

[He opens a can and sets it in front of Daniel, then sits in a
neighboring stool and opens his own can. Daniel studies the can
thoughtfully.]
DANIEL
So, where you been?
MITCHELL
I, um...hand-delivered Landry's letter to Colonel Pendergast's wife
and kids. They needed to know that he died saving his crew...that
his death mattered.
DANIEL
(pensive)
Well, seventy-six people survived. That's a--a testament to his
leadership.
MITCHELL
And yours. We never would've got off that planet if you hadn't
brokered the deal.
[He toasts Daniel with his can and takes a swig of beer. Daniel
grimaces and leans back in his chair.]
DANIEL
So, I take it, then, you haven't heard.
[Mitchell looks up.]
MITCHELL
Heard what?
DANIEL
Soon after we left, the talks broke down.
[Daniel looks away, then back at Mitchell sadly. Mitchell sighs and
looks down.]
MITCHELL
And?
DANIEL
And we've been unable to make contact with them. General Landry had
the Daedalus reroute on its way back from Atlantis. It seems the
Caledonians weren't content to just leave their fair planet.
[He gives a sad, ironic smile.]
MITCHELL
They launched an attack.
DANIEL
(nodding)
And Rand responded. The Stargate is presumed buried in the rubble.
[Mitchell shakes his head and stares into space.]
MITCHELL
Rough day.
[Daniel picks up his beer.]
DANIEL
Rough day.
[He makes a half-hearted toasting gesture with his beer can, which
Mitchell acknowledges, and they both drink.]
FADE OUT
