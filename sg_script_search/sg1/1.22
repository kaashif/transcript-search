   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN TUNNEL ENTRANCE, DAY

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is feeding pages into a paper shredder one sheet at a time.
   O'Neill arrives at Hammond's doorway.]

     O'NEILL
     Got a minute, sir?

     HAMMOND
     C'mon in, Jack. Have a seat. Ya know, I never anticipated how much
     paperwork is involved in shutting down a facility. Not exactly the
     last brave act I wanted to do before retiring.

     O'NEILL
     So you're still just gonna throw it in, huh?

     HAMMOND
     Well I was a month away from retirement before we started the SGC.
     The only thing that kept me here was...well, let's face it, it was a
     pretty wild ride.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir. Personally, I don't think we should be getting off that
     ride just yet.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, we've been through this. I agree with you, but we have our
     orders.

     O'NEILL
     They're ill-conceived orders, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I agree, but they're orders just the same, and I for one follow
     orders.

     O'NEILL
     Even though we are the only line of defense protecting this planet?

     HAMMOND
     I know that.

     O'NEILL
     I know you know that, sir. You're still just going to chuck it, huh?

     HAMMOND
     You don't think I tried everything to prevent this shutdown? I went
     back to Senator Kinsey twice. The second time, he had me forcibly
     removed from his office. I went to the Secretary of Defense, the
     Joint Chiefs. Hell, I finally called the President himself.

     O'NEILL
     What'd he say?

     HAMMOND
     He said that to override the Senate committee on this one would be
     political suicide for him.

   [O'Neill shakes his head.]

     HAMMOND
     It's over, Jack. No extensions, no reversals, no new hearings. The
     Stargate will be buried literally and figuratively.

   INT--VIEW OF STARGATE FROM SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The Stargate is covered with white fabric.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel turns as O'Neill enters. Carter and Teal'c are there as well.]

     O'NEILL
     Hammond's given up. They're going to bury the 'gate day after
     tomorrow.

     TEAL'C
     Then I must return through the Stargate as soon as possible.

     DANIEL
     Yes, we all should go through the 'gate as soon as possible.

     CARTER
     Whoa whoa whoa, go through, to where?

     DANIEL
     To the coordinates I got in the other reality.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, dammit!

     DANIEL
     Jack--it was real.

     CARTER
     Hey, even if it was, how do we know that that address correlates
     with this reality?

     DANIEL
     Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?

     TEAL'C
     We should enter the coordinates and attempt to open the 'gate.

     CARTER
     Okay, hold on. Has anyone considered that we would be in gross
     violation of orders? Sir, we would be court martialed the second we
     got back.

     O'NEILL
     If. If we got back.

     DANIEL
     Jack, if we don't go through, what I saw in the other reality could
     happen here. This whole planet could be wiped out. Now in the other
     reality, by the time I left, Sara was dead, Carter, your whole
     family was dead, hell, I was dead. Everyone was dead.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, I got it.

     DANIEL
     Okay, well don't you think we should see if we can stop the same
     slaughter from happening here? Let me ask you something, Jack. If we
     don't go through now, and the Goa'uld do attack later, how are you
     gonna to feel?

     CARTER
     How are just the four of us going to stop the attack anyway, even if
     we do go through?

     DANIEL
     Well, we'd have a lot better chance now than we would trying to stop
     an overwhelming onslaught later. Trust me--I have seen it.

     TEAL'C
     If the coordinates are for a Goa'uld world which is not on the
     Abydos cartouche, the Goa'uld will most likely not expect us. I
     believe a medical attack could be successful.

     O'NEILL
     Surgical attack, Teal'c. It's called a surgical attack, and I'd feel
     like an idiot.

     CARTER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     I was answering Daniel's question. If we don't do something now, and
     they do attack later, I'd feel like an idiot. We go.

     TEAL'C
     I too will go.

   [Carter hesitates.]

     O'NEILL
     It's not an order, Captain.

     CARTER
     I understand that, Colonel. Thank you. I'm going.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The Stargate opens. SG-1 is dressed in black BDU's and gear, viewed
   behind the glass of the control room, at computers. Gate activation
   alarm is sounding.]

     RECORDED VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
     Attention all personnel: unauthorized Stargate activation.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, close the blast doors and corridors to Alpha and Charlie.
     Disable 'em.

     CARTER
     I need an authorized officer's security code to disable.

   [O'Neill types into a computer.]

     O'NEILL
     There you go.

   [Carter types into a computer.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Armed troops are running through the corridor, then turn down another
   corridor.]

     AIRMAN'S VOICE
     Go! Go! Go!

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Hammond, Ferretti and more troops are walking. They see corridor A-2
   get closed off as door descends. Hammond swipes his security card
   through reader. Nothing happens.]

     FERRETTI
     It's on security lock-out, sir.

     HAMMOND

     Well, get it open, Major. Now. (to another soldier)
     Try going around through corridor C.

     SOLDIER
     Yes, sir. Move out! Corridor C.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     O'NEILL
     All right, MALP's on its way.

     CARTER
     Should reach its destination in 3...2...1.

   [The MALP video image on the computer screen is black.]

     O'NEILL
     What happened? We lose signal?

     CARTER
     No, sir. We are receiving video. Point of arrival is dark. Switching
     to infrared.

   [Infrared image shows a DHD and some large crates.]

     DANIEL
     Looks ancient Egyptian.

     TEAL'C
     Possibly Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     No signs of life in the immediate vicinity of the probe.

     RECORDED VOICE
     Security breached.

   [Daniel looks up at an overhead screen.]

     DANIEL
     They just got corridor C-9 open.

     O'NEILL
     All right, let's go.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 rushes into the Gate Room. They run up the ramp and go through
   the Stargate. Hammond and Ferretti enter with troops just as Teal'c
   enters the wormhole.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--GATE ROOM ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [O'Neill is scanning the room using night-vision goggles. He removes
   them and turns on a flashlight, as do the others. There is no light
   except for that from the flashlights.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, send back the MALP.

     CARTER
     Doesn't look like there are any doors or windows.

     TEAL'C
     Many Goa'uld facilities disguise doorways within their structure.

   [Daniel begins to dial Earth. O'Neill is shining his flashlight on a
   crate.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey Teal'c, what are these things?

     TEAL'C
     Transport containers. Much like your shipping crates.

     CARTER
     So they're shipping something through the 'gate?

     TEAL'C
     Or receiving.

     O'NEILL
     Let's have a look inside, shall we?

   [The Stargate activates. Daniel commands the MALP to move toward it,
   and it does. Teal'c opens a crate.]

     O'NEILL
     Cool. What are these things?

   [The crate interior shows two staff weapons and some smaller devices.
   Teal'c picks up one of the smaller devices.]

     TEAL'C
     This is a Goa'uld zat'nik'tel. A weapon using a different form of
     energy less powerful than that of a staff weapon. Less destructive
     but still quite deadly.

   [The Stargate disengages.]

     O'NEILL
     Sweet. Pass 'em out. What'd you call it?

     TEAL'C
     Zat'nik'tel.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Let's call it a zat gun, huh? How do you fire it?

     TEAL'C
     One need only squeeze it here to fire.

   [O'Neill does as instructed and extends the zat to the ready position.]

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld take great pleasure in discharging the weapon only once
     on a subject, causing him great pain, disabling but not killing him.
     A second shot will kill most subjects.

     CARTER
     Nice.

   [A whining noise begins and builds in intensity.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell's that?

     CARTER
     What's happening, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I am unsure.

   [The sound continues to build, then there is a clunk and a shimmering
   and everyone except Teal'c goes flying across the room. Daniel falls
   down the stairs in front of the Gate and lands face down. Daniel and
   O'Neill start to move.]

     O'NEILL
     Everybody okay?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, what was that?

     CARTER
     Felt like some kind of weird planetary shift.

     TEAL'C
     We should dial home immediately.

     O'NEILL
     Do it, Daniel.

   [Daniel dials Earth and hits the center activation crystal, but the DHD
   glyph lights go out and nothing happens at the Stargate.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     What? I dialed home just like I did a minute ago, just like I've
     done a million times before.

     O'NEILL
     Well, do it again.

   [Daniel dials again, and again nothing happens.]

     DANIEL
     Uh oh.

   [A door to the room begins to open. SG-1 takes cover around the room.
   Six Jaffa march in. Daniel sees that he left his night-vision goggles
   on the floor. The Jaffa open a crate and a large metallic sphere floats
   out of it over to the Stargate. The Jaffa march out, leaving the sphere
   suspended inside the Stargate circle. SG-1 comes out of hiding. The
   door closes, but the lights in the room remain on.]

     O'NEILL
     I always get a happy tingly feeling when I see those guys.

   [Daniel retrieves his goggles and looks at the sphere.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c, what is this?

     TEAL'C
     It is a Goa'uld long-range visual communication device. Somewhat
     like your television, only much further advanced.

     O'NEILL
     Think it gets Showtime? Can you open that door?

     TEAL'C
     Now that I know its location, I believe I can.

   [Teal'c gets the door open. They move into the corridor. The doors
   close behind them. They hide from the Jaffa going the other way, then
   move out down the corridor.]

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, we've confirmed that it was SG-1. They went to the coordinates
     that Doctor Jackson brought back with him from that...other place.

     HAMMOND
     If what he was saw was indeed real, that's the origination point of
     the Goa'uld military attack on Earth.

     HARRIMAN
     A pretty hostile place to go, wouldn't it sir.

     FERRETTI
     Do you want SG-2 to go get them, bring them back, sir?

     HAMMOND
     You'd only be bringing them back for courts martial.

     FERRETTI
     Permission to speak freely, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Go ahead.

     FERRETTI
     Sir, Colonel O'Neill saved my butt more than once. I'd like to go in
     and back him up.

     HAMMOND
     I can't send your unit in --

     FERRETTI
     My men and I are willing to take the risk, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I'll take that under advisement, Major.

   INT--CORRIDOR ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [SG-1 is moving carefully along the corridor and make their way into a
   room.]

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [There is a sarcophagus in the room. They search the room.]

     DANIEL
     A sarcophagus.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, great. More snakeheads. Teal'c, any idea which one's in here?
     Teal'c?

   [Teal'c is looking at something; the rest join him.]

     CARTER
     We're not on a planet, are we?

     TEAL'C
     That is correct.

   [The camera reveals a view screen showing a wormhole-like image.]

     TEAL'C
     It appears we are aboard a Goa'uld transport vessel.

     CARTER
     And that jolt was...

     TEAL'C
     Hyperlaunch.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Stargate ring is spinning. A technician is preparing a MALP.]

     HARRIMAN

     (voice off-camera)
     Chevron four encoded.

     HAMMOND
     You'll proceed much like SG-1 did. We'll send the MALP through
     first. If it's clear, you'll go through immediately.

     FERRETTI
     Yes, sir.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron five encoded.

     HAMMOND
     I'd like to reemphasize, Major, that officially your primary mission
     is to bring back SG-1 for court martial.

     FERRETTI
     Yes, sir.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron six encoded.

     HAMMOND
     Major, bring them back alive and well.

     FERRETTI
     That's my plan, sir.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron seven...will not lock.

     HAMMOND
     What happened, Sergeant?

     HARRIMAN
     I'm sorry, sir. I--I don't know.

     HAMMOND
     Well, find out.

   EXT--KLOREL'S SHIP TRAVELING THROUGH HYPERSPACE

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, why didn't you tell us we were on a ship?

     TEAL'C
     I was not sure. I have never been aboard a Goa'uld vessel such as
     this. Most accelerate very differently. Most do not contain
     Stargates.

   [A Jaffa enters, aiming a zat at O'Neill. The rest take cover, unseen
   by the Jaffa.]

     JAFFA
     Tel-ko-nak!

     O'NEILL
     Hey! How ya doin'? Uh, seen a bathroom around here?

   [O'Neill ducks as the Jaffa fires his zat; the shot hits the view
   screen and disperses. Carter comes out from hiding and zats the Jaffa
   twice. Teal'c zats him a third time, making his body disappear.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay, one shot hurts 'em, two shots kill 'em. The third shot...

     TEAL'C
     Disintegrates him.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, great. You didn't feel this was worthy of mention, I take it.

   [Carter gestures at the view screen.]

     CARTER
     The blast spread across this area like there was glass here. This is
     a force field of some sort.

     TEAL'C
     That is correct. There is no transparent material capable of
     withstanding this velocity.

     CARTER
     Or temporal displacement. We're traveling faster than light, right?

     TEAL'C
     That is correct.

     CARTER
     So the ship must have been in orbit around a planet when we 'gated
     here. Then it--it launched or left orbit, which would explain why we
     can't 'gate home.

     DANIEL
     The point of origin isn't valid anymore.

     CARTER
     Right.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I suggest the two of you figure out how to get us back home.

     CARTER
     Sir, the only way to that would be to turn this thing around and go
     back to where we started.

     DANIEL
     Right, I'll just go tell the pilot.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you know how to fly one of these things?

     TEAL'C

     Of this I am unsure. It appears to be of a new technology.

     O'NEILL
     So, you couldn't turn this tub around, I take it.

     TEAL'C
     I am qualified only to pilot the Goa'uld death gliders. I suggest we
     relocate to another chamber as soon as possible. Royal sarcophagi
     are rarely left unattended for long.

   [They leave the room and make their way through the corridor. Jaffa
   approach while they hide. The Jaffa pass by. SG-1 enters a new room;
   O'Neill watches the passing Jaffa through a hole in the wall.]

   INT--GLIDER HANGAR ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     DANIEL
     Jack? It's happening.

   [A hangar full of death gliders being prepared for launch is revealed.]

     DANIEL
     We're on an attack ship headed to Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Well, we've got some problems then.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, how fast can this ship go?

     TEAL'C
     A Goa'uld ha'tak vessel can travel at ten times the speed of light.

     CARTER
     Okay, so if we are heading to Earth, then we have a long time.

     O'NEILL
     Based on what?

     CARTER
     Based on the coordinates of the planet we gated to.

     O'NEILL
     We didn't gate to a planet, we gated to a ship.

     CARTER
     Yeah, but that ship had to have been in orbit around or on the
     surface of a planet in order for those 'gate coordinates to work.
     So, based on the location of those coordinates, even if we were
     traveling at ten times the speed of light, it would take at least a
     year to get to Earth, probably more.

     LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
     Mol jaffa. Tim lokeem rel roconnai.

   [The Jaffa leave the hangar.]

     DANIEL
     They're being summoned to some sort of gathering.

   [They watch Jaffa pass in the corridor from a small hole in the wall.
   The Jaffa are moving the sarcophagus along the corridor.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay, let's go.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute. Go where?

     O'NEILL
     Wherever they're goin'.

   [Teal'c opens door to corridor. They move out.]

   INT--GATE ROOM ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [The sarcophagus is in this room now. Jaffa, female acolytes and
   priests are gathered around it. The large metallic sphere hanging
   inside the Stargate comes to life, revealing a live image of Apophis.]

     APOPHIS
     Chel hol, Jaffa. The end of a dark moment in Goa'uld history
     approaches. Soon we will wipe out the scourge that plagues us. I
     will rejoin you as we come out of the shadows. Until then, you are
     to follow all orders of my son, as if they were my own.

   [SG-1 has sneaked into the room and remain in hiding. The sarcophagus
   opens.]

     APOPHIS
     Bow down now. Show me your reverence for my son. The mighty warrior,
     Klorel!

   [Klorel stands up in the sarcophagus.]

     KLOREL
     Tel kol, Jaffa. Kel, Apophis. Re nek Klorel.

     APOPHIS
     Re nek, Klorel.

   [O'Neill is troubled that Klorel is Skaara.]

   EXT--KLOREL'S SHIP TRAVELING THROUGH HYPERSPACE

   INT--GATE ROOM ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [SG-1 is hiding behind a container as last Jaffa leave.]

     O'NEILL
     He called him his son. That's sick!

     CARTER
     Not exactly a chip off the old block.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld inside Skaara is probably the son of the one inside
     Apophis.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Daniel, that's encouraging.

     CARTER
     I'm just tryin' to help.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, what is our plan of attack?

     O'NEILL
     We're going to split up. Carter, you and Daniel start plantin' C4
     all over this ship.

     DANIEL
     And what are you and Teal'c going to do?

     O'NEILL
     We're going to try and grab Skaara.

     CARTER
     Sir, are you sure? It-it would be like trying to take Apophis.

     TEAL'C
     They do not know we are aboard. There would be little reason to keep
     him under heavy guard.

     CARTER
     Okay, but with respect, sir, I think you're making an emotional
     decision here.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe, but it's also the best strategic decision.

     CARTER
     Is it?

     DANIEL
     Jack has a point. If we can capture him, maybe we can get through to
     the old Skaara. Kendra said that she could fight past her Goa'uld
     when it was still inside of her.

     O'NEILL
     Let's go.

     CARTER
     Sir. Contingency plan.

     O'NEILL
     C-4.

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [O'Neill and Teal'c burst in, fighting Jaffa using Zats. They take out
   all the Jaffa. Klorel prepares his ribbon device. Teal'c grabs him from
   behind.]

     KLOREL
     Chel nok, makor.

     TEAL'C
     Rin nok.

   [Teal'c takes the ribbon device off of Klorel.]

     KLOREL
     You dare to do this to Klorel? You will die a painful death.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, yeah, whatever.

     TEAL'C
     There's a raised hieroglyphic on the wall next to the door. It
     resembles a coiled serpent. Push, then turn it.

   [O'Neill does so, and the door closes.]

     TEAL'C
     Stand aside.

   [Teal'c zats the raised symbol, fusing it into place. O'Neill does the
   same to the symbol for the only other door after closing it.]

     TEAL'C
     They will not be able to access this room for some time.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, Skaara. Long time, no see.

   INT--CORRIDOR ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Carter and Daniel are moving down the corridor. They duck into the
   hangar to avoid Jaffa troops.]

     CARTER
     All right. Those things have to be fueled by something, and fuel is
     usually combustible, so...

     DANIEL
     So if we blow up one, we'll probably start a chain reaction.

     CARTER
     Right.

   [Carter moves in and sets a charge on one of the death gliders.]

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     O'NEILL
     C'mon, Skaara, think. Try to remember me, I'm Jack O'Neill; this is
     Teal'c.

     KLOREL
     Ah, Teal'c, the traitor. I will take great pleasure in delivering
     his head to my father.

     O'NEILL
     He's not your father.

     KLOREL
     He is my father. He seeded the queen mother. He chose the host in
     which I will live out eternity. Apophis gave me life.

     O'NEILL
     All right, I'm not talkin' to that thing in your head. I'm talking
     to Skaara.

     KLOREL
     Nothing of the host survives.

     O'NEILL
     That's bullshit. Now let him talk to me.

     KLOREL
     Your friend had a feeble mind. It suffered greatly and gave in
     easily.

   [Klorel laughs. O'Neill slugs Klorel in the jaw.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF PELTAC

   [Jaffa are working on control panel and trying to get the door to
   open.]

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     O'NEILL
     C'mon Skaara. Look at me. Try.

     KLOREL
     Perhaps I will not kill you. Perhaps you will make a good host
     yourself.

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     All right, promise me this thing won't kill him.

     TEAL'C
     Two shots will. One shot will only cause him great pain.

     O'NEILL
     So here's the deal. Let him out, let him talk to me, or you get the
     whole load.

     KLOREL
     You will only hurt your friend.

     O'NEILL
     He's a tough kid.

     KLOREL
     Your friend is too afraid to come forward. He enjoys my protection.
     He really does not wish to speak with you.

     O'NEILL
     Is that right? Let him go, Teal'c. Let him go.

   [Teal'c steps away. O'Neill fires on Klorel, who falls in pain.]

     SKAARA
     Sha'uri! Daniel!

   [Teal'c holds Skaara while O'Neill kneels in front of him.]

     O'NEILL
     Skaara. Hey there.

     SKAARA
     O'Neill! Oh, it hurts.

     O'NEILL
     I know, kid. I'm sorry.

     SKAARA
     O'Neill, are you still my friend?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I am.

     SKAARA
     Can you forgive me for what we are about to do?

     O'NEILL
     What are you about to do? Skaara! Skaara, what are you about to do?

     SKAARA
     Please forgive us.

     O'NEILL
     Hang in there kid, c'mon, hang on! What are you about to do?

     KLOREL
     Jaffa! Nok kree tol!

   [Teal'c and O'Neill restrain Klorel. Jaffa get the door open and storm
   in.]

     JAFFA
     Drop your weapon. Release Klorel now.

     O'NEILL
     C'mon Skaara, help us.

     JAFFA
     Release him, or we will kill the human.

     TEAL'C
     If you kill the human I will kill Klorel.

     JAFFA
     And the host in which he resides?

   [Teal'c lowers his zat to the floor. Klorel picks it up, steps behind
   O'Neill and zats him; he falls from his knees to the floor,
   unconscious. A Jaffa prepares to fire on him with a staff.]

     KLOREL
     Jaffa, nok!

   [The Jaffa stops.]

     KLOREL
     The traitor and his recruiter. My father will be pleased.

   INT--GATE ROOM ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     CARTER
     The naquadah in the 'gate will magnify the explosion.

   [Daniel is looking at the metal sphere.]

     DANIEL
     I'm just hopin' they can't see us through this thing.

   [The door to the room begins to open. Carter and Daniel move to hid
   behind the Stargate platform. Klorel enters, followed by O'Neill,
   Teal'c, and four Jaffa. Klorel kneels before the metal ball, and it
   comes to life with Apophis' face.]

     APOPHIS
     Shin'tel, Klorel.

     KLOREL
     Father, I wish to present you with a great gift. The traitor,
     Teal'c. And, I present the human that recruited him.

     O'NEILL
     Hey Pops.

     APOPHIS
     Silence! Klorel, where did they come from?

     KLOREL
     I do not know. We found them after departure.

     APOPHIS
     How many more came with you?

     O'NEILL
     Thousands. We brought a whole army.

     KLOREL
     I assure you, Father, there could be no more.

     APOPHIS
     You have made me proud, my son.

     KLOREL
     Do you wish that I keep them until our rejoining?

     APOPHIS
     No. Teal'c must suffer the most painful death a Jaffa can know.
     Removal of his prim'ta. Let his new master watch him suffer and die.

     KLOREL
     What about the human?

     APOPHIS
     You may choose his method of death, but do it soon. It is almost
     time for remoc.

     KLOREL
     Yes, Father.

     APOPHIS
     I look forward to seeing you at our destination. Lek tol.

   [Apophis' image fades from the sphere. A priest, two female acolytes,
   and more Jaffa enter. The priest unsheathes a two-pronged knife.]

     O'NEILL
     Skaara, don't let this happen. Don't let 'em do this.

     KLOREL
     Na-nay.

   [The priest stops.]

     KLOREL
     Take them to the peltac.

   [The Jaffa escort them out, followed by Klorel. Cater and Daniel stand
   up from where they were crouching behind the platform.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, we're going to go after them.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute, when are we going to blow the ship?

     CARTER
     We'll detonate only as a last resort.

     DANIEL
     Listen, I wanna save them as much as you do, but if we get captured
     or killed, there is going to be nobody left to blow this ship before
     it gets to Earth.

     CARTER
     That's why I'm setting a timer. If we don't deactivate it in 24
     hours, it'll go automatically. Okay?

     DANIEL
     Okay.

   INT--PELTAC ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Klorel and Jaffa arrive with O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     KLOREL
     You wish to go home to your planet?

     O'NEILL
     Of course.

     KLOREL
     Jaffa, krel tak remoc.

   [A Jaffa puts his hand on a small metal ball.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, prepare yourself for--

   [O'Neill goes flying into a control panel then sits up, rubbing his
   head.]

     TEAL'C
     Extreme deceleration.

     O'NEILL
     Thanks, Teal'c.

   [O'Neill looks at the view screen.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh my God.

   [The view screen shows that the ship is about to pass Saturn.]

     KLOREL
     You will get to see your home one last time, before you, and
     everyone on your planet, are destroyed. And your kind will disturb
     the Goa'uld no more.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN TUNNEL ENTRANCE, NIGHT

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, I think we have another situation. We just spoke with Cairn
     deep-space radar, and they picked up two large blips passing Saturn.
     They're heading towards Earth.

     HAMMOND
     Any identification yet?

     HARRIMAN
     Not yet, sir. NASA's just repositioning Hubble right now. Then we
     should be able to get a closer look.

     HAMMOND
     Guess Doctor Jackson is lucky.

     HARRIMAN
     How so, sir?

     HAMMOND
     He won't have to be around to watch his nightmare come true for a
     second time.

   [Hammond picks up the red phone.]

     HAMMOND
     This is Major General Hammond. Let me speak to the President.

   EXT--KLOREL'S SHIP TRAVELING THROUGH SOLAR SYSTEM

   INT--CORRIDOR ON KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Daniel and Carter are moving down the corridor, evading a large
   contingent of Jaffa. They follow the Jaffa to the glider bays. The
   cockpits of the gliders close, with pilots aboard.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond briefs his staff.]

     HAMMOND
     The President is mobilizing every branch, including the Guard and
     Reserve. The Air Force efforts will be coordinated through this
     facility. I need this room converted to a command and control center
     ASAP. Now make sure we have a link to AF SATCOM for encrypted
     communications to all Air Force bases and to NASA. Any more details
     on what we're facing?

     HARRIMAN
     Not yet, sir.

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP, CORRIDOR AND PELTAC

   [Carter and Daniel approach the peltac, where Jaffa are holding O'Neill
   and Teal'c captive. Carter sets off a smoke grenade in the corridor.
   Some Jaffa come to investigate, and Carter and Daniel fire on them,
   taking them out. They move into the peltac, and O'Neill and Teal'c join
   the fight in hand-to-hand combat. They take out all the Jaffa.]

   [Klorel grabs Daniel, whose gun skitters across the floor. Klorel then
   begins using the ribbon device on Daniel, who drops to his knees and
   grabs Klorel's arm, but to no effect. O'Neill grabs Daniel's fallen
   weapon.]

     O'NEILL
     Skaara! Skaara, don't!

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, you must take action!

     O'NEILL
     Skaara!

   [O'Neill shoots Klorel/Skaara twice with Daniel's pistol. Klorel falls,
   and O'Neill goes to his side.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, you okay?

   [Daniel is sitting up but is gasping and unable to answer.]

     SKAARA
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, Skaara, I'm sorry.

   [Skaara/Klorel smiles at O'Neill, then dies.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, gimme a second, here.

     TEAL'C
     I cannot.

   [They all look out of the view screen, O'Neill still kneeling by
   Skaara's body.]

     CARTER
     Earth.

     DANIEL
     I thought you said we couldn't be there for at least a year.

     CARTER
     I guess this ship can go way faster than ten times the speed of
     light.

   [They all gather to stand and look at the view screen.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, we saw the death gliders. They're prepping for launch, sir.
