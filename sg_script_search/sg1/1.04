TEASER
EXT--PLANET--DAY
[Carter runs out of the wormhole, which closes behind her. The planet
is green; tall trees surround the Gate. She joins O'Neill, Daniel and
Teal'c as they look around. Rocks and rubble are strewn all around.]
DANIEL
What a mess.
TEAL'C
This temple was destroyed long ago.
O'NEILL
Let's get a move on before we meet somebody who remembers why.
[O'Neill pulls on sunglasses. The team falls in behind him as they walk
away from the Stargate.]
EXT--FIELD--DAY
[Through binoculars, we see a meadow.]
DANIEL
There's no signs of human life.
TEAL'C
This could be some forbidden zone.
[There is a faint, distant sound of barking.]
CARTER
Wait, I hear something. It sounds like...dogs.
[O'Neill looks through the binoculars again. The sound of barking grows
louder. Suddenly, a figure appears, running over a hill. He looks
behind him. The barking increases.]
[The figure is a teenage boy, with long hair and exotic looking
clothing. He shouts as he runs; four large dogs come into view, chasing
him. They are jumping at the boy, grabbing his clothing.]
ABU
Ahh. Help! Help!
[O'Neill drops the binoculars, and SG-1 moves as one toward the running
boy. Abu has paused, surrounded by dogs. The dogs begin to jump on him,
tearing clothing.]
ABU
No! Help! No! Help me! Ahhh!
[Abu falls to his knees as the dogs pull him down.]
ABU
Ahhh! Ahhh! Help!
O'NEILL
(waving and shooting his gun a couple times)
Hey, get out of here!
[Startled, the dogs turn and run away. Abu stumbles to his feet,
turning to look at his rescuers. Teal'c and Carter run past him,
chasing the dogs away. O'Neill and Daniel stop beside him.]
O'NEILL
You okay?
[Abu looks confused.]
O'NEILL
Okay...o--?
ABU
Yes, I am. Thanks be to you. But forgive me. I am Abu of the
Shavadai.
DANIEL
Shavadai?
ABU
The people of the steppe.
DANIEL
Well...hello! I'm, uh, Daniel Jackson. This is...
O'NEILL
Jack.
DANIEL
Jack.
ABU
You are not...from the people of the river.
O'NEILL
Uh, no.
DANIEL
We're...we're travelers from very far away.
ABU
The sea of Ogada?
O'NEILL
(pauses, then nods)
S--sure.
ABU
(grins)
Never have we met anyone from that far away. You will be doubly
welcome in my father's camp.
DANIEL
(gestures to his teammates, approaching behind the boy)
This is Teal'c, and this is Dr. Carter.
TEAL'C
The dogs are gone.
CARTER
For now.
[Abu looks shocked as he takes in Carter's appearance. He ducks his
head and backs away from her, moving to stand, half-hidden behind
O'Neill.]
ABU
(whispers)
Is this a woman?
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah.
CARTER
What do...do I have something growing out of my nose, or...
[Carter takes a couple steps forward; Abu will not look at her. Daniel
observes Abu's attitude, then crosses to stand beside Carter.]
DANIEL
(to Carter)
He looks really upset. It must be some sort of cultural thing.
[Carter purses her lips, frowns, and moves to stand in front of Abu.]
ABU
(puts his hand up to stop her approach)
No! I cannot look at you.
CARTER
Okay, now I'm hurt.
[There's a sound of hooves, and three horses come up over the rise
where Abu first appeared. All three are carrying riders. Abu looks up.]
MAN
Shomo! Abu!
ABU
(to O'Neill, desperately)
You must take her. You must take her and go! Go!
[Daniel and Teal'c move to stand with Carter, Abu and O'Neill as the
horsemen ride down to them. Abu leaves the team and runs to greet the
newcomers.]
ABU
Raga, Raga. These people...they are from the Sea of Ogada!
HORSEMAN
(sounding incredulous)
One is a woman?
ABU
Yes.
DANIEL
(stunned)
Colonel, I think these people are Mongols.
O'NEILL
Is this good news?
CARTER
Daniel, find out what I did wrong so I can fix it.
[Raga dismounts, approaching the team. Abu jumps in front of him,
trying to hold him away.]
ABU
(pleading)
No, no...No, let them go.
[Daniel walks up to the man, looking back at Carter.]
DANIEL
He's right. We'll just take her with us and go.
[Raga pulls out a sword, pushing Abu and Daniel aside. The second
horseman pulls his sword, while the third pulls out a bow and nocks an
arrow, aiming at the team. Daniel, Teal'c, O'Neill and Carter stand in
place, looking grim.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--MEADOW--DAY
[It looks like a face-off, until O'Neill pulls out his pistol and fires
it into the air three times. The horses neigh, surprised at the sudden
sound; the horsemen shout in surprise as they work to control their
mounts. O'Neill waves his gun in the air, smirking. Raga pushes Abu
away, but now Teal'c has aimed his staff weapon at the group, O'Neill
has his pistol pointed at them, and Carter is aiming an MP-5.]
[Another horse carrying a man comes over the rise. He shouts, then
gallops the horse down the hill. As he approaches, the horsemen turn to
look at him, their weapons forgotten. The man comes to a halt between
the two groups. Abu runs up to place a hand on his saddle.]
MOUGHAL
My son. When you did not return, I feared you were dead.
ABU
I would be in a dog's stomach now, but for these.
[He points at SG-1. Moughal looks at the team; they have relaxed their
stance and weapons. He looks to his men with disapproval.]
MOUGHAL
Is this any way to greet a stranger?
RAGA
That one...
(he points at Carter)
...is a women.
O'NEILL
Observant bunch.
ABU
Father, they come from the Sea of Ogada; they do not know our ways.
MOUGHAL
(grimly)
Law is law.
(to O'Neill)
What manner of weapon is that?
CARTER
It's a firearm. It shoots like your bow shoots an arrow.
MOUGHAL
(angrily)
She speaks, she dies. Sut.
[Abu grabs at his father's horse, holding out his hand to stop the
warriors.]
ABU
No! No! She saved my life.
[Moughal stares at Carter, she stares back.]
MOUGHAL
If a women...saved a life, hers cannot be taken. Now, you're my
guests. If you will travel this country, you must learn our ways.
CARTER
(to her teammates)
I'm thinking we should just go back while we're ahead.
DANIEL
If we learn their customs, we'll be okay. It's an incredible
opportunity to study an ancient culture up close.
EXT--MONGOL VILLAGE--DAY
[A colorful array of tents is set up in a clearing. Fires burn outside
the tents. Llamas graze throughout the camp. SG-1 approaches the
village, walking beside the horsemen. Abu walks with them.]
VILLAGER
They return! They found Abu!
[A woman peers out of a tent. She spies Abu and smiles with relief. Abu
waves to her. Hooking a veil over her face, so that only her eyes are
showing, she runs from the tent to the approaching group.]
VILLAGERS
Abu! Abu! Abu!
ABU
Mother.
[The woman hugs Abu. Several other women come out from behind curtains,
approaching their visitors with curiosity. People cheer and laugh. A
woman grabs Carter and leads her into a large tent. Daniel, O'Neill and
Teal'c follow.]
DANIEL
This is unbelievable. Uh, the Mongols who settled on the Persian
China adapted to the local customs. But there was one tribe the
Chagatai that kept the traditional life of the steppe-nomad. Maybe
these Shavadai are their descendants. I mean...uh...this camp could
literally belong to Genghis Khan. It's a living exhibit of a way of
life that's been extinct for...nine hundred years.
[Moughal walks into the tent.]
MOUGHAL
Ah. Please sit.
[He hands his hat to his wife and smiles.]
MOUGHAL
(to Carter>
Now you may talk.
CARTER
Uh, good, 'cause I...I still don't understand what happened out
there.
MOUGHAL
Among our people, it is death for a woman to show her face in
public.
[Carter raises her eyebrows in disbelief.]
ABU
Or to wear the clothes of a man.
MOUGHAL
The old laws weigh heavily; it is well you saved Abu from the dogs.
It gave me a way to prevent your death.
[Moughal settles on a large, throne-like chair. Abu settles at his
feet.]
CARTER
Uh, thank you for that.
MOUGHAL
Soon, the old laws...ahh...the old ways will no longer serve us.
Trade will one day replace war. This is the future. We have
strongest, fastest horses and camels. The finest wool...
ABU
(looks at his father and raises a finger)
And medicines. Drugs of unheard of power.
O'NEILL
Oh, we've got some pretty swell drugs of our own.
CARTER
Well, uh, Colonel...a lot of breakthroughs in medicine are coming
out of the mountains, and the...the jungles. We should really see
what he's got.
[O'Neill nods.]
ABU
I will show you. Follow me.
[Carter moves to follow Abu, but Moughal's words stop her.]
MOUGHAL
I'm afraid...you cannot go until you are properly attired.
CARTER
(disbelieving)
"Properly attired?"
DANIEL
Uh, you should probably do what they want. Um, anthropologists do it
all the time. They...dress and live as the people they're studying.
CARTER
Well, I'm not an anthropologist.
O'NEILL
(grinning)
You are today.
[O'Neill laughs as he gets up, slapping Carter on the shoulder. Carter
grimaces as she looks at that shoulder.]
[Teal'c, O'Neill and Daniel exit the tent, following Abu. Carter
follows one of the women. She is brought to a small courtyard formed by
the backs of several tents. Inside, women are working on various
household chores, their faces uncovered. They all move to surround
Carter, curious.]
EXT--VILLAGE--DAY
[Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c look on as Abu speaks. He has a man sitting
before them, his upper chest exposed. There is a healing wound just
below his collarbone.]
ABU
I used the medicine on this wound from a fire arrow, in a recent
skirmish. The shoulder was badly burned. From the moment I began
treatment, there was no pain.
DANIEL
This could be an anesthetic we haven't seen before.
O'NEILL
We should take some back and test it.
DANIEL
Yeah.
EXT--VILLAGE--DAY
[Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill follow Abu through the camp. He leads them
into a tent. They stop, staring in astonishment.]
CARTER
Daniel, find me an anthropologist that dresses like this and I will
eat this headdress.
[All three men look at Carter, who is standing before them in one a
bright blue native dresses, and a beaded headdress with a white, silk
veil hanging to the side. It looks more like an outfit for special
occasions rather than for everyday wear. Daniel's mouth drops open.
O'Neill smirks. Teal'c just looks...appreciative.]
ABU
You are...the most beautiful women I have ever seen.
[Carter stares at him, speechless. Abu blinks, his gaze turning
thoughtful. He turns around and walks out.]
CARTER
(rolls her eyes)
Uh, I guess the kid doesn't get out much. Look, uh,
[She picks up the veil.]
CARTER
I will not wear this thing over my face. I don't care how much
embroidery it has on it. And this...dress, or whatever it's called,
I mean...I can't move, I can't walk...
O'NEILL
I don't know.
(shakes his head, smirking)
It...it kind of works for me. I, uh...
DANIEL
It's, it's you, it's...
[O'Neill and Daniel exchange looks; in the background Teal'c looks from
one to the other. O'Neill and Daniel turn to Carter and speak.]
O'NEILL
...you.
DANIEL
(a beat later)
Definitely you.
[Carter looks like she wants to kick them both; she puts her hands on
her hips and glares. O'Neill looks at Daniel and moves his finger in a
circular motion.]
DANIEL
(jumps)
Uh, uh the good news is...uh you were right. One of Abu's plants
seems to work as a...a...an anesthetic. We're taking some home to
be, uh, uh, analyzed.
O'NEILL
All things considered...Samantha...if we have to come back here, it
might be a better idea if we brought an all male team. No offence.
CARTER
Well, in view of the fact that you all get to go to this party
tonight and I get to stay in this...yurt that smells like rancid yak
butter, none taken. I'll just get a good night's sleep, and hope for
better luck next time.
[The men look uneasily at her, then at each other. There's a strange
sound from outside.]
O'NEILL
(whispers to Daniel)
Let's go.
DANIEL
(nods)
Yeah.
[He puts his hand to his lips, mouthing the words to Carter.]
DANIEL
Good night.
[Carter raises one hand in a half-hearted wave as O'Neill gestures
toward the door flap. Daniel and Teal'c walk out. O'Neill is about to
follow, but stops, smiling back.]
O'NEILL
You going to be all right?
CARTER
Still doubting me? I haven't been afraid of the dark since I was
two.
[O'Neill smiles, gesturing toward the dress.]
O'NEILL
You look great.
[Carter nods and O'Neill walks out, still smiling. Carter frowns,
looking around the tent.]
EXT--VILLAGE--NIGHT
[The party is in full swing, with drums going and men hooting. The men
sit or stand around a large fire. They're eating and drinking.]
INT--YURT--NIGHT
[Carter is asleep in her yurt, still wearing the blue dress. Out of the
dark, a hand shoots out and a knife is held to her throat. She wakes,
reaching for her gun beside the bed, but one of her attackers steps on
it.]
ATTACKER
Quiet!
[Carter refuses to stop; there is a struggle. As one man holds the
knife to her throat; another ties her hands and places a gag in her
mouth. She's lifted over someone's shoulder and taken out of the tent.]
INT--YURT--MORNING
[Daniel paces outside Carter's tent.]
DANIEL
Doctor, we're about ready to go.
[Daniel gives up on the pacing and walks into the tent, averting his
eyes.]
DANIEL
Doctor, we're about ready to...
[Daniel notices that Carter is gone, and registers the mess created in
the struggle. Carter's gun is still there even though she is not.]
DANIEL
...go.
EXT--WOODS--DAY
[Carter is seated on a rock, struggling with her bonds. Abu pulls the
veil away from her face, undoing the cloth tied over her mouth so that
Carter can spit out the gag. She does so.]
CARTER
(Angry)
You better kill me now, because I am going to talk.
ABU
Here. You may eat and drink.
CARTER
What the hell do you think you're doing?
ABU
There is something I want...more then life itself. Until yesterday,
I thought it was impossible. And then I saw you, dressed like that.
And I knew...
(pleased)
your beauty would buy it for me.
CARTER
What do you mean "buy"?
ABU
I will trade you.
CARTER
(shocked)
You...you can't do that.
ABU
(matter-of-fact)
I can.
CARTER
I'm a human being, not property.
ABU
Where we are going, the men are not as tolerant as my father.
(shakes a finger at Carter)
Be warned.
[Carter stares at him, pressing her lips together.]
INT--YURT--DAY
[Daniel is sitting in Carter's tent; he checks the clip on Carter's
handgun, still holstered with her vest. He looks worried. O'Neill walks
in.]
O'NEILL
Any sign?
DANIEL
No. No one's seen her since last night.
O'NEILL
All right, find Teal'c, I want everybody geared up and ready to move
out in fifteen minutes.
DANIEL
Well...Okay, let me talk to Moughal first, this might be another
misunderstanding--cultural differences.
O'NEILL
The hell with culture; a member of my team has been neutralized.
That's a hostile act.
DANIEL
How is it that you always come up with the worst-case scenario?
O'NEILL
I practice.
[Teal'c walks in, Moughal following him.]
TEAL'C
I found fresh hoof prints leading out of the camp.
O'NEILL
That's great.
TEAL'C
The horse should be identifiable. One of the hooves was splayed.
MOUGHAL
The horse belongs to my son. He is also missing.
[Teal'c, O'Neill and Daniel all look at Moughal.]
O'NEILL
Okay, dad, what's going on here?
MOUGHAL
(uneasily)
I am as ignorant as you.
O'NEILL
I don't think so. Now, he took Captain Carter. I want to know why.
MOUGHAL
(sighs)
Among the Shavadai, women are valued highly for trade. Foreign
women, most of all.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Can you help me track them?
TEAL'C
Now that I know what to look for, I believe so.
DANIEL
(to Moughal)
If Abu gives her up peacefully, no one will get hurt.
(to O'Neill)
Right?
O'NEILL
We'll do our best.
MOUGHAL
I will give you horses, and guide you myself. My son has betrayed me
as well as you.
[Moughal walks out of the tent. SG-1 exchanges a grim look, and follow
him.]
EXT--WOODS--DAY
[Carter is tied on a horse, Abu leading her on his horse. They approach
another village. The village is not as colorful as Abu's home. The
villagers dress differently, the animals roaming around the tent are
cows. Carter's bright blue dress practically glows in amidst the grey
and brown colors as Abu leads her to the center of the village. Men
stare. The women in this village are covered with black veils over
their dresses.]
[Abu dismounts as a tall man exits one of the tents. The man pulls out
a knife, but Abu still approaches him, his head high.]
ABU
Turghan may wish to bid me welcome. I have come to trade.
[Abu turns to look at Carter. Turghan looks too.]
TURGHAN
(sneers)
Then come, Shavadai.
[Turghan turns and enters his tent.]
INT--TURGHAN'S TENT--DAY
[Carter's hands are bound in front of her, the veil is over her face.
Turghan is being dressed, assisted by two women.]
TURGHAN
See the son of my enemy, how he pales in my presence. You risk your
head coming here. For what? You think this interests me?
ABU
Yes.
[Reaching over, Abu pulls the veil from Carter's face, then pulls a gag
away from her mouth.]
CARTER
I don't belong to this man. I was abducted against my will.
TURGHAN
(staring at Carter, but talking to Abu)
Where is she from?
ABU
The sea of Ogada.
CARTER
My friends will come after me. They have weapons more powerful then
you can imagine, and they won't hesitate...
TURGHAN
Silence!
[Carter stops talking, staring at him.]
TURGHAN
Or I will have you beaten.
ABU
You may do whatever you wish with her...when she is yours.
TURGHAN
(smiles faintly)
Then I would see her.
[Abu turns and pulls off Carter's headdress.]
ABU
(demands softly)
Turn around.
CARTER
(not moving her lips)
No.
[Turghan jumps to his feet, grabs a knife and holds it against Carter's
throat.]
TURGHAN
(menacingly)
Slowly.
[He moves one finger in a circular motion. Carter glares at him, but
slowly turns in a circle. Turghan keeps the knife at her throat. When
she comes back around, she won't look at him.]
TURGHAN
Your skin is very fair. Look at me!
[Carter glares at him.]
TURGHAN
Her eyes...are the color of blue river stones.
[He pulls the knife away.]
TURGHAN
Sit.
[Turghan returns to his chair. Abu puts a hand on Carter's shoulder,
she jerks out of his grasp, staring into space. Abu sits, Carter stays
standing.]
ABU
Are you satisfied?
TURGHAN
Name your price.
[Carter looks down, her face stony. Light falls across the tent as the
flap moves. A girl crosses to kneel by Turghan. Abu jumps up. The girl
drops her veil. They stare at each other. Carter frowns, studying
them.]
TURGHAN
Why do you hesitate? So, name it. Gold, horses, weapons. I have the
finest metal craftsmen in the mountains.
ABU
No.
TURGHAN
Well, what then?
ABU
Nya.
[Everyone looks at the girl on the floor who smiles hopefully at
Turghan.]
TURGHAN
You would trade a woman for another woman?
ABU
Nya is not just another woman.
TURGHAN
No. She is my daughter.
[Turghan ignores Nya who is smiling at Abu.]
TURGHAN
She will marry a chieftain. The desert warlord Chimakka.
[Carter frowns as Nya jumps up, putting a hand on her father's arm.]
NYA
Father, please.
TURGHAN
It is done! Chimakka will come on the next moon.
NYA
That's three days.
CARTER
How can you do that to your own daughter?
TURGHAN
Your beauty will not soften my anger much longer. The offer for the
woman is three hundred weights of gold.
[He snaps a pouch at Abu.]
TURGHAN
Take it or die; either way the woman is mine.
[As Nya stares at Abu hopefully, he takes the pouch of gold.]
ABU
Done.
[Abu looks away from Nya. He will not meet her eyes. He leaves the
tent. Carter and Nya watch him go. Nya starts to cry. Another woman
comes to her and hugs her. As Carter looks at Turghan, he backhands
her.]
TURGHAN
Here, a woman does not speak, unless she is spoken to.
[Carter stares at him, an unspoken challenge in her eyes.]
EXT--WOODS--DAY
[Teal'c kneels on the ground, examining the path.]
TEAL'C
They stopped here.
MOUGHAL
To rest the horses, and so must we. For two marks.
[During the stop, Moughal is eating, Daniel sitting beside him.]
MOUGHAL
If we do not find them, I will pay whatever you ask for the loss of
Carter.
DANIEL
We can't do that, we don't...own our women.
MOUGHAL
Truly?
DANIEL
Yes. Um...
[He looks over at O'Neill and Teal'c, who are also eating.]
DANIEL
And we heard...stories about Shavadai women...That once they were
free. Some were even warriors, fought with their husband in battles.
(to O'Neill)
Um...Mongol women might have been the legendary Amazons...
MOUGHAL
Shhh, we do not speak of it. The laws for women were made to protect
and hide them from the demons, who brought us to this place.
TEAL'C
Demons?
MOUGHAL
It is only in legend, and long time ago; in the dawn of our time.
TEAL'C
If the demons are gone, why have not the laws been changed?
MOUGHAL
Some say they will return. I think it is an excuse for my men to
have their way. Among the Shavadai, even the lowliest man is chief
among his women.
DANIEL
Is that why you only have one wife? To...set a kind of example?
MOUGHAL
(looks sad)
My people see it as a weakness.
DANIEL
Because you love her?
[Moughal turns quickly to look at Daniel, then slowly smiles. Daniel
smiles back.]
EXT--TURGHAN'S CAMP--DAY
[Abu is hiding in the woods outside the camp. He sneaks up to the
women's tent when no one is watching and looks inside. Abu whistles
like a bird; Nya looks up and runs to the entrance.]
NYA
My father will kill you.
[Abu reaches out to caress her face.]
ABU
Come away with me. Tonight.
NYA
You know I cannot. Now go, before they find you here.
ABU
I have listened to the wind, you will come. I will wait for you by
the tem tree.
[Abu smiles, and caresses her face one more time, then jumps up and
runs back to the woods. Nya stares after him.]
EXT--TURGHAN'S CAMP--DAY
[Carter faces away from Turghan, who is reclining on the ground, eating
fruit, his wives behind him.]
TURGHAN
Now you are Tugai, women of the forest. What can you do? Can you
cook? Spin weave, make dyes?
CARTER
I'm a lousy cook, and I couldn't spin, weave, or dye if my life
depended on it. You made yourself a bad deal.
TURGHAN
Well, where you come from, you must have done something.
CARTER
In my world, I am a warrior and a scholar, I do the work of men.
[Turghan drops the fruit and jumps to his feet.]
TURGHAN
A warrior. Let me tell you what I do.
(leaning close to Carter)
I raid and burn the tents of my enemies. I slaughter the men and
trade the women and children. For this, I am feared. And because of
that fear, I have the allegiance of twenty-two tribes.
CARTER
But you have to sell your daughter off to make it twenty-three?
TURGHAN
(angry)
How would you like to be hung upside down, with dust-filled rags
stuffed in your mouth and nostrils? A slow death from suffocation.
[They stare at each other for a moment. Carter turns her head and looks
away.]
CARTER
I'm sorry, I'm sure you know what's best for her.
TURGHAN
The spirits have brought you here to teach you how to be a woman.
[Carter doesn't look impressed. Turghan walks away. Carter blinks.]
EXT--TURGHAN'S WOMEN'S CAMP--LATER
[Carter is sitting by a fire, cutting up a large plate of food. Nya
walks in with an arm full of cotton, she drops it in front of one of
the women and, placing her hands over her face, starts to cry. All the
women rush to comfort her, leading her into a tent.]
[With everyone gone Carter cleans the knife and hides it in her dress.
She hooks the veil over her face and sneaks off to the horses. Carter
jumps on one and gallops away, into the woods. One of the camp guards
spots her and whistles. The horse rears up, Carter slides off, landing
on the ground. Two guards rush out of the trees and grab her, pulling
her to her feet.]
GUARD
You belong to Turghan!
CARTER
Get your hands off me, let me go!
[The guards pull her back toward the camp.]
INT--TURGHAN'S TENT--DAY
[Carter is once again bound, kneeling at Turghan's feet. The guard
hands the knife she had hidden to Turghan.]
TURGHAN
What kind of woman are you? Do you respect nothing? Care for no one
but yourself?
[He looks at the women standing around him.]
TURGHAN
These were responsible for you, now because of you, they will be
punished.
[One of the women hands Turghan a whip. He shakes is out as she turns
around and kneels. Turghan rips the woman's dress down. He's pulls back
his arm, ready to hit her with the whip, when Carter jumps up and
shouts.]
CARTER
No! It was my fault. If you need to beat a woman to feel like a man,
try me.
[Turghan stops and stares at her.]
TURGHAN
I value spirit in my horses, not in my women.
[Turghan yanks off Carter's headdress and grabs her hair. Pulling her
head back, he kisses her violently.]
TURGHAN
You belong to me. You will learn your place and be obedient. Or you
will suffer far worse then a beating.
EXT--TURGHAN'S WOMEN'S CAMP--DAY
[Carter is pulling grapes off the stem, and dropping them into a
basket. The blue dress is nowhere in sight; she is clad in the everyday
clothing of Turghan's camp.]
NYA
I heard what you did for my mother.
[Carter acknowledges her words with a nod.]
NYA
I am grateful.
CARTER
It's okay.
NYA
We are all afraid. If you do not obey, my father will kill you.
CARTER
I know.
NYA
My father is a good man; he never mistreats a woman unless she has
done something wrong.
CARTER
Unless...
[Carter sputters wordlessly.]
CARTER
There is no excuse to beat a woman, ever.
NYA
He is a powerful warlord! Our women and our children are always
protected, always have food.
CARTER
How can you defend him? He's packing you off to marry a total
stranger.
NYA
I have no choice. I am not free to choose.
[She looks down sadly.]
CARTER
And you never will be until one of you says no.
[Nya searches Carter's face. They stay quiet as one of the other women
approaches the fire. After she leaves, Nya turns to Carter.]
NYA
I want to say it. Will you help me?
[Carter smiles and holds out her hand. Nya takes it. They hold onto
each other tightly.]
EXT--WOODS OUTSIDE TURGHAN'S VILLAGE--DAY
[Teal'c, O'Neill, Daniel and Moughal lurk in the woods, watching the
village.]
TEAL'C
(pointing at the village)
The tracks lead directly there.
O'NEILL
Who owns the place?
MOUGHAL
An enemy. A man who kills for pleasure. This is very bad.
O'NEILL
Well then, we'lll go in and get her tonight.
MOUGHAL
If we attack, there will be war. And Turghan is allied with
twenty-two clans. When he fights, he takes no prisoners.
DANIEL
You mean they'd kill all of you?
MOUGHAL
Yes. If you will wait until morning, I will go and request a trade.
He cannot refuse.
TEAL'C
But what will happen to Dr. Carter tonight if we wait?
[Moughal looks away.]
MOUGHAL
Turghan will partake in his newest purchase.
O'NEILL
Oh, there's not a chance in hell.
DANIEL
In our land, if a man wants a woman, she can say no.
MOUGHAL
No one refuses Turghan, and lives.
O'NEILL
Then we go now.
[They rise to their feet and head down into the village.]
MAN
Stop!
[Carter and Nya look at each other. Carter goes to the cloth wall and
peeks between the hangings. She sees Moughal and her teammates.]
CARTER
(grinning)
Yes!
MAN
(outside)
You don't have the right!
[With Nya watching, Carter takes a small branch out of the fire and
carries it to one side of the enclosure. Setting it on the straw, she
watches as it sets first the straw, then the hangings separating their
enclosure from the main village on fire. Everyone begins to yell as the
cloth is engulfed. There are indistinguishable shouts as men from all
over the camp run over to yank the burning fabric down and put the fire
out.]
CARTER
(pushing Nya)
Go. Go Nya, go.
[Nya rushes out and runs for the woods.]
INT--TURGHAN'S TENT--DAY
[Turghan is pacing before his newest guests.]
TURGHAN
I paid three hundred weights of gold.
DANIEL
(to Moughal)
Is that a lot?
MOUGHAL
(whispers)
Enough to buy ten women.
O'NEILL
(to Moughal)
How much are you willing to spend to get her back?
MOUGHAL
We will offer three hundred and fifty weights of gold.
TURGHAN
Enh. She is difficult. But beautiful. A rare prize.
DANIEL
(whispers)
Four hundred.
MOUGHAL
Four hundred.
TURGHAN
I may even make her a wife.
O'NEILL
Oh for crying out loud, five hundred!
[Moughal looks, aghast, at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
We'll pay you back.
TURGHAN
Why this one? I have others younger, fit to bear many sons; enough
to start your own tribe.
DANIEL
She is a woman of power for our people. Not only a warrior but a...a
shaman. She knows the spirits of our land. They will tell her when
it's time to plant grain, when water will be scarce...things like
that.
TURGHAN
You take me for a fool?
MOUGHAL
He speaks truly. In the land of Ogada, the women are...as ours were
long ago.
DANIEL
That and more! Carter is our chieftain. Our people need her.
TURGHAN
Get out. You have nothing I want.
O'NEILL
Oh yeah?
[O'Neill pulls out and fires his pistol, shooting a lamp. Turghan and
his wife jump with surprise. O'Neill holds up the gun. Turghan pulls
out his knife and approaches O'Neill. They stare at each other. O'Neill
smiles and looks down at the gun; Turghan looks at it too. O'Neill
nods]
TURGHAN
Done.
EXT--TURGHAN'S VILLAGE--DAY
[Turghan is standing in a circle made up of his people. He shoots his
gun in the air. The people yelp and cower, covering their ears. Turghan
cheers and his men join him in a ragged chorus.]
O'NEILL
All right, there are only five more rounds in that clip, time to go.
[SG-1 and Moughal ride off on their horses, Carter last in line, her
hands bound to the horse's saddle. The villagers are still cheering as
they leave.]
EXT--WOODS--NIGHT
[Carter is back in her SGC uniform, smiling and happy.]
CARTER
What a relief. I have never been so happy to see you guys.
O'NEILL
Oh, sure you have! Remember that time on P3X-595?
[Carter starts to lose her smile.]
O'NEILL
You drank that stuff that made you take off...
CARTER
Ahem. We won't get into that now.
[Daniel looks at O'Neill, who smirks and looks away.]
CARTER
Moughal, I want to thank you for your help.
MOUGHAL
(looking sober)
We'll leave at first light.
CARTER
I don't blame you for what Abu did. I don't blame him either, now.
MOUGHAL
He is suffering the madness, as I did when I was young.
[Carter frowns in confusion.]
DANIEL
It's what they call love.
CARTER
Ah, got it.
[Moughal stares into the fire.]
EXT--SG-1 CAMP--EARLY MORNING
[Teal'c is on guard while everyone else sleeps. Hoofbeats sound,
approaching the camp. Everyone but Daniel is up in an instant, weapons
ready. Abu rides in.]
ABU
Please, you must help me.
CARTER
What happened? Where's Nya?
[Daniel awakens too, instantly alert.]
ABU
She came to me, just like the wind said she would. But before we
could make our way, her father caught us. Now, if you do not help
me, she will be stoned to death.
[Everyone looks at him, horrified.]
ABU
Curse me for the madness. Better to have left her to marry Chimakka.
MOUGHAL
I would not see anything I cared for go to Chimakka.
O'NEILL
Can I get a little clarification here? Her own father ordered her
stoned to death...is that right?
ABU
Because she broke the law of the land.
MOUGHAL
Turghan is compelled to uphold the law, even more if it applies to
his own. He must rule by example.
CARTER
We have to go back, now!
O'NEILL
Negative.
CARTER
She can't be more than sixteen or seventeen!
O'NEILL
Captain, if we go in there and try and get that little girl out, we
could be starting a war on this planet.
CARTER
Since when are you a politician, Colonel?
O'NEILL
Easy, Captain.
CARTER
"De Opresso Liber." To free from oppression, Special Forces motto.
O'NEILL
I know what it is. That's our world, this is theirs.
DANIEL
Do we have the right to interfere with their customs
or...reinterpret their laws?
CARTER
Yes! Maybe you guy aren't getting this, but they're about to kill
this teenage girl. Simply for being in love with this boy!
ABU
Please, use your weapons, and free her.
MOUGHAL
The Colonel is right. It would mean war, Abu. My son, you
must...choose, between one woman, and your people.
ABU
I cannot.
[Moughal hugs Abu, his face troubled.]
CARTER
Neither can I. Nya broke the law because of me. I can't leave her
here to die.
TEAL'C
But if it is one life, or many...
DANIEL
Wait. Now there has to be another way. Moughal, what about the old
laws? Isn't there something that we can...
ABU
Yes. Yes, if we fight with law, Turghan cannot make war. Father,
please, think, remember...there must be a law.
[Moughal concentrates, staring into space.]
MOUGHAL
There is one.
EXT--TURGHAN'S VILLAGE--DAY
[Turghan's men stand in the center of the village with stones in their
hands. A sobbing Nya is forced to sit against a pole. Turghan stares at
the ground, his face expressionless. Nya looks from one man to another.
No one has any expression, they simply stare at her.]
NYA
Father, forgive me.
[Turghan approaches Nya, and kneels. He puts one hand on her shoulder,
then cups the back of her head and whispers in her ear.]
TURGHAN
I forgive you.
[Nya closes her eyes. Turghan rises. Nya watches him. He turns to Nya's
mother, sobbing in another woman's arms. His face twists.]
TURGHAN
Stone her!
[The women cry out. The men raise their hands to throw the stones. Nya
looks frightened, and turns her head away.]
MOUGHAL
Do not!
[As Moughal walks into the village, the men drop their stones and pull
out swords.]
TURGHAN
You have no say here, Shavadai.
ABU
Stoning may be challenged.
[Nya looks up as Abu walks from behind his father.]
ABU
By another chieftain.
TURGHAN
There is no such law.
MOUGHAL
There is. In the song of Arkhan-tyr. The sprits will strengthen the
hand of the just.
TURGHAN
I will not fight a cripple.
MOUGHAL
You must.
TURGHAN
You insult my honor by implying that I would engage in such a
slaughter. You will lose, and my daughter will still die. So unless
there is another chieftain who will challenge my decision...
[Carter pulls off her helmet and steps around Abu.]
CARTER
I challenge it.
[The village women exchange a hopeful glance. O'Neill looks
unsurprised.]
TURGHAN
You? You plague me.
CARTER
Then fight. Here's your chance to shut me up once and for all.
[Turghan looks at Moughal, who smiles encouragingly.]
TURGHAN
I will abide by the wisdom of the spirits. Let them decide justly.
[Carter nods.]
EXT--TURGHAN'S VILLAGE--DAY
[Carter takes off her guns and hands them to O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
So when your back's up against the wall, and there's no tomorrow,
just take one day at a time, and remember the bigger they are...et
cetera.
CARTER
You don't think I can win.
O'NEILL
Sure I do. I assume you've had at least some basic hand-to-hand
training.
CARTER
Yeah, level three, advanced.
O'NEILL
(pats her on the back)
You'll do fine.
[Carter rolls her eyes and approaches Turghan, who's waiting. She
raises her hands in a boxing stance.]
O'NEILL
(to Moughal)
So, just out of curiosity, how do the sprits determine who wins?
MOUGHAL
It is a fight to the death.
O'NEILL
Death?
[Turghan pulls out a large curved blade. It catches the light,
glinting. Carter looks astonished and glances back at her team.]
O'NEILL
Hey, no one said anything about...
[Turgan's men suddenly whip out a variety of knives, holding them
against O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c's throats.]
O'NEILL
...knives.
[Carter pulls an eight-inch blade from a sheath on her thigh and holds
it up.]
[Carter and Turghan fight. Both are quick and agile. O'Neill, still at
knifepoint fingers his rifle surreptitiously. Carter gets first blood,
slicing Turghan across his ribs. His people are astonished. Turghan
attacks with increased fury. They battle back and forth. Turghan hits
Carter, who falls to the ground. He chops his knife down at her, but
she avoids the blow, kicks him and regains her feet. Using her level
three, advanced skills, she disarms Turghan and gets him down on the
ground, her knife to his throat. Nya, her hands still tied behind her
back, runs up.]
NYA
Carter, do not kill him.
CARTER
I don't want to.
NYA
You have won. I am free to go with Abu.
CARTER
(to Turghan)
I want to hear it from you.
TURGHAN
(grudgingly)
She's free to go.
CARTER
And the Shavadai?
TURGHAN
By law, there can be no war between us.
CARTER
And me?
[Turghan doesn't say anything. Carter presses the knife harder.]
CARTER
And me?
TURGHAN
You have won. You are also free to go.
[Carter pulls the knife away and stands. She turns to face her CO.
O'Neill pushes the knife away from his throat and smiles.]
EXT--MOUGHAL'S VILLAGE--DAY
[Carter, O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel are standing with Moughal, Abu, Nya
and Abu's mother.]
MOUGHAL
You will not stay for the wedding?
O'NEILL
Ahh, a six day wedding. You know, we really should get back.
ABU
It is a joyous time!
DANIEL
But we all wish you and Nya many years of happiness, and many sons
too.
[Carter pokes Daniel in the ribs with her elbow.]
DANIEL
And daughters!
[Carter smiles. Abu and Nya smile at each other. Moughal smiles and
nods.]
MOUGHAL
All Shavadai, be free!
[There is cheering and clapping, and the cloth barrier separating the
women from the rest of the village comes down. For the first time, the
women stand in public without veils. They look very happy.]
MOUGHAL
It is how you will be remembered, Carter.
[As her teammates look at her, Carter grins. Their arms wrapped around
each other, Abu and Nya watch the team turn and leave.]
EXT--PLANET--DAY
[The team approaches the Stargate.]
CARTER
So you think this new anesthesia will be a new miracle drug on
Earth?
DANIEL
Well if it is, I bet somebody else will get the credit. We can never
say where it came from.
O'NEILL
Damn. Guess I'm going to have to cancel that Oprah interview.
TEAL'C
What is an Oprah?
