TEASER
EXT--ENTRANCE TO CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAYTIME
INT--INFIRMARY
[Daniel is sitting on bed getting the burn on his arm tended by a
nurse.]
DANIEL
"Beware The Destroyers". That's what the message said. These are the
coordinates the Goa'uld will launch their attack from. It was a
warning.
[Daniel shows the piece of paper still gripped in his hand.]
TEAL'C
Or so your vision foretells.
DANIEL
No! It wasn't a vision or a dream or a hallucination. It was
(Daniel winces as the nurse rips bandage)
real. Now, I know this is hard for you guys to believe. But I swear
to you, the entire time you thought I had disappeared on P3R-233, I
was experiencing an alternate reality.
O'NEILL
And you were there,
(nods to Teal'c)
and you were there,
(nods to Carter)
and there's no place like home.
DANIEL
As a matter of fact you were there.
CARTER
Daniel. It's not that we don't believe you...
DANIEL
So you do?
O'NEILL
No. It's just that...we don't believe you.
DANIEL
Jack, this is very important.
CARTER
All right. Daniel, when you were in this alternate reality, were
there differences?
DANIEL
Yes. Uh, Teal'c was leading the attack on Earth. I wasn't even part
of the program. You and Jack were engaged to be married...
O'NEILL
Excuse me?
CARTER
What?
(she exchanges surprised looks with O'Neill)
Okay, uh, even if you did actually experience the alternate reality,
doesn't the very fact that there were differences mean that we won't
face the same fate?
DANIEL
Yes. But the defining event, the death of Ra, took place in both
worlds.
TEAL'C
An attack of retribution.
DANIEL
Yes! And the same thing is going to happen here unless we stop it.
O'NEILL
All right. Wait a minute. Let...Let me get something straight here.
Engaged?
CARTER
It is theoretically possible.
O'NEILL
It's against regulations!
CATER
I'm talking physics, sir. Though the whole concept of alternate
realities, entire alternate universes, was predicted by Einstein a
long time ago...
[Hammond enters the infirmary with Samuels behind him.]
HAMMOND
I thought you might all be here. How's our boy?
CARTER
He's gonna to be just fine, General.
(She greets the officer with Hammond)
Major Samuels.
SAMUELS
That's, er, Lieutenant Colonel Samuels now, Captain.
CARTER
I beg your pardon, sir. Congratulations.
SAMUELS
Thank you.
O'NEILL
You'll always be "Sparky" to me.
CARTER
I thought you'd been transferred to the Pentagon, sir.
SAMUELS
I was. Stargate Mission Analysis. I'm here today, of course, for the
hearing.
O'NEILL
Hearing?
SAMUELS
Senator Kinsey? The Stargate Program? Uh, I thought you were going
to testify.
HAMMOND
They will. SG-1 just retuned from a mission last night. I haven't
had a chance to inform them.
SAMUELS
Well, perhaps I shouldn't say too much more.
O'NEILL
Oh, cut the crap, Samuels. What's going on?
SAMUELS
Senator Kinsey has taken a great deal of interest in the program.
And thus far he hasn't liked what he's seen.
O'NEILL
(dryly)
I'm sorry to hear that.
SAMUELS
As you should be, Colonel. It could mean the end of the Stargate.
The hearing is at 1400 hours. I look forward to seeing you all
there.
[Samuels exits.]
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ENTRANCE TO CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAYTIME
INT--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is on the red phone. O'Neill stands nearby.]
HAMMOND
Yes, sir, I understand. We'll fight the good fight.
[Hammond hangs up phone.]
O'NEILL
General, politics isn't my strong suit, but doesn't President
outrank senator?
HAMMOND
Senator Kinsey is Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He's
demanded to know what is behind the line item the Pentagon refers to
as Area 52.
O'NEILL
That would be the Stargate.
HAMMOND
An unofficial project...that just happens to cost 7.4 billion
dollars a year to operate. The President and the Joint Chiefs
thought if they granted the Senator the appropriate clearances, let
him in on the existence of the SGC, he'd recognise its importance to
national security and authorise the expenditure.
O'NEILL
I take it he didn't.
HAMMOND
The idea backfired. After reading your mission reports and being
fully briefed by Colonel Samuels, the Senator decided the SGC would
receive no further funding from the Treasury.
O'NEILL
That effectively shuts us down, sir.
HAMMOND
Very effectively. It costs nearly a billion dollars just to turn the
lights on around here.
O'NEILL
How 'bout a bake sale? Yard sale? Garage?
HAMMOND
This is what I look like when I'm not laughing, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Car wash?
[Hammond suppresses a laugh.]
O'NEILL
I'm sorry, sir. It's just I--I don't get it. How does one man get
that much power?
HAMMOND
The Constitution of these United States. The issue of our worth
could be debated openly in the Senate, but not without making the
Stargate known to the general public. The President doesn't believe
the time for that has come. I agree with him.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
O'NEILL
Well, he's late.
TEAL'C
You seem more apprehensive of this hearing than you are of battle.
O'NEILL
I prefer battle, actually.
DANIEL
I'm sure once we tell him that Earth's future is at stake...
O'NEILL
Daniel. Let's just keep the alternative reality story as our little
ace in the hole, shall we?
DANIEL
Why?
[Lieutenant Colonel Samuels, military aides and Senator Kinsey walk
down the spiral staircase into the briefing room.]
O'NEILL
Just because.
[He taps Daniel on the shoulder.]
KINSEY
Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise. A certain congressman, who will
go nameless, just does not know how to take "no" for an answer. Ah,
this is the infamous SG-1.
O'NEILL
Infamous? Yes, sir. Colonel Jack O'Neill.
[He steps forward and shakes hands with Kinsey.]
KINSEY
Colonel. I've heard a lot about you.
O'NEILL
Don't believe a word of it, Senator. I'm actually a nice guy.
[Kinsey walks past. O'Neill rolls his eyes unobserved.]
KINSEY
And this must be the drain through which the money flows.
HAMMOND
I know you have a very busy schedule, Senator.
KINSEY
Yes. Of course, General Hammond. Please be seated. Let me see.
Colonel O'Neill. Captain Carter. Doctor Jackson. Teal'c. With an
apostrophe, I understand. Let me first say that though illness
robbed me of the chance ever to serve in this country's military, I
have the greatest respect for those who do. Especially those who
have made service of country their life's work. As I have in my own
way. There is no more honourable vocation.
HAMMOND
Thank you, Senator. I couldn't agree more.
KINSEY
Having said that, I want to make one thing abundantly clear. I am by
nature suspicious of all things secretive. Be they in the government
or inside the military service. I believe that which grows in
shadow, but withers in the light of day...does not belong on the
vine. I've read several reports of your excursions. Colonel Samuels
has been kind enough to brief me on the Stargate, and I have tried
to maintain an open mind. I must admit that I find the very idea of
this facility, of this command, offensive. It is far too dangerous
to be this secretive. I have found several examples where you have
averted tragedy on a global scale by the skin of your teeth, and
virtually none where you have brought back anything of worth.
However since I have, on occasion, been wrong before. The President
of the United States has asked me to hear you out. So here I am.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Well. So long as you've got an open mind.
HAMMOND
Colonel.
O'NEILL
For crying out loud, Samuels, what did you tell this man?
SAMUELS
The truth.
KINSEY
Colonel Samuels was entirely nonpartisan.
O'NEILL
Okay, now that's impossible. He's been against this program from day
one.
SAMUELS
If anything, I voiced my awe and amazement at what the Stargate is:
a technological marvel.
CARTER
It is so much more than that, Senator. The Stargate represents a
giant step in our understanding of the universe. We have learned
more about astrophysics in these few months than in the last fifty
years.
DANIEL
It also gives us insights into human cultures that are thousands of
years old.
KINSEY
Doctor Jackson, I'm sure as a scholar of ancient mythology you're
familiar with the story of Pandora.
DANIEL
From Greek mythology, of course. The first woman ever created by
Zeus, who according to legend, gave her a box and warned her never
to open it.
KINSEY
But she did. Out of curiosity. Despite the warning of her god, who
was also her father, she did. And from it sprung all the plagues,
pestilence and evil that exists now in this world.
DANIEL
And keeping in mind that we are talking about a myth, she closed it
in time to keep hope inside.
KINSEY
Then should we not close your 'gate for the same reason, to keep
hope inside?
O'NEILL
Senator if...if I may jump in here. I'm not as slick as you guys
talking in metaphors here. I'm a military man. I prefer facts. And
the fact is the 'gate, i.e., the box, is already open. Now what's
done is done. We made ourselves an enemy by killing Ra. But the
threat the Goa'ulds now represent...
KINSEY
Threat?
O'NEILL
Yes, sir. As in "threatening".
KINSEY
The word "threat", Colonel O'Neill, has been used far too often by
this country's military as a justification for expenditures that we
can no longer afford. Do you know how much this program costs?
O'NEILL
Seven-ish.
KINSEY
7 billion, 407 million dollars.
O'NEILL
Give or take.
KINSEY
Per year.
O'NEILL
With all due respect, Senator, the Accounting Department is up on
Level 3, I believe. But if you want to talk about maintaining the
first line of defence against, what I believe is the greatest enemy
humanity has ever faced...
KINSEY
Hyperbole.
O'NEILL
See for yourself! General, I suggest we dial up 'ol P4A-771, I
believe it was. See how long the good Senator lasts in that world.
KINSEY
I have spent a career listening to doomsayers in uniform. Let us
build our billion dollar machine and we will save America from the
barbarians at the gate. Let me remind you that the Cold War is over.
O'NEILL
And let me tell you something. This time there really are
barbarians. They're called Goa'ulds, and they really are at the
gate. That one!
KINSEY
Then I suggest we close it.
DANIEL
Senator, we have reason to believe that the Goa'uld are about to
launch an attack, in force, in ships.
KINSEY
Then I think they'll regret taking on the United States military.
O'NEILL
Oh for God's sake!
DANIEL
Oh, you're right. We'll--We'll-we'll just upload a computer virus
into the mothership.
CARTER
If they come in ships, Senator, we won't be any match for them. At
their level of technology they can wipe us out from orbit.
KINSEY
I'm not convinced of that.
TEAL'C
They speak the truth.
KINSEY
I'm not entirely convinced of that either.
O'NEILL
(stands up)
General, what the hell are we doing here? This man has made up his
mind already.
KINSEY
(also stands up)
Sit down, Colonel. When I've made up my mind, you will know it. I
will ask you once more. Sit down. Please.
HAMMOND
Colonel.
[O'Neill sits, and Kinsey also sits.]
KINSEY
I gave the President my word that I would give you a fair hearing,
and I intend to do that. He held you and your team up as a shining
example of the fine work the SGC is doing. Now, do you stand by
SG-1's record?
O'NEILL
Yes, I do.
KINSEY
Then let's just go through it, shall we?
EXT--A TRUCK ENTERS CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Confidential folders are handed out among Kinsey's team.]
KINSEY
Thank you.
(opens and reads from the first file)
On February 10 of this year, you along with a team lead by Major
Charles Kawalsky went through the Stargate on a reconnaissance
mission--
O'NEILL
Excuse me, Senator. Samuels, could I get a copy of that?
KINSEY
You wrote this report, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Just want a little reference.
KINSEY
Samuels.
(Samuels looks at aide next to him, who passes her report to
O'Neill.)
To repeat. On the tenth of February of this year, you along with a
team lead by Major Charles Kawalsky, went through the Stargate on a
reconnaissance mission to rescue both Doctor Jackson's wife and her
brother, and to determine the Goauld [pronounced GoAld] threat.
O'NEILL
Excuse me, Senator. I'm sorry. There should be an apostrophe after
the "A", before the "U". It's pronounced...
[He looks to Carter.]
CARTER
(pronouncing correctly)
Goa'uld.
KINSEY
I assume, since shortly after arriving you were captured and
imprisoned, that you would characterise this world as an enemy
stronghold.
O'NEILL
I would.
[Kinsey nods to Samuels.]
SAMUELS
I read from the personal report of Colonel Jack O'Neill dated the
23rd February. "Skaara was chosen. I tried to stop them from taking
him away, but was struck by an alien staff weapon. In that moment,
Apophis gave the order."
FLASHBACK--1.02 "CHILDREN OF THE GODS PART TWO"'
INT--DUNGEON OF APOPHIS' CASTLE ON CHULAK
APOPHIS
Kill the rest!
[Crowd screams and surges away from the serpent guards who walk down
the stairs towards them. O'Neill, Daniel and Carter get off the ground.
Amaunet and Apophis turn away and enter the sedan chair. Guards
continue to advance down stairs, towards the panicking crowd. The sedan
chair leaves, followed by some guards. The iron gate closes behind
them, locking the prisoners in with the serpent guards. Teal'c, in
serpent guard uniform, advances through the crowd. Serpent guards prime
their weapons.]
O'NEILL
I can save these people!
[Teal'c whirls to face him, primes his staff weapon.]
O'NEILL
Help me! Help me.
TEAL'C
Many have said that.
(whirls and shoots the first serpent guard)
But you are the first I believe could do it.
[Teal'c throws his staff weapon to O'Neill. Carter pulls Daniel out of
the line of fire. Teal'c grabs the fallen guard's staff weapon. A
firefight ensues, as the crowd cower against the back wall. Some
prisoners are shot. O'Neill and Teal'c kill all the serpent guards and
then race up the stairs to scare the other people outside the gate
away. O'Neill turns at the top of the stairs.]
O'NEILL
Get out of the way!
[People move away from the back wall. O'Neill blows a hole in the wall,
and then runs over to the it, joined by Carter. Daniel gets to feet.
O'Neill checks outside the prison wall, to ensure it is safe.]
O'NEILL
Come on! Let's move!
CARTER
All right. Come on.
[Carter runs out the hole in the wall. People start running out after
her.]

So, even with your team unarmed, at the enemy's mercy, in the palm

[The prisoners led by O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Teal'c run through
the forest. A death glider sweeps down towards them. The glider primes
its guns.]
O'NEILL
Take cover!
[Daniel helps people out of the way. People are running everywhere for
cover. Explosions hit the ground as the first shots from death glider
hit nearby. Fighter comes in to attack. More explosions. O'Neill and
Teal'c fire staff weapons at the death glider. They hit the glider to
no effect. The fighter continues to strafe the ground around them, one
sweep past after another. O'Neill and Teal'c continue to fire at it.
People are hit by the shots.]
CARTER
Colonel! We're sitting ducks here.
[O'Neill and Teal'c continue to fire at the death glider. A member of
SG-2 fires a ground to air missile at the glider and hits it directly.
It hits the ground and explodes.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
[Kinsey gets up and starts to walk around the table.]
KINSEY
It seems to me that Major Kawalsky made light work of what you refer
to in your report as a "death glider".
O'NEILL
They were taken by surprise. I wouldn't expect it to be as easy next
time.
KINSEY
Why not?
DANIEL
Well for one thing, they weren't use to fighting humans with our
level of technology. Now they know what we have.
CARTER
I don't think you understand how much more powerful their weapons
are.
KINSEY
Yet you managed to get away with minimal casualties. Hardly the
greatest threat humanity has ever faced.
[Kinsey walks by the briefing room window. The Gate activates.]
KINSEY
(alarmed)
What's happening?
HAMMOND
It's just SG-2 returning on schedule, Senator. There's nothing to
worry about.
[The Gate shuts down.]
KINSEY
Oh, I disagree General. I think it is something to worry about.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX--NIGHTTIME

sensing something is wrong.]
APOPHIS
Shak'l!
[Shak'l walks in front and examines a foot print in the dirt. They walk
into ravine. Teal'c runs out from cover and fires staff weapon at the
serpent guards. Guards take cover and return fire. Carter pops up from
undergrowth and fires her MP5 at the serpent guards. They respond to
her fire as well as Teal'c's. Daniel also appears behind a boulder and
fires his beretta at the guards. Apophis looks around him. O'Neill
comes up behind him and takes aim with a rifle. Apophis turns and sees
him. Activates a personal defence shield as O'Neill fires. Apophis
calls to Jaffa for a staff weapon, which is thrown towards him. Apophis
lets the personal defence shield down for a second to catch the staff
weapon as O'Neill fires at him again. Apophis then turns and fires it
at jack. The blast catches jack on the back and he falls to the ground.
Carter and Daniel see O'Neill has been hit.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[Carter leaps out from behind her cover, and is shot in the stomach by
Apophis. Daniel also leaps from behind cover and is shot by apophis. He
tumbles to the ground. Teal'c is still shooting at the serpent guards.
He breaks from cover, firing at Apophis who still has his personal
defence shield in place.]

No argument from me.
TEAL'C
This Goa'uld Nirrti, he once sent an emissary of peace to negotiate
a treaty concerning a Stargate Apophis had control of. The
negotiation was a ploy. The Stargate was destroyed.

Why did you not speak before?
CRYSTAL
Fear.

Fear of what?
CRYSTAL
The Goa'uld came to our planet long ago. We were not afraid then,
and we tried to greet them. One of them touched us as you did and
was destroyed by our energy.

Admittedly, these Goa'uld are a dangerous race.
TEAL'C
More dangerous than you could possibly know.
KINSEY
Ah well, if they're so strong, why did you switch sides in the first
place?
[Kinsey walks to window overlooking the Stargate.]
TEAL'C
Because what is right cannot be measured by strength. Your world
values freedom. I wish that very same freedom for my people.
KINSEY
Well, I don't want to appear callous, sir, but I believe that's your
problem, not ours.
TEAL'C
(gets up and walks towards Kinsey)
It will soon be yours as well, Senator Kinsey. For the Goa'uld are
as powerful as they are evil. The Goa'uld have enslaved a galaxy of
worlds.
KINSEY
I don't care about other worlds. I must place the citizens of this
country first.
[He points to USA flag pin on his lapel.]
TEAL'C
Then you would be wise to heed our warnings, Senator Kinsey. For
when the Goa'uld finally do come in force, and they will, your
citizens as the strongest, most powerful country of this world, will
be among the first to die.

FRAISER
An injection? You...You mean you want more sedative? You've already
had more than the maximum safe dosage, twice as much as anyone else
because you've been more violent.
O'NEILL
Give.
FRAISER
No,it's not safe.
O'NEILL
Give! Give.
FRAISER
Why are you so insistent?
[She gestures for syringe and gives O'Neill another shot of sedative.
O'Neill loses consciousness.]
FRAISER
Must have been in a lot of pain.
[She starts to walk away.]
O'NEILL
Doc!
FRAISER
Colonel O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Me. Me...me...
FRAISER
So you are still in there somewhere?
O'NEILL
Dream? A dream?
FRAISER
(shaking her head)
I'm afraid not, Colonel. It's very real. This is interesting; enough
sedative must knock back the primitive mind. Colonel, listen to me.
I am not going to be able to keep you at this level for very long.
It is too dangerous. It could cause permanent brain damage.
O'NEILL
Wha...what is it?
FRAISER
It's a parasitic virus. All we can tell is that it seems to mess
with the body chemicals, all them. Testosterone levels skyrocket,
thus the aggressive behaviour. It's a histaminolitic which means it
breaks down the histamine.
O'NEILL
Exp...peri...ment.
FRAISER
What?
O'NEILL
Exp...eriment on me.
FRAISER
Experiment on you? No, sir, I can't do that.
O'NEILL
Use me.
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
O'NEILL
We saved an entire race of people. I'd call that a success, sir.
KINSEY
But if you hadn't been able to find a cure so readily, if it had
reached the general population, if the effects weren't reversible.
Colonel O'Neill, you very nearly died on yet another occasion when
infected by...
SAMUELS
Nanocytes, sir.
FLASHBACK--1.09 "BRIEF CANDLE"
INT--ARGOS GATE ROOM
[The Gate is dialing up. Daniel gathers books and runs down the
stairs.]
DANIEL
Jack! Carter's coming back.
(he runs off to the hallway)
Jack!
[O'Neill walks into the room. He has aged significantly since last
seen. Carter emerges from wormhole carrying a large case. She comes
down the stairs and slows at bottom of them, staring at the colonel.]
O'NEILL
Welcome back, Captain. So what did you find out? Oh, come on now,
don't keep the elderly waiting. It's rude.
CARTER
It isn't a virus.
O'NEILL
All right, what is it?
CARTER
Well, Doctor Fraiser and I came up empty. She's still working on it.
But it's going to take time.
DANIEL
Time is something these people don't have, Captain.
O'NEILL
Nor do I.
CARTER
Colonel, there's something else. Your blood samples showed way more
organisms compared to the Argosians.
O'NEILL
How many more?
CARTER
Maybe on the level of a hundred times more. And they are
multiplying.
O'NEILL
Cut to it, Captain.
CARTER
At the rate you're changing, by the end of two weeks you'll be the
equivalent of 100 years old.
INT--SGC, MED LAB
CARTER
We've given the nanocytes some live tissue to interact with, but
they aren't touching it. The only thing they appear to do is make
more of themselves. So how are they causing the aging on Argos?
FRAISER
Maybe there's something on Argos that they need to make them do
another task. Something in the air or with the food.
[Nanocytes start eating away at the gloves Carter is wearing.]
CARTER
Ugh!
[She whips hands out of gloves and closes the contamination chamber
with nanocytes in it. Alarms begin to sound.]
TEAL'C
(from observation room)
Is there a problem, Captain Carter?
CARTER
I--I don't know.
FRAISER
Well, it's eating through the rubber.
CARTER
Oh, God.
[She washes her hands.]
INT--OBSERVATION CHAMBER
[Daniel and Teal'c are observing.]
INT--MED LAB
FRAISER
What? What is it?
CARTER
They are trying to spread.
INT--OBSERVATION CHAMBER
[Daniel and Teal'c are observing.]
INT--ARGOS GATE ROOM
CARTER
We're working with computer simulations and practical simulations.
Realistically, sir, I'm afraid it might take years.
[O'Neill sitting on steps looking at mini video player with message
from Carter, Daniel and Teal'c. He has aged significantly, with long
white hair.]
DANIEL
The general says that Gate travel to Argos is strictly off limits
for the next few, uh, millennia. But we can send objects through, so
if you need anything, just call.
(to Teal'c)
Say something.
TEAL'C
Colonel, I've learned very much from you. Thank you.
CARTER
You know, goodbyes really suck.
[O'Neill rewinds the tape.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
KINSEY
As I understand it, you almost lost containment, Captain Carter.
CARTER
Yes. They tried to mutate in the lab. But after the incident, the
general ordered all samples of the nanocyte destroyed.
KINSEY
And what about next time?
CARTER
There won't be a next time. The nanocytes, the transmitter devices,
everything that tampered with the population of that world has been
destroyed.
DANIEL
In fact, SG-2 just made contact with Kynthia's planet just a few
weeks ago. They are living long, productive lives because of us. Now
I am very proud of what we did there.
O'NEILL
I might even retire there.
KINSEY
(laughs)
You have no fear of it, do you, Colonel? It's like a game to you.
O'NEILL
No, sir. Anything as powerful as the Stargate deserves respect. We
know how dangerous it is to do what we do. We also know how
important it is.
KINSEY
Colonel O'Neill! You're like reckless children, and you're playing
with fire.
O'NEILL
If you shut down this program now, when it's needed most...
KINSEY
For what?
CARTER
To gather technology, weapons.
KINSEY
Not at this price, or this level of competence.
HAMMOND
My people are the best out there, Senator.
KINSEY
I'm sorry, General, but your best is not good enough. I do not
approve of nor support this endeavour, and I have heard nothing here
today that would change my mind. I intend to shut the Stargate down.
[Kinsey nods to Samuels, gathers papers and leaves. Samuels looks smug.
Daniel gets up from the table and blocks Senator Kinsey's path out of
the room.]
DANIEL
Senator, please. Listen to me.
SAMUELS
I think he's made up his mind, Doctor Jackson.
DANIEL
You want your one reason, I'll give it to you. What if I told you I
knew that they were coming, in ships? What if I said that a ship
larger than the great pyramids was gong to land right on top of this
mountain in a matter of weeks, maybe days?
KINSEY
Then I would be curious to know why you've waited until this moment
before saying so.
DANIEL
Because I didn't think anyone would believe me. And if I didn't live
through it myself, I'm not sure I would. But it is a fact. And if
you shut this program down, you will have robbed us of our one
chance to stop them before they get here.
KINSEY
Uh, where did you learn this information?
DANIEL
On our last mission. We came across a civilisation with a level of
technology similar to our own. They had been wiped out. They left
behind a warning. "Beware the Destroyers". Now along with that
warning, came a set of numbers, coordinates that indicate where the
final Goa'uld attack will be launched from.
[He shows his crumpled paper.]
KINSEY
And did all of you witness this warning?
DANIEL
No, sir, they didn't. Just me.
CARTER
Sir. We think Daniel may have experienced an interdimensional
transfer to an alternate reality.
KINSEY
I beg your pardon?
DANIEL
The moment I touched an alien artefact on 233, I was separated from
the rest of the team. I was actually transported to an alternate
reality where Earth was already under Goa'uld attack. I got this
when I was there.
KINSEY
(disbelieving laughter)
My heaven. I've heard enough of this.
DANIEL
Senator! The Goa'uld were bombarding our cities from space. We were
defenceless against their weapons.
KINSEY
Doctor Jackson, I do not suffer fools gladly.
DANIEL
Nor do I, Senator, and I'm telling you, when we killed Ra two years
ago, we set into motion a chain of events that will eventually lead
to an all out attack on Earth by the Goa'uld.
KINSEY
If this is so, why have they waited?
TEAL'C
It would take time for Apophis to assemble the necessary forces.
DANIEL
Right. Their society is feudal. It would take time to build an army.
Look, all I know is the location that they're going to launch the
final attack from. If you don't believe me, just let us dial in the
coordinates and let us go there and find out.
KINSEY
How many ships, Dr. Jackson? Has anyone detected their approach?
DANIEL
Uh, I can't be sure of the exact details. I mean there were, there
were differences between that reality and...and this one.
KINSEY
Oh, of course there were.
DANIEL
I am not crazy.
KINSEY
Nor am I, Dr. Jackson. Neither am I unused to eleventh hour pleas.
Though never have I heard one so desperate as this.
DANIEL
Senator. They are coming.
KINSEY
Then I say, let them come.
O'NEILL
Where do you get this bureaucratic bull? You're talking suicide.
KINSEY
Colonel O'Neill. You underestimate this great nation.
TEAL'C
It is you who underestimates the enemy. We have challenged Apophis.
He will not rest until the people of this world worship him as their
god.
KINSEY
There is only one God, sir. And I do not believe for one moment that
He will allow what you are trying to tell me to come to pass. We are
after all, one nation under God.
O'NEILL
(stands)
And you think God is going to save us?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld believe they are gods. And your beliefs will not
dissuade them.
KINSEY
If the Goa'uld do come, then we will be able to tell them that we
have buried our 'gate in the ground forever and will never step
through it again. If they challenge us, we shall prevail.
DANIEL
You're a fool.
KINSEY
And if they do not come, which I think is infinitely more likely,
then at least Pandora's box will have finally been closed once and
for all. Now if you will excuse me, I have business to attend to.
[Kinsey leaves, followed by aides.]
SAMUELS
For what it's worth, I'm sorry it had to end like this.
HAMMOND
Get out of here!
[Samuels leaves.]
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I would like to request permission to return
through the Stargate before it is permanently sealed. If this world
does not intend to continue its struggle against the Goa'uld, then
here I do not belong.
O'NEILL
I think I'm going with him.
HAMMOND
I can't allow that, Colonel. I'm sorry, but you know that. The
President has made it perfectly clear if we were unable to convince
the Senator we would cease operations effective immediately.
CARTER
Sir, there are still two SG teams offworld.
HAMMOND
We'll keep the light on until they return. But that's all I'm
authorised to do.
O'NEILL
So...what? That's it?
HAMMOND
That's it, Colonel.
CARTER
It can't be.
O'NEILL
With all due respect, sir, it's...
DANIEL
Sir, with all due respect, the good senator is an ass.
HAMMOND
He is an elected official of the government we are sworn to serve.
Whether we agree or disagree, he's made his decision. Our
commander-in-chief has given us our orders accordingly. I expect you
all to carry them out. Dismissed.
[Hammond leaves room.]
