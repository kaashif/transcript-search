TEASER
INT--ISOLATION LAB, SGC
[Carter works on Merlin's transdimensional device using her laptop and
a naquadah generator, all on a table in the center of the lab. Various
other equipment surrounds her. The door slides open, and Mitchell
enters.]
MITCHELL
Hey, Sam how...
CARTER
Wait!
[At the same time as she cries out, Mitchell hits a force shield face
first, knocking him back slightly.]
MITCHELL
Ow!
[Carter winces in sympathy.]
CARTER
Oh! Sorry.
[Mitchell rubs his face as Carter frantically types on her keyboard.
The force shield lowers.]
MITCHELL
What the hell was that?!
CARTER
Force shield. Didn't you see my sign?
MITCHELL
No!
(He enters the room)
Yes!
[He pointedly grabs a piece of paper from the edge of the table and
holds it up. It reads in large black handwritten letters: "DO NOT
ENTER! FORCE SHIELD ACTIVE".]
MITCHELL
You mean, this sign?
CARTER
(chuckling)
That was supposed to be out...
MITCHELL
Yeah, I got that. Is there any particular reason why you turned this
place into Fort Knox?
CARTER
I'm attempting to rewrite the safety protocols on Merlin's device so
we can take even larger areas out of phase. I set up a two way force
shield to restrict the range of the device and to ensure that nobody
entered the field accidentally.
[She chuckles as Mitchell rubs his nose again.]
MITCHELL
Yep. Very effective.
CARTER
Any news on Daniel?
MITCHELL
No, the latest sighting by the Jaffa turned out to be a false alarm.
But Teal'c just got back, so we are going to grab some lunch and go
over the report.
[Mitchell grabs Carter's arm and attempts to pull her away from her
work. She stays put and raises her index finger.]
CARTER
Okay, just let me run one more test!
MITCHELL
No.
CARTER
It'll only take a minute, I promise. You can watch from up there.
[She gestures to the observation room.]
MITCHELL
I'm going to be timing you.
CARTER
Mm-hmm.
[Carter waves him away and starts typing as Mitchell grabs the sign and
exits the room. The force shield activates again as the door closes.
Mitchell enters the observation room and taps at his watch. Carter
smiles and waves. After a few moments, Mitchell sees Carter and all the
equipment in the lab go out of phase. He waits and watches the now
seemingly empty room.]
[Out of phase, Carter begins to hear a strange whining noise. She looks
around, trying to trace its source. She adjusts the leads on Merlin's
device, then notices a strange glow coming from near the naquadah
reactor. She stops touching the equipment and as she watches, she and
all the equipment in the lab seem to be sucked into the glow.]
[Mitchell continues to observe the empty room, unaware of anything out
of the ordinary. After a few more minutes he keys the microphone.]
MITCHELL
Sam, I know you can hear me. Time's up.
[He waits a few more moments, then grows concerned, keying the
microphone again.]
MITCHELL
Sam?
INT--ISOLATION LAB, STARGATE COMMAND, ALTERNATE UNIVERSE
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: Until otherwise indicated, all scene changes and
characters other than Carter are of an alternate universe.
[Carter regains consciousness to find herself lying on the floor of a
darkened lab. Klaxons and buzzers sound. She stands up to find her lab
equipment still intact around her, though the floor has scorch marks as
if the lab was the center of a blast. She looks up to find the
observation room empty. She hears voices coming closer from just
outside the door. She lowers the force shield just before Dr. Lee and a
guard enter. Lee looks around in surprise.]
LEE
Major, uh, are you okay? We-we heard an explosion.
CARTER
Yeah, I'm fine...did you just call me "Major"?
[Lorne runs into the room.]
LORNE
Sam, thank God you're okay. Where's Dr. Bennett?
CARTER
Major Lorne, what are you doing here?
LORNE
Whaddya mean?
CARTER
(laughing nervously)
You're supposed to be on Atlantis.
LORNE
Sam, what are you talking about?
CARTER
You're on assignment in the Pegasus Galaxy.
[Lee looks from Sam to the equipment more and more confused. Carter
looks from Lorne to Lee with amusement, as if waiting for the
punchline.]
LORNE
Uh, are you sure you're okay? Because I work here. Remember?...As
leader of SG-1.
[Sam is shocked.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Breathless, Lorne runs into the control room to brief the base
commander, Major General George Hammond.]
LORNE
General, we have a problem.
HAMMOND
What is it, Major?
LORNE
I'm not exactly sure how to explain this, sir, but...there's been an
accident. It's Sam.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28
[Lorne continues briefing Hammond as they walk through the corridor.]
LORNE
She claims she's not the Major Carter we know.
HAMMOND
What's that supposed to mean?
LORNE
She says she's from a parallel universe. And given the nature of the
experiments--
[The reach a large door labeled Central Sector 08, Level 28. A guard
slides a key card through for them.]
HAMMOND
(interrupting)
Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. You said there was an
explosion. Was she injured?
[The door rises, and they both continue walking.]
LORNE
Uh, not a scratch, sir. But she does seem different.
HAMMOND
Different how?
LORNE
Well, for one thing, she claims she's a lieutenant colonel. And she
does have this device with her I've never seen before. We have no
idea where that came from.
HAMMOND
All right, assuming for the moment she's telling the truth: where's
our Major Carter?
LORNE
We don't know.
HAMMOND
Find out!
LORNE
Yes, sir.
[They part ways.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM SOUTH SECTION 11, LEVEL 16
[Lorne and Carter sit in chairs on opposite sides of a small table in
an interrogation room guarded by two SFs. A large video camera is set
up recording Carter.]
LORNE
So, why are you here?
CARTER
I didn't do it on purpose, believe me.
LORNE
What about that machine you brought with you?
CARTER
(sighing)
It demolecularizes matter and transports it to another dimension.
LORNE
Well, there you go.
CARTER
No, no, this is different! Look, according to M theory, there are a
fixed number of alternate dimensions existing in parallel with our
known universe. The multiverse theory, on the other hand, posits the
existence of an infinite number of alternate universes, each
evolving concurrently with our own.
LORNE
Well, is there a universe out there somewhere where you're giving me
a straight answer?
[Carter sighs in frustration.]
CARTER
Look, there must be some reason why I was brought here, of all
places. I need to know what was happening in that lab.
LORNE
I'm not authorized to give you that information.
CARTER
(groaning)
Okay, maybe I could talk to Daniel. Is he here?
LORNE
Dr. Jackson was captured by the forces of the Ori several weeks ago.
CARTER
Okay, what about Col. Mitchell? Cameron Mitchell?
LORNE
(puzzled)
The 302 pilot? Went down over Antarctica?
CARTER
That's right. Is he here?
LORNE
I have no idea where he is. The last I heard, he quit the military.
CARTER
Teal'c!? Vala?
LORNE
Teal'c went back to the Jaffa several years ago, and if you're
talking about Vala Mal Doran, I hate to break it to you, but she is
currently occupying a cell at Area 51. Care to take a stab at anyone
else?
[Carter leans back in her chair, thinking desperately.]
CARTER
At least let me see the surveillance footage from the lab. There may
be a clue.
[Lorne's expression is closed, and he glances over at the camera.
Carter turns directly to the lens of the camera recording her.]
CARTER
(pleading)
Look, I know you want your Carter back as much as I want to go
home...
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and Lee watch the footage of Carter's interrogation on a
monitor.]
CARTER
(continuing on screen)
...but we stand a much better chance of figuring this out if we work
together.
HAMMOND
Show her the footage.
[He walks away. Lee looks surprised, shaking his head.]
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
[The Carter from the alternate universe and Dr. Bennett work on several
pieces of equipment in the isolation lab.]
BENNETT
We're getting a power spike!
CARTER
Capacitors are overloading. Shut it down.
[She starts typing on a laptop; there is a blinding flash of light.
Sparks start to fly.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16
[Carter winces while she watches the surveillance footage of her
alternate and the other scientist.]
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
BENNETT
Override's not responding!
CARTER
Bennett, get out of here!
[There's another flash, and the screen goes snowy.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16
[Lee sits across the table from her. Lorne stands nearby.]
LEE
That's all we got. Sensors indicate there was a massive explosion in
the room. But when we opened the door, instead of finding charred
remains, we found you.
CARTER
What were the capacitors for?
[Lee looks to Lorne, who nods in approval.]
LEE
(sighing)
Major Carter was developing a process by which we could extract
energy from parallel universes.
CARTER
(to Lorne)
And you knew about this?
LORNE
Uh, knowing and understanding, two totally different things.
LEE
Ordinarily, this type of energy retrieval is extremely dangerous,
leading to the creation of exotic particles in one or both
universes.
CARTER
(swallowing and nodding)
I know, we've tried it.
LEE
Oh. Well our Major Carter found a way around that. She designed the
machine so the bridge would only open for a microsecond. The idea
was to steal small amounts of energy from thousands of different
universes, thereby minimizing the fallout in any single one.
LORNE
Anyway, it doesn't entirely explain how you got here.
LEE
That's true. The device was never designed to bring ordinary matter
through the bridge.
CARTER
Well, I was conducting an experiment of my own. At the precise
moment that your Carter tapped into my reality, the entire contents
of my lab were out of phase, and they were being protected by a
force shield.
LEE
Oh my God! Well it-there's no telling what effect that would have on
the inter-universal bridge.
CARTER
Well, presumably, it pulled me through and caused the capacitors on
this side to overload.
[Lee looks upset.]
LORNE
Well, if it brought you here, is it possible that it sent our Carter
to your universe?
[Lee and Carter exchange grave looks.]
CARTER
I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.
[Lorne walks away, upset.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 27
[Hammond meets Chief of Staff Charlie outside a door. Portraits of
founding fathers, a small waiting area, and other decor are in this
area of the base. Charlie is shutting a door behind him.]
CHARLIE
General.
HAMMOND
I need to see the President.
CHARLIE
He's on a call. Can it wait?
HAMMOND
No.
[Charlie nods.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16
[Carter sits at the table. The door opens, and Hammond and Lorne enter.
Carter rises to attention in surprise.]
CARTER
General Hammond!
HAMMOND
Colonel.
CARTER
You're in command here?
HAMMOND
That's right.
CARTER
I'm sorry, sir. It's just a little strange. The General Hammond I
know is retired from active service.
HAMMOND
Well, then he's a lucky man. Please...
[He gestures for her to sit. She complies as he sits in the chair
across from her. Lorne sits on the table.]
HAMMOND
I know this must be difficult for you, Colonel. It's difficult for
us as well. In fact, the timing couldn't be worse.
CARTER
What do you mean?
LORNE
Three weeks ago, the Ori attempted an attack on Earth.
CARTER
You survived an Ori attack?!
HAMMOND
One ship. We fought them off with the Ancient chair. The ZPM was
nearly depleted in the process.
LORNE
That's why our Major Carter was running that experiment. She was
trying to bolster our power reserves with captured energy from other
universes.
CARTER
And of course, you only have the one ZPM, cause you've never
received new ones from Atlantis.
[Hammond turns to Lorne, puzzled.]
LORNE
Atlantis. You've mentioned them before. What is that?
CARTER
It's a city of the Ancients in the Pegasus Galaxy. In my reality, we
have an international contingent there.
HAMMOND
I don't know about your reality, Colonel, but in this world, there
isn't much in the way of international cooperation. Three years ago,
the Goa'uld system lord Anubis launched an attack on Earth. We had
no choice but to reveal the existence of the Stargate program to the
world.
LORNE
People panicked. There was rioting in the streets. The President had
to declare martial law.
HAMMOND
The diplomatic fallout was even worse. You can imagine how the
world's governments reacted when they realized the kind of
technology being employed by the United States military.
LORNE
Mm-hmm. We barely got the chair out of Antarctica before the
Russians moved in.
HAMMOND
Now it's at Area 51. But it isn't going to do us much good unless we
can find a way to power it. And that's where you come in.
CARTER
You want me to complete your Carter's research.
HAMMOND
Major Lorne tells me you've been conducting similar research in your
own universe.
CARTER
Well, yes sir. But, with all due respect, we're facing a very real
threat in my universe. I need to start thinking about how to get
back there.
HAMMOND
Let's say we agreed to help you get back, and gave you full access
to the resources of this base. How long would it take?
CARTER
(shrugging)
I don't know. I don't even have a working theory yet.
HAMMOND
Well, are we talking weeks? Or maybe even months?
CARTER
Yeah, it's possible. That's why I need to get started right away.
[Hammond shakes his head.]
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, Colonel, but the fact is, we don't have that kind of
time. Our intelligence indicates that having consolidated their
position in this part of the galaxy, the Ori are assembling a fleet
for a full scale attack on Earth. We expect them within five days.
[Carter reacts to this news with an expression of fear and shock.]
INT--OBSERVATION ROOM, ISOLATION LAB, SGC
[Hammond and Lorne enter the room. Lee is already there. On a screen is
a schematic of Merlin's device. Carter is in the lab below.]
HAMMOND
What's this about, Doctor?
LEE
(scoffing)
I'm not entirely sure. She says she wants to show us something.
[Hammond keys the microphone to speak to Carter down in the lab. She
has a naquadah reactor powered and is working with the interdimensional
device.]
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
I thought you agreed to help us, Colonel?
CARTER
Yes, sir. But after talking to Dr. Lee, I realized it was a mistake
for me to pursue your Carter's research.
[Hammond turns to Lee, who stammers half-spoken protests and shakes his
head. Hammond turns back to the microphone.]
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
May I ask why?
CARTER
Well, it would take to long to get me up to speed, and to be
perfectly honest, sir, I'm not totally convinced that I could make
it work.
[Lorne keys the other microphone.]
LORNE
(to Carter)
Do you have another suggestion?
CARTER
Yes, I do. This.
[She presses a button, and she and all the equipment in the lab
disappear.]
LORNE
What the hell?
[Lee puts his hand to his mouth and shakes his head in disbelief.]
HAMMOND
(to Lee)
Doctor?
[After a few more moments, Carter and the equipment reappear.]
LEE
How...?
HAMMOND
(into microphone)
Colonel, what just happened?
CARTER
I was taken out of phase, sir. Invisible and untouchable. And based
on experiments in my own reality, one hundred percent Ori-proof.
LORNE
(into microphone)
No offense, Sam, but how does hiding one lab full of equipment help
us?
CARTER
Well, the field size can be manipulated. That's what I was working
on when I was brought here. Our plan was to hide the entire planet.
[Lorne and Hammond turn to Lee. He rubs his beard, looking thoughtful.]
LEE
Y-y-yeah.
[He nods and shrugs in approval.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Lorne pauses outside the door, and observes Carter bent over a laptop
inside the lab. After a moment, he enters.]
LORNE
Hey. How's it coming?
CARTER
Oh, okay, I guess. I was just about to run my first simulation.
LORNE
Hmph. You know, it's kinda weird seeing you in here.
CARTER
It's a little weird being in here
LORNE
Yeah.
CARTER
It's the same, but it's different, you know?
[The exchange awkward looks as Carter crosses her arms in front of her
and fidgets.]
CARTER
Can I ask you something?
LORNE
Yeah, sure.
[Carter gets up and goes over to get a bag off a shelf.]
CARTER
I found these pictures, and, uh, in them, she was wearing a wedding
ring.
[She hands a picture to Lorne. It is of Lorne and the Carter of this
alternate universe. They are both smiling, wearing casual clothing and
she has longer hair. The alternate-Carter's left hand is clearly
visible off Lorne's shoulder.]
LORNE
(laughing in remembrance)
Yeah, that must have been before the divorce.
CARTER
So...
[Carter points between the Carter in the picture and Lorne.]
LORNE
Oh, no-no-no-no. God, no. No, it was this dot com millionaire
smartass named McKay.
CARTER
(eyes wide)
Not...Rodney McKay?
LORNE
Yeah. You have one too, huh? Is he a jerk in your universe?
CARTER
(awkwardly)
Huh. Some people think so.
LORNE
Sam always said there was a side of him that no one else saw.
[Carter swallows in distaste.]
INT--SGC ELEVATOR AND CORRIDOR
[Hammond enters an elevator. As the doors close, Carter comes running
up.]
CARTER
General!
HAMMOND
Colonel.
[Carter enters the elevator.]
CARTER
I was just coming to see you.
HAMMOND
I know. I already spoke to Dr. Lee this morning.
CARTER
Then you know our power calculations are coming up short. The battle
with the Ori ships simply taxed the ZPM too much. I'm sorry, sir. I
think I may have traded one power requirement problem for another.
HAMMOND
Not necessarily.
[The elevator doors open, and Hammond waves Carter to exit.]
INT--LEVEL 27 CORRIDOR
[Carter and Hammond walk through the corridors. Carter looks around at
men in suits and the paintings decorating the walls.]
CARTER
Sir, who are these people?
HAMMOND
Secret service.
CARTER
Er, since when have you had secret service outside your office?
HAMMOND
Hasn't been my office for three years.
[The door to the briefing room is opened for them, and they enter.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM/CABINET ROOM
[Presidential Cabinet members and military personnel sit around the
table as aides mill nearby. Landry, wearing a suit, approaches and
reaches out to shake Carter's hand.]
LANDRY
Colonel! Nice to finally get to meet you.
HAMMOND
Colonel Carter, President Landry.
CARTER
President!? Of the United States?
LANDRY
That's right. Is there a problem?
CARTER
Uh, no sir, it's just...never mind.
LANDRY
I understand you're dealing with a little power shortage. How much
do you need?
CARTER
Uh, well, about 700 gigawatts. That's roughly eighty percent of the
power generating capacity of the continental United States.
LANDRY
So, it's doable then.
CARTER
(gulping)
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
HAMMOND
We've known about the condition of the ZPM for some time, Colonel.
In addition to our Major Carter's research, as a backup we've been
building an infrastructure to channel energy to the Ancient chair
directly from the U.S. power grid.
[Landry finishes signing some papers an aide brought him, then leads
Hammond and Carter to the table.]
LANDRY
Not enough to give us the upper hand in a shooting battle against a
whole fleet, but if your plan works, there won't be any battles at
all.
(to Charlie)
Charlie, I need a speech explaining to the American people why it's
a good thing they'll be without power for an undisclosed period of
time.
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
(to Carter)
Pack your things; you're going to Area 51.
[Landry turns away. Carter looks nonplussed.]
INT--PRESIDENT LANDRY'S OFFICE
[President Landry's office is decorated with a copy of the Preamble of
the Constitution, some more colonial portraits, and other patriotic
paraphernalia. Currently, it is filled with aides and camera and light
equipment for the upcoming speech. A teleprompter has already been set
up with the opening of Landry's comments. A makeup artist touches up
Landry's forehead. Charlie, Landry's Chief of Staff, enters.]
CHARLIE
We're ready, sir.
LANDRY
All right. Let's do it.
[The floor director counts down to the live feed and cues Landry.]
LANDRY
My fellow Americans and citizens of all nations, tonight our world
faces a grave threat. The same hostile forces that recently attacked
us without warning or provocation are again massing for another
assault. Let me assure you that we intend to meet this aggression as
we did previously with unwavering resolve and fully confident that
we will once again emerge victorious.
INT--AREA 51 LAB
[Landry's speech continues on a television monitor in the background
while Carter and other scientists work. Carter is by her equipment
while Lee works on something behind the Ancient chair.]
LANDRY
(on television)
In order to achieve this victory, we will need to divert a
significant portion of our electrical generating capacity to a
government facility in the Nevada desert.
LEE
Okay, try it now.
[Carter taps some keys on her laptop and shakes her head negatively.]
CARTER
We're still getting too much variance.
LEE
Ah, damn it. Uh, give me a sec.
[He moves to a computer.]
LANDRY
(on television)
Remain calm. Stay in your homes. Listen for instructions on your
local civil defense broadcasts...
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry's broadcast appears on a television in the control room. Major
Lorne stands near the control desk monitoring communications on a
wireless headset as Hammond rushes in.]
LANDRY
(on television)
...and we will see this through. These are difficult times.
HAMMOND
What've we got?
LORNE
Daedalus just reported that five Ori ships have breached the safe
zone.
[Hammond turns to the television and watches Landry's speech.]
LANDRY
(on television)
But I believe that out of adversity, greatness is born. And with
your help, we will emerge from this stronger and more unified than
ever before.
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
LANDRY
(continuing speech)
Thank you, and God bless us all.
FLOOR DIRECTOR
And...we're out.
CHARLIE
Well done, sir.
[Landry sighs. As the technicians pack up the video equipment, Landry
remains at his desk. Now that the cameras are off, he looks overwhelmed
and distraught.]
INT--AREA 51 LAB
LEE
That's it. All systems are in the green.
CARTER
All right, let's plug it in.
[Lee presses a final button on a laptop, and both watch a screen on the
wall showing the power input increasing up to twenty percent and
counting.]
EXT--U.S. CITY, NIGHT
[Lights begin to go out in a major American city.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[Lights can be seen flickering out throughout the continental United
States just as five Ori warships approach the planet.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LORNE
SATCOM reports contact, sir. Multiple targets.
HAMMOND
(to technicians)
Get me Colonel Carter.
INT--AREA 51 LAB
[On a laptop Carter and Lee watch the Ancient chair's power input
level.]
HAMMOND
(over radio)
Colonel, you're out of time.
CARTER
We're almost there, sir. Capacitors are loading.
[Lee glances over to the power input screen.]
LEE
Seventy-five percent and climbing!
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LORNE
The enemy ships are splitting up. Two of them are taking up position
over Area 51.
HAMMOND
It's now or never, Colonel.
CARTER
(over radio)
This is an all or nothing proposition, sir...
INT--AREA 51 LAB
CARTER
(continuing)
...If we initiate without sufficient power, the field will just
collapse.
LEE
We're at eighty-five percent.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LEE
(over radio)
Ninety...
INT--AREA 51 LAB
[Lee watches as the numbers increase, but at a slower and slower rate.]
LEE
(to Carter)
Ninety-two. It's slowing down. We're not going to make it.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
Your position is about to be compromised! Colonel?
INT--AREA 51 LAB
LEE
Ninety-three percent. That's got to be close enough.
CARTER
I guess we're about to find out.
[They activate the device. A bright light flashes and spreads as a wave
outward.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The wave of light passes across the control room.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[As the Ori ships draw closer, the entire planet disappears from view.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
Major, what's our status?
LORNE
No movement, sir. The ships are just hovering there.
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[The Ori warships start firing their weapons to the space where Earth
was.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
LORNE
They're opening fire, sir! Looks like they think we're just cloaked.
INT--AREA 51 LAB
[Bright orange energy lights pass directly through the lab and everyone
there. They are all startled, and after a second, Carter grins.
Eventually the light disappears.]
LEE
Whoa, wow, what the hell was that?
CARTER
Ori weapons fire--passing right through us!
LEE
Oh! Oh man! Geez!
[Elated, Lee laughs and gives Carter a bear hug, catching her
off-guard.]
CARTER
O-kay.
[Lee releases her, both looking a bit awkward, but still relieved.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28
[Carter walks with President Landry through the corridor. Several aides
follow.]
LANDRY
We owe you a debt of gratitude, Colonel.
CARTER
I'm glad I could help, sir.
LANDRY
I suppose now, you'll want to start working on a way to get back to
your own universe.
CARTER
I already have, actually, although I'm not having much luck.
LANDRY
I'm sure you'll figure it out. In the meantime, there are a few
people I'd like you to meet.
[The door to the Gate room opens. Carter is shocked by a mob of
reporters flashing cameras and jockeying for positions, calling out
questions to "Major Carter".]
LANDRY
Smile, you're a hero.
[Carter stands dumbfounded at the attention.]
INT--LIMOUSINE, WASHINGTON, D.C., NIGHT
[Carter sits in the back of a limousine. She wears a low-cut floor
length black cocktail dress and is bedecked in a diamond choker
necklace and diamond earrings. She has on the limousine's television
and watches footage of the Gate room press conference with herself and
President Landry behind a podium.]
LANDRY
(on television)
I can't tell you how fortunate I am to have men and women like Major
Carter on my team. And I'm confident that with their help and your
continued support, we will prevail through the difficult times that
lie ahead.
[The television screen switches to anchorwoman Julia Donovan ending the
story.]
DONOVAN
(on television)
That was the scene yesterday at Stargate Command as President Landry
introduced the world to the Air Force Major responsible for the
brilliant plan that saved the planet...
[Carter's cell phone rings. After glancing at the phone, she turns off
the television and answers the phone.]
CARTER
Bill, tell me you have good news!
INT--SGC LAB
LEE
(despondent)
The preliminary simulations were a bust. There's just no way we can
replicate the conditions that originally brought you here. Not
unless we can control the environment on both sides of the bridge.
INT--LIMOUSINE
CARTER
(sighing)
All right, I'll be back tomorrow. We can go over it then. Bye.
[She hangs up her phone and stuffs it into her handbag as the limousine
comes to a stop. The door opens and paparazzi flash their cameras and
shout questions as secret service agents escort her down a red carpet.]
INT--BANQUET ROOM, WHITE HOUSE
[Men and women mingle at a cocktail reception. The women are all
dressed formally and the men all wear tuxedos. A senator and his wife
stand making small talk with Carter.]
SENATOR
Major, it's an honor. On behalf of the people of the great state of
Idaho, thank you.
CARTER
(embarrassed)
Oh, well...you're very kind, sir.
SENATOR'S WIFE
Keep up the good work, dear.
CARTER
Thank you.
[The senator and his wife move on, the senator unobtrusively leering at
Carter's cleavage as he passes. Carter looks around, feeling very out
of place.]
LANDRY
Enjoying the party?
CARTER
Uh...I'm not sure that's exactly the right word, sir.
LANDRY
Have some champagne. Relax.
CARTER
I guess I'm just not used to all the attention.
[Landry raises his eyebrows.]
LANDRY
They do things differently where you come from?
CARTER
Well, no, it's not just that. I feel like an impostor, sir. I mean,
these people think that I'm "Major" Samantha Carter.
LANDRY
(chuckling)
That won't be a problem anymore. We're promoting you!
CARTER
Yeah. That's not the point, sir.
LANDRY
People here have been through a lot lately. They need something to
believe in. Your timing is impeccable.
PROTESTOR
No security without freedom! No security without freedom!
[A surprised Landry and Carter turn to find a man dressed in street
clothes, trying to crash the party. He continues to shout his protests
as Charlie comes up to Landry.]
CHARLIE
Sir, let's get you out of here.
[Charlie ushers Landry and Carter to the center part of the room as
secret service agents push the partygoers back towards the wall. Other
secret service agents wrestle with the protestor.]
PROTESTOR
We will NOT be silenced by acts of tyranny. Our voices will be
heard! No security without freedom! No security...!
[Carter watches horrified as the agents use a Goa'uld pain stick on the
protestor, making him cry out in agony. He's dragged away, now limp.]
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Let's get him out of here!
[Seconds later, Carter and Landry are beamed away.]
INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR
[Landry and Carter are beamed just outside President Landry's quarters
on the Prometheus.]
CARTER
(in shock)
Prometheus.
LANDRY
Hmm.
[He nods and walks into his quarters aboard the vessel.]
INT--LANDRY'S CABIN, PROMETHEUS
COLONEL
(over intercom)
Welcome to Air Force One, Mr. President. Is there anything you need?
LANDRY
No, not for the moment, Colonel. Thank you.
(to Carter)
Sorry about that. Want a drink?
CARTER
No...thank you. Sir, what the hell just happened?
LANDRY
My security detail can get a little overprotective. Probably just
could've gone out the back way.
[He pours himself a drink.]
CARTER
Uh, I meant the protestor, sir.
LANDRY
(sighing)
Not everyone is happy about some of the compromises we've had to
make.
CARTER
Compromises like martial law?
LANDRY
Believe me, Colonel, I have no desire to go down in history as the
man who destroyed civil liberties in America. But I think you'll
agree that compared to other Presidents, I've faced some pretty
unique challenges.
[He takes a drink as Carter looks uncomfortable.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter watches a television news report of several buildings in
rubble. She wears an overcoat over casual civilian garb. Hammond
enters.]
HAMMOND
The President's people are looking for you.
CARTER
I was just on my way out.
HAMMOND
(smiling)
They've been getting a lot of requests from the media for you to do
some sit down interviews. Apparently, you've become quite the
celebrity.
CARTER
(gesturing to the television)
Have you seen this? It was an Irish village. It was just bombed by
American F-302s.
[Hammond glances at the television, but does not seem concerned.]
HAMMOND
At the request of the Irish Prime Minister. That "village" as you
call it was in fact a training camp for terrorists bent on
overthrowing several European governments.
CARTER
You know, I've also been going over several mission reports. You
abandoned the Alpha Site. You cut ties with the Jaffa. You pulled
back on almost everything!
HAMMOND
(defensively)
We didn't have a lot of choice! We devoted our full resources to
planetary defense!
CARTER
Well, that's understandable. But now that the Ori attack has failed,
does that mean you'll be getting back out there?
HAMMOND
That decision hasn't been made yet.
CARTER
(sarcastically)
Of course not. I mean, why be hasty, especially when those 302s are
so handy for putting down your political enemies?!
HAMMOND
You know, I understand you're coming to see certain things about
this world that you don't like. To tell the truth, we don't much
like it either. But you weren't here for the riots. You didn't see
American citizens shooting each other over food, water, and
gasoline! Hank Landry brought us back from the brink of chaos!
CARTER
That was three years ago!
HAMMOND
The threat is still out there!
CARTER
That's the problem! It always will be!
[Carter storms out. Hammond remains, lost in thought.]
INT--MCKAY'S OFFICE
[Carter paces McKay's office, absently fingering some of the items he
has on display. The room is very bright and well lit, with one wall
made up entirely of a window. The walls are light grey, the furniture
modern. The pictures on the wall are of architectural structures such
as the Gridiron and Chrysler buildings of New York City.]
MCKAY
Well, well, well. If it isn't the toast of Washington!
CARTER
Hi, Rodney. Thank you for seeing me.
MCKAY
Well, why wouldn't I? I mean, we're still friends, aren't we? Saw
you on TV...well, recorded you, actually...not that I-I watched it
more than once...I mean, I recorded it in order to...watch you
once...
(wincing)
How can I help you?
CARTER
Well, this is going to come as a bit of a shock, but I'm not who you
think I am.
MCKAY
Oh my God, you're a lesbian! Is that what you're trying to tell me?
CARTER
What!? No! McKay!
MCKAY
Well, no, I-I-just...I think..I thought, uh...hmm.
[Carter struggles to shake off her ire.]
CARTER
Och! What I'm trying to tell you is that...I am from an alternate
universe.
MCKAY
Huh.
CARTER
Your Samantha Carter was working on an experiment when she
inadvertently pulled me in.
MCKAY
This some kind of a joke? It's very funny. Who put you up to this?
CARTER
(earnestly)
This is not a joke, McKay. In my reality, you're a key member of a
team of international scientists and explorers based in the Pegasus
Galaxy. You go on dangerous adventures. You deal with high level
alien technology.
MCKAY
Hmm. Sounds like, um, I'm a chump. Nice try, Sam, but, uh, even if
travel between universes was possible, the likelihood of you
surviving is, uh...
CARTER
I was in a force shield when I was pulled through. Your Samantha
Carter was killed in the same accident that brought me here. I'm
sorry to be so blunt about it, but I don't have a lot of time, and I
need your help.
[McKay looks stricken as he realizes Carter is telling the truth.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry and Hammond get briefed by Lee and a group of scientists. On
the table is another "Arthur's Mantle", otherwise known as Merlin's
interdimensional device.]
LANDRY
This one's ours?
LEE
Yes, sir. This one is ours. It was among the artifacts we found in
the cave at Glastonbury, just like she said it was. And-and
remarkably, it has been in storage ever since because we did not
know what it was.
LANDRY
But now that you do know, you can make it work, right?
LEE
Well...we have to understand this is an incredibly complicated piece
of machinery. Our preliminary investigations have revealed that it
is powered by a crystal which sits at the back, here.
(indicates the crystal chamber)
The keys are labeled in Ancient, which we're in the process of
translating. Now, these keys, they appear to operate in the normal
ways that keys do...
(he depresses a key)
up and down...
LANDRY
(interrupting)
Doctor, have you learned anything substantial about the operation of
this machine?
LEE
The operation? Not really, no, sir. In fact the only person who
truly understands this technology is Colonel Carter.
LANDRY
(sighing)
All right, thank you.
LEE
Um, no, thank you, sir.
[Lee indicates to the other scientists they are dismissed and they
gather their materials. As they leave, Hammond approaches Landry.]
HAMMOND
What are we going to do?
LANDRY
We're not going to do anything.
HAMMOND
Mr. President, we told her if she helped us, we'd let her go.
LANDRY
I'm sorry, George, but for the moment, we can't afford to lose her.
She's not going anywhere.
[Hammond nods in acknowledgment.]
INT--MCKAY'S OFFICE
MCKAY
Okay, you need to slow down. You're telling me my ex-wife is dead
even though you look exactly like her...except for the hair, which
is nice, by the way...On top of that, you're from another universe,
and you need me to help you get back?
CARTER
In my reality, you successfully designed and built a bridge between
parallel universes...with a little help from your sister.
MCKAY
Really? What, so, uh, she and I get along in your universe?
CARTER
Not exactly.
MCKAY
(disappointed)
Oh.
CARTER
Anyway, I've been trying my best to recreate your calculations, but
I keep coming up short. That's why I'm here.
MCKAY
I have not done a lot of theoretical physics, lately, okay? I mean,
these days I tend to do a little more of the, uh, buying and selling
of companies!
CARTER
(trying unsuccessfully to look sincere)
The Rodney McKay I know wouldn't back down from a challenge. He is
one of the most forthright, courageous...and selfless men I have
ever met.
MCKAY
(preening)
Hmm.
(his face falls)
Aw, you're making that up, aren't you?
CARTER
Most of it, yeah.
MCKAY
Okay, I'll help you.
[Carter brightens, surprised.]
INT--ISOLATION LAB
[Carter rounds the corner to the lab, speaking before she enters.]
CARTER
Good news, Bill, we've got somebody to help with the...calculations.
[Carter stares around the empty room, finding neither Lee nor any of
her equipment inside.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter storms into the briefing room, headed directly for the
President.]
CARTER
Where's my equipment?
LANDRY
Still at Area 51.
CARTER
It was supposed to be returned once the Ori fleet was gone. I need
it for the defense of my own world.
LANDRY
I'm sorry the timing's not good for you to go back just yet. We'll
revisit your situation after the plebiscite.
CARTER
What plebiscite?
CHARLIE
Last year, Congress was forced to cancel the mid-term elections
because of widespread unrest. It was supposed to be temporary, but
when things didn't improve, we voted to suspend elections
indefinitely. Now it comes down to a simple yes or no vote to put
the President in office.
LANDRY
You're a member of my team! The woman who saved the world. Do you
have any idea what kind of political capital that's worth?
CARTER
I won't help you subvert democracy.
LANDRY
This world is dangling by a thread, Colonel. And unlike you, the
rest of us will never have the luxury of leaving for someplace
better when things get tough. This is our home! And we'll make the
best of it.
[Landry walks into his office. Carter stares at Landry's retreating
figure in despair. She looks around the room, and Hammond pointedly
avoids her gaze.]
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Hammond enters Landry's office.]
LANDRY
I don't want to hear it, George.
HAMMOND
You could cut her a little slack, sir. She's completely out of her
element--trapped here away from everyone and everything she knows or
cares about.
LANDRY
She also happens to be a symbol of hope to the entire planet.
HAMMOND
Because we made her into one.
LANDRY
Because that's what we needed! See I know what you're thinking:
"damn politicians." I still can't stand 'em, and I'm one of them!
(his voice lowers)
The main one.
HAMMOND
You were the right man for the job. You still are. I know it wasn't
easy for you taking us down this road. What's going to be even
harder is getting us back.
[Landry looks at Hammond with a serious expression.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter, still wearing her overcoat, walks determinedly down the hall.
Charlie is standing in the hall discussing a file with someone. He
notices Carter walking by.]
CHARLIE
(to Carter)
Going somewhere? Maybe see your friend, Dr. McKay?
[Carter spins around to look at him. The aide leaves Charlie, who
approaches Carter.]
CARTER
You had me followed.
CHARLIE
He is a wealthy high-tech industrialist. And I'm sure if anyone
outside of this base had the resources to help you get back to your
universe, he'd be the one. But he also derives a significant portion
of his income from defense contracts, and some would argue he's a
likely target for an anti-trust investigation.
CARTER
(scoffing in disbelief)
You'd blackmail him to keep him from helping me.
CHARLIE
Just play your part, and everything will be fine.
[Charlie walks away.]
EXT--CITY STREET, DAY
[Carter walks up a side street in an obviously depressed area. Graffiti
covers one wall. She double checks a paper in her hand and hesitantly
enters one of the buildings.]
INT--MITCHELL'S APARTMENT
[Carter sits in the lone chair of the dilapidated apartment, looking
very ill at ease. She still keeps her overcoat on.]
MITCHELL
How d'ya take it?
CARTER
Uh, just black.
[Mitchell is restricted to a wheelchair. He has a cafeteria tray on his
lap where he has placed two cups of coffee. He wheels over and hands
her hers.]
CARTER
Thank you.
MITCHELL
Yeah, I like a little...sweetener in mine.
[Mitchell grabs a nearby whiskey bottle and pours a generous portion
into his cup. As he speaks, it is apparent his voice is more gravelly
than the Mitchell of Carter's universe. His hair is longer and unkempt,
and he wears grungy clothes.]
MITCHELL
I was an F-302 pilot. Got shot down over Antarctica.
CARTER
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
MITCHELL
(bitterly)
Well, a little late in the day for that, isn't it? I mean, I already
gave my legs for the freedoms we now enjoy. It's a helluva deal,
ain't it?
[Mitchell takes a large swig from his mug.]
MITCHELL
Of course I recognize you. Your picture's been in the papers a lot,
lately. Hey, you want to see something funny?
[He grabs a framed picture from a shelf and wheels over to hand it to
her. It is of him in his dress A uniform, standing on crutches next to
President Landry.]
MITCHELL
(continuing)
That's me. That's me when I was you. Hero of the moment. Poster
child for the administration.
CARTER
(surprised)
You were walking.
MITCHELL
Yeah, well, I had a little "setback" in my therapy.
(he lights a cigarette)
After Antarctica, they flew me to Washington. Pinned a medal on my
chest. Next thing I knew, I was being trotted out to state dinners,
political rallies. I think...yeah, I think I even opened a few
malls. Mr. President said: "it would be good for morale, son. Help
soften the blow for keeping the Stargate secret for so long"...
(under his breath)
What a load of b.s.
CARTER
So, what happened?
MITCHELL
(lost in memories)
I called them on it, and they dropped me... like a rock. No more
fancy dinners, no more "expensive doctors."
(rallying)
Anyway, walking's overrated. I got everything I need right here. And
I do not have to deal with curfews or military checkpoints or being
detained...without charge.
(turning to Carter)
Life is sweet.
CARTER
(rising)
Look, um, I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have come.
MITCHELL
Oh, no! No-no-no-no. You wanted to see for yourself, right? The
price for sticking up for your principles? Take a good look.
EXT--SIDE STREET OUTSIDE MITCHELL'S APARTMENT, DAY
[Carter exits the building. She looks around and spots a dark vehicle
with two men inside. She dials her cell phone.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Charlie's cell phone starts ringing as he works. He answers.]
CHARLIE
Yeah?
CARTER
(over phone)
It's me.
CHARLIE
Colonel? Where are you?
EXT--SIDE STREET, DAY
CARTER
(into phone, scoffing)
Please, you know exactly where I am. Look, I'll do it...
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
CARTER
(continuing, over phone)
...the interviews, the TV appearances...I'll play ball.
CHARLIE
Wise decision.
[Charlie hangs up the phone, smiling slightly.]
INT--"INSIDE ACCESS" NEWS STUDIO
[Donovan and Carter sit behind the anchor desk of the set. The
broadcast begins.]
DONOVAN
My guest tonight, Major Samantha Carter. A ten year veteran of the
Stargate program, and the woman who almost single-handedly saved the
world from the recent alien attack. Major, welcome.
CARTER
Thank you.
DONOVAN
Of course, I will be taking calls later in the segment, but first,
why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?
CARTER
Well, uh, as you said, I've been with the Stargate program for the
last ten years. Most recently, I was appointed as a special advisor
to the President.
DONOVAN
Great. In what capacity?
CARTER
My primary role is to consult with the President on matters of
planetary defense.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Charlie watches the television broadcast.]
CARTER
(on television)
But I also intend to push for improved foreign relations and the
restoration of civil liberties that were lost since the President
took office.
DONOVAN
(on television)
Really?
CHARLIE
(muttering to himself)
What the hell is she doing?
DONOVAN
(on television)
Does the President welcome this kind of input from his military
advisors?
CARTER
(on television)
Well, he wouldn't be much of a President if he wasn't...
[Charlie reaches for his phone.]
INT--"INSIDE ACCESS" STUDIO SET
CARTER
(continuing)
...at least willing to listen to other opinions. I mean while I
understand how we got to where we are today...
[Donovan is clearly uncomfortable.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
CHARLIE
(into phone)
Shut it down!
CARTER
(continuing on television)
...I think it's time to reassess the situation.
CHARLIE
(into phone)
I don't care if you're live, shut it down now!
INT--"INSIDE ACCESS" STUDIO SET
CARTER
The people of this country need to understand that they are in
control of their government, not the other way around.
(turning to face the camera directly)
It's your responsibility as citizens of this country to demand the
freedoms that have been taken away from you, demand accountability
for why they were withheld in the fir--
[Donovan reaches over and gently clasps Carter's arm to get her
attention.]
DONOVAN
Major, as much as admire what you're trying to do...they cut us off.
CARTER
Ah, thanks.
INT--MCKAY'S OFFICE
[Carter sits at McKay's desk using her laptop as McKay paces behind
her.]
MCKAY
What were you thinking? You can't say things like that!
CARTER
Well, somebody's got to say something, and I'm in a rare position to
make people listen.
MCKAY
They are not going to let you do that, all right? I know these
people, they do not mess around. What are you looking for, anyway?
CARTER
I want to see how my little tirade's playing out in the press.
MCKAY
It won't.
CARTER
What are you talking about? The show was live! Millions of people
were watching!
MCKAY
Doesn't matter.
CARTER
I don't understand this. There's nothing here. Wait a second...
(reading aloud)
"Major Samantha Carter had to cut short an appearance on 'Inside
Access' with Julia Donovan yesterday, when she suddenly took
ill....A spokesman said she was suffering from exhaustion due to her
busy schedule and would be cancelling her upcoming appearances."
MCKAY
That's what I'm telling you, Sam. Look, there is no story. It never
happened.
CARTER
(in disbelief)
You're wrong. People heard me.
MCKAY
Which people?
EXT--STREET OUTSIDE MCKAY'S OFFICE, DAY
[Carter heads to her car. As she reaches it, Charlie and two secret
service agents surround her.]
CHARLIE
Major Carter, you need to come with us.
[Carter fights off the two men in hand-to-hand combat, but is felled
when one fires a zat at her. Unconscious, they pull her into the
vehicle.]
CHARLIE
Get her in the car!
[They shove her in the vehicle and drive away with screeching tires.
The witnesses murmur, but no one has intervened.]
EXT--SPACE, EARTH ORBIT
[The Prometheus is in orbit above Earth, which is again visible.]
INT--LANDRY'S CABIN, PROMETHEUS
[Landry sits reading a classified report. The door opens, and Charlie
comes in, followed by two secret service agents manhandling Carter in.
She is conscious and walking, and has a gag around her mouth.]
LANDRY
A gag? Charlie, was that really necessary?
CHARLIE
It seemed appropriate, sir.
LANDRY
Get it off, and give us the room.
[The agents take off the gag and depart as Carter massages her jaw.]
LANDRY
What am I going to do with you, Colonel?
CARTER
You could let me go.
LANDRY
I still need you.
CARTER
For what? My knowledge of phase technology? Or as a prop for public
relations?
LANDRY
What if I said both?
CARTER
(shrugging)
I won't keep my mouth shut.
LANDRY
(rising)
But that's exactly what you do in your own world. The Stargate's
still a secret, right? I know you talk about "freedom" and
"democracy", but you're hiding the greatest secret mankind has ever
known from your own people!
CARTER
Well at least on my world, we don't intend to abandon the rest of
the galaxy to the Ori.
LANDRY
Well maybe not now. But what do you think will happen if you give
them a foolproof way to hide like you've given us? Don't be
surprised if the rest of the galaxy suddenly doesn't seem that
important anymore.
CARTER
Now, see I know at least one man who won't feel that way. He's the
leader of Stargate Command. His name is General Hank Landry.
LANDRY
Hmm.
[Landry chuckles and turns away.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB, SGC
[Carter enters the lab escorted by two secret service agents to find
McKay already there working at a computer.]
MCKAY
Ah, Colonel, how nice to see you again.
(to secret service agents, awkwardly)
Yes...well...thank you.
[McKay waves away the security escort. They leave.]
CARTER
McKay, what are you doing here?
MCKAY
Ah, it's the, uh, first day on the new job, your old job, actually:
"Special Advisor to the President." Bit of a paycut, but, uh, well
let's just say they were...uh...persuasive?
CARTER
(with deep regret)
I'm so sorry.
MCKAY
(wistful)
Yeah, me too.
(rallying)
Well, the first order of business is to create an inter-universal
bridge. Something that I've done in another reality, apparently.
CARTER
Are you serious?
MCKAY
Mmm. Yeah, I'm not sure what you said, but, uh, they're letting you
go.
CARTER
Wow. I guess they must've realized I'm more trouble than I'm worth.
MCKAY
Hmph. I remember I said the same thing the day we got divorced.
CARTER
(uncomfortable)
Ha ha.
[McKay reaches over for some cables and returns them to the table.]
MCKAY
The second order of business is to make this thing...
(points to Merlin's device)
...work like yours.
CARTER
Well, I'll leave you my notes. That should help. But let's say that
you succeed, then what?
MCKAY
Then we're safe.
CARTER
Huh. You do know that there is a whole galaxy out there that's under
attack, right? Millions of people are dying, millions more are being
subjugated to a false religion.
MCKAY
You just never quit, do you?
CARTER
Deep down, I know that your President's a good man.
MCKAY
(skeptically)
Hmm.
CARTER
He wants to do the right thing. Maybe he just needs a persistent
voice in his ear, nudging him in the right direction.
[She nudges him.]
MCKAY
And you think I would be good at...
(he nudges back)
...that, do you?
CARTER
(encouragingly)
The Rodney I know is a master of subtle persuasion.
MCKAY
Huh. Oh, you're lying again, aren't you?
CARTER
(smiling)
Just think about it.
[McKay sighs.]
END ALTERNATE UNIVERSE SCENES
INT--SGC ISOLATION LAB
[Lee paces the room with a sonic scanner attached to headphones around
his ears. While he stands facing one corner, a light brightens the room
and Carter and all her equipment appear.]
CARTER
Dr. Lee!
[Lee spins around and drops the device in shock. He instantly regrets
that because it makes the device squeal directly into his headphones.
He gasps and cries out in pain as he frantically tries to tear off the
headphones. Carter mouths the word "ow" in sympathy, then smiles as her
reality's Dr. Lee turns back to her looking relieved.]
LEE
You're back!
CARTER
(smiling)
Hi!
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Vala, Mitchell, Teal'c, and Carter are all gathered around her center
work table.]
CARTER
So you didn't get any news on Daniel while I was gone?
VALA
Mmm. Nothing.
MITCHELL
Well, at least we got you back.
CARTER
I am very glad to be back. The whole thing was kind of creepy.
VALA
Hmm. Hey, what was I like in that reality?
CARTER
(uncomfortably)
You were in jail.
VALA
Not again!
MITCHELL
(unsurprised)
Hmm. What about the rest of us?
CARTER
You know, to be honest, I'd really rather not talk about it.
(brightly)
What about you guys? What have you been doing this whole time?
[Her teammates exchange awkward looks. After a long pause...]
TEAL'C
When you did not return for several hours, we began to suspect that
something might have gone wrong.
VALA
Well we just assumed that the machine had malfunctioned, and you
were stuck out of phase.
TEAL'C
We attempted to communicate with you using the Sodan cloaking
device, and when that failed...
[Teal'c's voice trails off, and no one else speaks.]
CARTER
What?
VALA
We took shifts...trying to keep...you company.
CARTER
You mean...?
MITCHELL
Yeah, we talked to an empty room.
CARTER
For two weeks?
MITCHELL
It did stop eventually, but it did go on...for...quite some time.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
CARTER
(giddily)
Well, that must have been some conversation. What did you say?
MITCHELL
You know, I've got a file to read.
[He quickly exits. Carter turns expectantly to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
I have a sparring session with Sergeant Siler.
[Teal'c also departs. Carter turns to Vala.]
VALA
I'm bidding for a time share on E-bay.
[Vala leaves, but as she gets to the door, she runs back and hugs
Carter, who's taken off-guard.]
CARTER
Ooh!
VALA
Welcome back, Samantha. We really did miss you!
CARTER
(touched)
Thank you.
[Vala releases Carter and leaves.]
CARTER
(smiling)
It's good to be home.
