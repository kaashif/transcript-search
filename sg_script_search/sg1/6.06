Scenes from "Frozen"
FRAISER
(about O'Neill)
He's burning up.
From what I've been able to learn so far, sir, the virus ultimately
acts like cerebrospinal meningitis by attacking the brain.
THORAN
The symbiote, Kanan, is someone I know well. I have no doubt that he
would be willing to blend with O'Neill, cure him, and then leave him
again if another suitable host can be found.
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Sir, the symbiote's host died while they were on a mission. The
Tok'ra have strong reason to believe that the symbiote has vital
information to reveal and this would give him that chance.
Sir...please...
[O'Neill is in a rescue pod which is being carried by Carter, Thoran,
Teal'c, Jonas, and two medics. They carry him through the Stargate.]
END FLASHBACKS
EXT--UNKNOWN PLANET
[It is nighttime. Two people, a male and female, are running through
wooded area. They are being chased by Jaffa. A Stargate is seen in the
distance with light from campfires from around the Gate.]
WOMAN
It's too far.
[The woman stumbles and falls. The man returns to her and kneels beside
her.]
WOMAN
I can't...
MAN
(Tok'ra voice)
Hide here until the Chappa-ai is activated. Go!
[They both get up and move in different directions.The man continues on
to the Stargate, splashing through puddles and begins dialing the DHD.
A staff blast hits his right shoulder and he falls to the ground, face
down. He is struggling to get up, but is unable to do so. Seconds
later, a symbiote falls out of his mouth and scurries away. The man
continues to try and crawl away, but his hand is stepped on by a
Jaffa.]
JAFFA
Shek'mal, Tok'ra. Kree! Jaffa...Shal Kek.
[Another Jaffa rolls the man over to reveal that it is O'Neill, who
appears to be unconscious.]
FADE OUT
END TEASER--OPENING CREDITS
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS--SARCOPHAGUS
[The sarcophagus opens to reveal a slowly awakening O'Neill. A shadowed
face peers into the sarcophagus as O'Neill peers back.]
VOICE
(off camera)
The host lives, my lord.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[As alarm klaxons blare, a monitor indicates that a Tok'ra signal is
being received. Hammond descends the stairs from his office into the
control room. He walks up to Sergeant Davis, who is manning the
computer.]
SGT. DAVIS
It's the Tok'ra.
HAMMOND
It's about damn time.
[Hammond exits to the Gate room as Thoran walks through the Stargate.]
INT--GATEROOM
[Hammond approaches Thoran as he descends the ramp.]
HAMMOND
(to SFs)
Stand down.
THORAN
General Hammond.
HAMMOND
Councilor Thoran. I'm afraid my patience on this matter has just
about run out. You've been promising the safe return of Colonel
O'Neill for days. Where is he?
THORAN
I'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
CARTER
And he just walked out of your base. Nobody noticed he was gone
until it was too late.
THORAN
With the attack on Revanna, our numbers have been severely
diminished. We had no reason to expect this. I see no reason to
assign blame.
JONAS
Colonel O'Neill did put his life in your hands.
THORAN
Receiving a symbiote was his only hope for survival.
TEAL'C
He could have refused.
FRAISER
In which case you would have never been able to retrieve the
knowledge in Kanan's mind.
THORAN
A more than fair exchange.
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill would not agree to a blending with a symbiote unless
there was more at stake than his life.
THORAN
Perhaps it was that repugnance of blending with another mind that
caused O'Neill to behave so irrationally.
FRAISER
General, I can't speculate on Colonel O'Neill's state of mind, but
while a mature symbiote can take control of the host body whenever
it wants to, it doesn't work both ways.
CARTER
I can vouch for that, sir. There's no way Colonel O'Neill could have
walked out on his own.
TEAL'C
Then he was forced to do so, against his will, by the symbiote.
THORAN
You accuse an honored Tok'ra of behaving as a Goa'uld.
HAMMOND
Councilor...
THORAN
(cutting Hammond off angrily)
Kanan has fought the Goa'uld longer than any of you have lived. Yet
you spit the word symbiote as though you spoke of vermin. Whatever
you may think of our form, Kanan was as a brother to me. The Tok'ra
council accepts that Kanan may be lost to us.
HAMMOND
That's the big difference between us, Councilor. We don't leave our
people behind.
[Carter smiles.]
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS
[O'Neill is led into a room by two Jaffa who walk him onto a platform.
O'Neill is sucked forward into a metallic, spider-webbed panel in the
wall, with his back to the room. The Jaffa flank the door as Ba'al
enters and walks onto the platform. O'Neill is turned so that he is
facing into the room. The Jaffa leave.]
BA'AL
Who are you?
O'NEILL
You go first.
[Ba'al picks up a large knife from a table on the platform, looks at
its blade and takes a seat on a bench on the platform.]
BA'AL
You claim you do not know me?
O'NEILL
Well, take no offense there, Skippy, I'm sure you're a real hot,
important Goa'uld, I've just always been kind of out of the loop
with the snake thing.
BA'AL
I am Ba'al.
O'NEILL
That's it? Just Ball? As in Bocce?
BA'AL
Do you not know the pain you will suffer for this impudence?
[Ba'al walks to the front of the platform and holds up the knife which
becomes horizontal--as if magnetised--and aimed at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
I don't know the meaning of the word. Seriously. Impudence. What
does that mean?
[Ba'al lets go of the knife and it flies into O'Neill's left shoulder.
As O'Neill grunts in pain, Ba'al picks up another knife.]
BA'AL
I shall begin again. Who are you?
O'NEILL
Colonel Jack O'Neill, U.S. Air Force. Two L's in that.
BA'AL
That may be who you once were, Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
I may be a lotta things...but I'm no Tok'ra!
BA'AL
It is true we were only able to capture the host. Your symbiote fled
the body out of cowardice. But it is also true that Tok'ra share
body and mind equally. You will know all that it knew.
O'NEILL
I think I know less than you...think I know.
BA'AL
(raising another knife to horizontal)
Why have you come to this outpost?
O'NEILL
Now, see, that's a perfect example right there. I haven't a clue.
[Ba'al lets the knife go and it flies into O'Neill's left shoulder.
O'Neill yells in pain as Ba'al picks up another knife.]
BA'AL
You have been here before.
O'NEILL
First time.
BA'AL
You know your way to and from our most secret outpost. Clearly you
have been here.
O'NEILL
What?
BA'AL
Did you really hope to escape my personal guard?
O'NEILL
What?
BA'AL
Why did you abduct my slave?
O'NEILL
(in obvious pain)
All right...look! This is the last thing I remember, I swear to God.
I was sick. I agreed to let the Tok'ra put a snake in my head or I
would have died. Right now, I'm kinda wishing I had.
BA'AL
(smiling)
A wish easily granted.
(Looking at the third knife.)
What is your mission here?
O'NEILL
No mission.
BA'AL
Why have you returned?
O'NEILL
I've never been here.
BA'AL
What did you want with the female?
O'NEILL
(exasperated)
What female?
BA'AL
Death will only offer a temporary escape. I can revive you again and
again...a thousand times if need be. Only once you have told me
everything I ask, will you be allowed to die.
[Ba'al brings the third knife to horizontal position.]
BA'AL
One...last...time.
[He lets the third knife go and it flies towards O'Neill.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, Teal'c, Jonas and Thoran are studying the starmap.]
CARTER
Where was his last mission?
THORAN
As an operative aboard a mothership in Zipacna's fleet. He managed
to escape during a battle with Lord Yu's forces, but just barely.
JONAS
Did he have a motive to return to that vessel?
THORAN
Such as?
JONAS
Unfinished business? A task left undone?
THORAN
His report stated the mission objectives were complete. We are
willing to attempt contact with our operatives on these worlds here,
here and here.
[Thoran points to three spots on the starmap.]
TEAL'C
His previous missions.
THORAN
If Kanan returned to either of these worlds, for whatever reason,
our operatives may have learned of it.
JONAS
Well, when will we hear news?
THORAN
It may take many months.
TEAL'C
You spoke of Kanan's mission reports.
THORAN
What of it?
CARTER
Well, we'd like to see them. If Jonas' instinct is correct and Kanan
had unfinished business, there may be clues.
THORAN
Their contents are not relevant.
JONAS
Well, Colonel O'Neill's life is at stake. I believe that is
relevant.
THORAN
What you ask...is not possible.
CARTER
Really?
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS--SARCOPHAGUS
[The sarcophagus opens to reveal a slowly awakening O'Neill.]
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS
[O'Neill is led down a hall by two Jaffa. He is pushed into a room.
After one of the Jaffa moves his hand over a device on the outside wall
the room changes. O'Neill slips down as the floor suddenly becomes a
wall. The doorway has become the ceiling, many feet above. The room
contains two in-built benches and four lit panels which are in reach.
O'Neill hits the lit panels, but they appear strong and secure. A
distant scream is heard. He looks up towards the doorway in the
ceiling. A woman is sitting at the opening.]
WOMAN
Is it you?
[O'Neill simply looks up at the opening, a puzzled look on his face.]
DANIEL
Hi, Jack.
[O'Neill looks beside him to find Daniel, dressed in casual clothes, no
glasses, sitting on one of the built-in benches. He gives a little
wave.]
O'NEILL
Daniel...
DANIEL
I leave, and look at the mess you get yourself into.
[O'Neill gives him a quizzical look.]
DANIEL
It's good to see you.
O'NEILL
(cautiously)
Yeah, you too.
[O'Neill walks to the bench opposite Daniel and sits.]
O'NEILL
It's a shame you're a delusion.
DANIEL
No, I'm here. I'm...really here.
O'NEILL
(skeptically)
Sure you are
[O'Neill takes off his shoe and throws it at Daniel, who winces. The
shoe passes through him and bounces off the wall back towards O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Here in the sense that my consciousness is here, if not here in the
full physical flesh and blood sense, which is
really...neither...here nor there. The point is, you're not imaging
this.
O'NEILL
I just tossed my shoe through you.
DANIEL
Yes you did. That's because I've ascended to another plane of
existence.
O'NEILL
Ohhh.
DANIEL
Remember Oma Desala, the whole...glowing thing, you helped me out. I
couldn't have done that without you, remember that?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
DANIEL
I'm...I'm energy now.
O'NEILL
How's that workin' out for you?
DANIEL
Good, actually...very...
O'NEILL
Good.
DANIEL
Very good. You...however...
O'NEILL
Yeah, well...you know what it's like...
[O'Neill gets up and picks up his shoe.]
O'NEILL
...comin' back from the dead. Takes a while to get the color back in
your cheeks.
DANIEL
Yeah...
O'NEILL
(sitting down and again and pointing his shoe at Daniel)
So...not a delusion?
DANIEL
(shaking his head)
No.
O'NEILL
Okay...show me your stuff. Bust me outta here.
DANIEL
I can't.
O'NEILL
Why not?
DANIEL
I'm not allowed to interfere.
O'NEILL
You're interfering right now.
DANIEL
No, I'm not.
O'NEILL
Yes, you are.
DANIEL
No, I'm not. I am consoling a friend.
O'NEILL
What good's the power to make the wind blow or toss lightning around
if you can't use it to spring an old friend outta jail?
DANIEL
I would if I could.
O'NEILL
You can't do that stuff?
DANIEL
I can. I just...I can't.
O'NEILL
Well, thanks for stopping by, then.
DANIEL
Ba'al is torturing you and I wasn't just gonna sit by. Look, all he
wants to know is the reason you came to this planet. You really
don't know?
O'NEILL
Do you?
DANIEL
Well, all I know is that you...or more accurately, the symbiote the
Tok'ra placed inside of you...congratulations, by the way...walked
off undetected in the middle of the night and came here.
O'NEILL
I can't believe I actually let them put a snake in my head...my
head. I agreed to this.
DANIEL
It never shared with you why it would walk alone into a heavily
fortified Goa'uld outpost?
O'NEILL
There was no sharing! I was sick.
DANIEL
I know.
O'NEILL
They did the implantation, a word I intend never to use again, and I
woke up here. That's...my week, so far.
DANIEL
So you really don't know.
O'NEILL
(sighing, trying to remember)
Uhh...something to do with one of Ba'al's slaves. I got a visual but
I've never met her before.
DANIEL
Nobody knows you're here.
[O'Neill looks at him, stunned.]
DANIEL
Even if they did, they'd never be able to pull off a rescue because
this place is a fortress. Ba'al is just gonna keep on torturing you
to death and reviving you in a sarcophagus until...he finds out what
he wants, which is impossible because you don't know anything. Or
until you're not worth reviving any more. But you'll cease to be the
Jack O'Neill we know long before that.
O'NEILL
Well...apparently, I've got a big day tomorrow.
DANIEL
No, I'm not gonna let that happen. I won't let him destroy you.
O'NEILL
You just said you couldn't help.
DANIEL
No, I can't stop Ba'al from torturing you any more than Oma could
heal my radiation sickness, but...I can help you ascend.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond descends the stairs from his office to join SG-1 and Thoran.]
THORAN
Your underlings will not allow me to leave.
HAMMOND
My officers and enlisted personnel are following my direct orders.
THORAN
This Jaffa threatened my life.
TEAL'C
I merely informed you that any further attempt to activate the
Stargate would result in physical injury.
THORAN
Then I am a prisoner?
HAMMOND
I would prefer that you consider yourself a guest.
CARTER
And you'll be free to leave as soon as you provide us with the
mission reports we've requested, under article nine of our treaty.
THORAN
Such a request to the council must be made in person.
JONAS
Why's that? This control facility is quite capable of relaying a
request on multiple frequencies, including those used by the Tok'ra.
HAMMOND
Of course, if you choose not to avail yourself of that capability,
we would be pleased to provide you with comfortable quarters until
you decide to change your mind.
THORAN
You threaten the peaceful continuation of relations between our two
peoples, General Hammond.
HAMMOND
If our relations continue in the direction they're going,
Councilor...I don't give a damn.
[All of SG-1 smile politely at Thoran.]
THORAN
Very well, I will make your request that the reports be sent here
immediately.
HAMMOND
Thank you.
[Hammond leaves as Thoran glares at the team.]
INT--JACK'S CELL
O'NEILL
So...you wanna be my Oma?
DANIEL
You could put it that way, I mean, I wouldn't, but maybe that's just
me.
O'NEILL
And then what?
DANIEL
Then...then I don't know.
O'NEILL
You don't know.
DANIEL
No. No, ascension doesn't make you all-knowing. I mean, I
really...don't know.
O'NEILL
If I'm catchin' the next plane of existence outta here, you gotta
give me somethin'.
DANIEL
It's your journey. No one but you can choose what you become or the
path you take. All I can promise you is it will be an amazing
journey.
[O'Neill mutters in frustration]
DANIEL
Once you release your burden.
O'NEILL
Daniel, so help me, if you start talkin' like Oma...
DANIEL
I'm not talking like Oma Desala.
O'NEILL
Sounds like Oma to me.
DANIEL
No, no, no...see, Oma Desala would say something like...uh, uh, if
you know the candle is fire then the meal was cooked a long time ago
or something like that.
O'NEILL
Why?
DANIEL
To open your mind.
O'NEILL
Though a candle burns in my house...there's nobody home.
DANIEL
Okay. Let's take this one step at a time. This has to be something
you want. I can't do this for you.
O'NEILL
One step at a time.
DANIEL
One step at a time.
O'NEILL
Oh, there's gotta be another way outta here.
DANIEL
Jack...
O'NEILL
What if you did a little scoutin' for me? That'd be all right
wouldn't it?
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
I'm not askin' you to knock down walls or anything, just a little
recon.
DANIEL
Ba'al is just gonna torture you again.
O'NEILL
Or...uh, uh Zat gun...help me get my hands on a Zat gun.
DANIEL
The next time is gonna be worse.
O'NEILL
That's when we move, the next time they come for me.
DANIEL
You can't fight your way out of this.
O'NEILL
Then help me!
DANIEL
Not that way!
[The sound of a mechanism opening is heard and O'Neill and Daniel look
above to the entranceway]
DANIEL
They're coming.
O'NEILL
They can see you, right? We can use that.
DANIEL
I'll be back.
O'NEILL
A distraction. That's all I'm askin' for.
DANIEL
I promise.
[O'Neill looks up to see the Jaffa at the entrance. When he looks back
to where Daniel had been, he is no longer there.]
O'NEILL
Daniel?
[The Jaffa activate the device on the outer wall and the room changes
back to its original orientation, causing O'Neill to slam hard to the
new floor. The Jaffa walk in, pick him up off the floor and usher him
out of the cell.]
INT--SGC LAB
JONAS
His motive had to be personal.
TEAL'C
For what reason?
JONAS
Well, the Tok'ra claim that all of Kanan's spy missions were a
complete success, therefore, he'd have no reason to go back to any
of those planets. If we take them at their word, we can rule out any
logical reason. No, Kanan had to be motivated by
something...profound enough...t o not only risk his life but also
the life of his host.
[Carter and Teal'c contemplate Jonas' theory and return to studying
their computer monitors.]
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS
[A drop of liquid is squeezed from a spout on a bottle. The drop moves
horizontally into O'Neill's chest. O'Neill is once again pinned against
the spider web panel and he appears burned in several places on his
chest. He is in obvious distress.]
BA'AL
The Tal'vak acid will take some time to burn through all the way.
Though it cauterizes the flesh as it burns, a very small amount
often finds its way into the blood and begins to spread. Why have
you returned here, Tok'ra?
O'NEILL
I'm human.
BA'AL
Hmm...betrayed by your symbiote.
O'NEILL
It used me.
BA'AL
To do what?
O'NEILL
I don't know! And I don't care!
BA'AL
What did the symbiote call itself?
O'NEILL
(struggling to speak)
I don't remember.
BA'AL
Tok'ra retain the identities of both host and symbiote. You are
O'Neill. What was the name of your symbiote?
O'NEILL
(with more difficulty)
I...just told you.
BA'AL
What Tok'ra secrets could a single name reveal?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
BA'AL
Why protect the one who betrayed you...abandoned you to...this?
O'NEILL
(in obvious pain and with anger)
If I knew the name, I'd give you the damn name! I don't care about
protecting the Tok'ra!
BA'AL
(stepping forward and pointing the bottle at O'Neill again)
Tok'ra have been a nuisance for centuries.
O'NEILL
(weakly, pleading)
Don't.
BA'AL
Even when we thought they had been wiped out. They've become all the
more...insidious. Like...acid...burrowing holes into our empires.
O'NEILL
Kanan! That's the name.
[Ba'al lowers the hand holding the bottle]
O'NEILL
Kanan.
[Ba'al smirks at O'Neill and sets the bottle on the table. He picks up
another and walks toward the front of the platform.]
O'NEILL
(weakly)
I...I just told you.
BA'AL
(smiling)
Yes, you did.
[Ba'al squirts more liquid from the bottle which again hits O'Neill in
the chest. O'Neill flinches, but this liquid does not seem to be
causing him any further discomfort.]
BA'AL
This neutralizes the acid and numbs the pain. So you see, the truth
is rewarded.
O'NEILL
I don't know anything else. BA'AL
There may be much more of this Kanan still in your memory than even
you know. It'll come to you...in time.
[Ba'al pushes a device on the table where he has placed the bottles.
The web panel opens and O'Neill falls into a very long, black tunnel.]
INT--JACK'S CELL
[O'Neill falls onto the newly reoriented floor, face up, staring at the
Jaffa. The Jaffa walk away and O'Neill continues to lie there.
Suddenly, he sees the woman sitting at the entrance above his head.
O'Neill is rather dazed.]
WOMAN
Is it you?
O'NEILL
What?
WOMAN
You shouldn't have come back.
O'NEILL
I don't...remember.
WOMAN
If I leave with you, he will know.
O'NEILL
You...
[As O'Neill is lying there, Daniel appears, standing over him.]
DANIEL
Jack, who are you talking to?
O'NEILL
The woman.
[As Daniel looks up at the entranceway the woman's image
dematerializes.]
DANIEL
There's nobody there.
O'NEILL
Look who's talking.
DANIEL
Does it still hurt?
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
Told you I'd come back.
O'NEILL
If the Daniel Jackson I knew was really here...
DANIEL
I am.
O'NEILL
Then do something.
[Daniel squeezes his eyes shut and drops his head. O'Neill, regaining
some energy and cognizance, rolls himself up to stand facing Daniel.]
O'NEILL
You listen to me. I don't wanna go through that again. If you were
really my friend and had the power to stop it, you'd stop it!
DANIEL
The hardest part of being who or what I am is having the power to
change the things I want to change and knowing that I can't. Even
when I'm certain, even when it's...absolutely clear to me, even when
it affects the people I care about.
[O'Neill rolls his eyes and turns away from Daniel to lean against one
of the light panels.]
DANIEL
Because for all I can do, I'm no more qualified to play God than the
Goa'uld are. Ba'al will keep this up.
O'NEILL
Yes, he will.
DANIEL
So we don't have an unlimited amount of time.
O'NEILL
Gotta be some place, do ya?
DANIEL
No. Look, there must be a reason that Kanan came back here. Was it
for the woman? The one you were just talking to? She must have
something to do with all of this.
O'NEILL
(lacking enthusiasm):
You know...screw it...it doesn't matter. Carter and Teal'c'll think
of somethin'.
DANIEL
Even if they could find out where you are...
O'NEILL
(with more enthusiasm and turning toward Daniel)
And you know...Jonas...he's at least as smart as you.
DANIEL
There isn't always a way out, Jack.
O'NEILL
Hey, if that was true, I'd have been dead a long time ago!
DANIEL
How many more times do you think you can go into that sarcophagus
before it starts changing you?
[O'Neill shrugs.]
DANIEL
How many times has it been already? It can regenerate your body,
make you strong enough to go through that all over again, but all
the time, it's destroying who you are. And once that happens, you
won't be able to ascend no matter how much you want to.
O'NEILL
Hey...I appreciate what you're trying to do.
DANIEL
I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe you could do it.
O'NEILL
This is me we're talkin' about!
DANIEL
Yes, it is. Now, please...just try...to open you're mind.
O'NEILL
Oh...stop it, will you?
[O'Neill sits down in frustration.]
DANIEL
Come on, Jack. Y...You think the Asgard named uh, a ship after you
because they thought it was a cool name? Now's not the time to play
dumb, you're a lot smarter than that. They saw our potential in
you...because of who you are and what you've done. Humanity's
potential. That's the same thing Oma saw in me.
O'NEILL
I am not you.
DANIEL
Yeah, when has that ever stopped you from doing anything?
O'NEILL
Okay...put yourself in my shoes and me in yours.
DANIEL
You'd be here for me.
O'NEILL
Damn straight! I'd have busted you out, blown this rat hole to hell
and made sure that son-of-a-bitch suffered!
[O'Neill rises, frustrated at Daniel and wanting to get his point
across.]
DANIEL
The Others would have stopped you.
O'NEILL
They'd have a hell of a fight on their hands.
DANIEL
You wouldn't do that.
O'NEILL
Ba'al would be dead...
DANIEL
Jack...
O'NEILL
...And don't think I'd stop there!
DANIEL
You're a better man than that.
O'NEILL
(yelling)
That's where you're wrong!
[They stop and stare at each other. After several seconds, Daniel nods
his head slightly and turns away.]
DANIEL
Right now, I can't imagine doing or being anything other than what I
am. I see things, I understand things, in a way I never could have
before. But I chose this. Even when Jacob was trying to heal me, I
chose this. But you in the place you're at right now, you don't have
any other choices. This is not your life we're talking about, Jack!
This is your soul!
[O'Neill shakes his head slightly.]
DANIEL
This is it! What I'm offering you is your only way out.
O'NEILL
You're wrong about that too. I have another choice
[Daniel closes his eyes and shakes his head.]
DANIEL
What are you talking about?
[O'Neill simply looks at Daniel. Daniel shakes his head.]
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
Any minute, they're gonna come. Ba'al is gonna kill me again. You
can make it the last time.
DANIEL
Don't ask me to do that.
O'NEILL
You can put an end to it.
DANIEL
I won't do it.
[They both look up as they hear the mechanism.]
O'NEILL
I'd do it for you, and you know it.
[O'Neill walks over and lies with his feet a few inches from the wall
so that when it becomes the floor again, he won't fall.]
O'NEILL
I don't want to see this cell again, Daniel.
[The Jaffa reorient the room and enter to take a now solitary O'Neill
by the arms and usher him out of the cell.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Jonas and Teal'c are at the monitors, Carter is pacing with a notebook
in her hand.]
JONAS
I don't know about you two, but I'm beginning to get the feeling
that there's absolutely nothing here.
[Carter suddenly stops pacing.]
CARTER
Wait. Guys. Look at this.
[Carter walks back to her monitor and begins clicking the mouse to
bring up something to show the others.]
JONAS
What is it?
CARTER
The mission where Kanan worked undercover as a minor Goa'uld in
Ba'al's service. How long ago was that?
TEAL'C
Several months. Ba'al has kept the existence of the outpost hidden
from the other system lords.
JONAS
The outpost was a secret test facility for weapons technology and
gravity field generators. Over a period of several months he was
able to map out the entire facility, catalog it's defenses.
CARTER
That's what Kanan reported to the Tok'ra Council, but something just
struck me. He used Ba'al's Lotar, his personal slave, to access much
of that information.
JONAS
Yeah, the Lotar gave him access to Ba'al's chamber when he was away.
TEAL'C
Do you believe Kanan withheld information in his report?
CARTER
No. But think about it. A Lotar is a Goa'uld's most trusted servant.
TEAL'C
Why would he so blithely betray his master?
CARTER
Her master. The slave was a woman.
[Jonas look at her quizzically]
CARTER
Access to Ba'al's own chamber?
TEAL'C
Are you suggesting that Kanan engaged in an affair with this slave
in order to gain access to her master's quarters?
CARTER
Well, something had to be going on between them, otherwise, why
would she take the risk?
TEAL'C
A Tok'ra would go to great lengths to accomplish a mission.
CARTER
So, maybe he was just using her, but who knows, I mean the Tok'ra
are a very passionate race.
TEAL'C
The Tok'ra accept sacrifice as a function of war. I do not believe
this slave was a sufficient motive for Kanan to return.
JONAS
Sufficient motive for Kanan. The decision to act came after blending
with the mind of Colonel O'Neill.
CARTER
At which point, he would have been confronted with every thought and
belief that makes the Colonel who he is and be forced to judge
himself by that same code of honor.
JONAS
Especially what General Hammond referred to as the difference
between us and the Tok'ra.
[A look of realization comes over Teal'c and Carter.]
CARTER
We don't leave our people behind.
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS
[O'Neill is again attached to the web. The Lotar's face comes very
close to his, and they stare at each other.]
LOTAR
(formerly referred to as the Woman)
Is it you?
O'NEILL
You shouldn't be here.
LOTAR
You look so different. How can you be Kanan?
O'NEILL
I'm not.
LOTAR
If I leave with you, he will know.
O'NEILL
He used both of us.
[The Lotar vanishes.]
BA'AL
He did use both of us. How long were you host to this Kanan before
he convinced you to come here? Days, or merely hours?
O'NEILL
(very wearily)
I don't remember.
BA'AL
What did this Kanan share about his previous mission here?
O'NEILL
Nothing.
BA'AL
What did he want with my slave?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
BA'AL
Why did he return?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
[Ba'al rises from his bench to walk to the front of the platform.]
BA'AL
I believe you. You're a victim of this Tok'ra, just as I am. This
Kanan took over his host's body...your body...just as I or any other
Goa'uld would have done. He used you to come here. But to what
purpose? I believe the answers are there in your mind. Even if you
were host for a mere matter of hours, something of him will be left
behind. Huh...an unfortunate inheritance for you.
[He has walked to the table and opened a panel to reveal the bottles of
acid and the knives. He picks up a knife.]
BA'AL
Because, I will find them. If I have to...dig...them out.
[O'Neill closes his eyes and braces himself.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
HAMMOND
You're telling me Kanan was compelled to rescue a slave he
encountered months ago.
CARTER
As a direct result of blending with Colonel O'Neill, yes, Sir.
THORAN
Based on the arrogant notion the Colonel would never have left her
behind.
CARTER
Sir, I know from first-hand experience how deeply the emotions can
be shared between a Tok'ra symbiote and its host.
THORAN
So do I, Major Carter. Still you're theory seems to be based on
nothing more than intuition.
CARTER
I won't argue with that, but it's not without reasoning. I know
that's where Colonel O'Neill is.
TEAL'C
As do I.
JONAS
We're all in agreement.
THORAN
It makes no difference. If, indeed, Colonel O'Neill is in Ba'al's
hands, then he is far beyond our reach.
TEAL'C
We have plans to the outpost.
THORAN
Then you know it is a fortress. An army could not hope to penetrate
it.
CARTER
Kanan obviously thought it was possible.
(turns to Hammond)
Sir, if we went in with a small force, maybe two SG teams...
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, Major, but I agree with the Councilor. I've gone over the
intel we have on this outpost. A successful attack of any magnitude
is beyond our capabilities.
INT--BA'AL'S SARCOPHAGUS
[O'Neill is once again in the sarcophagus.]
INT--JACK'S CELL
[O'Neill is returned to his cell. He sits on the floor in readiness for
it to change into a wall. After the room changes orientation, he looks
up, wearily, then puts his forhead to the wall before slowly sliding
down the wall to sit with his back to the wall, cross-legged.]
INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
[Teal'c is meditating, surrounded by candles. Suddenly his eyes snap
open and he looks stunned.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is at his desk.There is a knock on the door.]
HAMMOND
Come in.
[Teal'c enters slowly.]
TEAL'C
General Hammond.
HAMMOND
Teal'c. What is it?
TEAL'C
I have been meditating on the possibility of rescuing Colonel
O'Neill.
HAMMOND
I've just been going over the plans to the outpost again, myself. I
just don't see how we'd have any chance of success against a
fortress this well defended, no matter how big the force.
TEAL'C
Agreed. I believe it would take the power of a Goa'uld mothership to
do so.
HAMMOND
Unfortunately, we don't have one of those.
TEAL'C
Perhaps not. But there are many system lords that do.
[Hammond looks at him, pensively.]
INT--BA'AL'S FORTRESS
[Ba'al is seated while O'Neill is being tortured again.]
BA'AL
What was its name?
O'NEILL
Kanan.
BA'AL
There...you remember his name. What was his mission?
O'NEILL
No mission.
[O'Neill is obviously greatly weakened.]
BA'AL
Was it to steal the slave from me?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
BA'AL
Did Kanan believe a slave could know my secrets? There's something
else you're hiding from me.
[He points a knife at O'Neill, but remains seated on the bench.]
BA'AL
I sense it. I feel it.
O'NEILL
(almost whispering)
When are you gonna end this?
BA'AL
If you tell me what I wish to know, I will end this.
O'NEILL
Daniel?
BA'AL
Your mind is beginning to fail. It's time for the sarcophagus, but
as you regain the strength to return here, consider
this...hmmph...it will be far worse next time.
O'NEILL
(very weakly)
Daniel?
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond joins SG-1 in the control room.]
HAMMOND
Councilor Thoran is threatening to end diplomatic relations.
CARTER
What did he say?
HAMMOND
Among other things I won't mention, that this is precisely the
reason they've been reluctant to share intelligence.
TEAL'C
So be it.
HAMMOND
That's more or less what I said. The Tok'ra need us right now, more
than we need them. Do we expect any response from Lord Yu?
CARTER
No, sir. We know he received the plans to Ba'al's outpost and the
message that went along with it, but we have no way of knowing if
he'll act on it.
TEAL'C
I believe he will. Ba'al has kept the existence of this outpost from
the other system lords.
JONAS
I still don't understand how destroying the power generators first
is going to help the Colonel.
TEAL'C
It will give O'Neill a fighting chance. Nothing more.
INT--JACK'S CELL
[O'Neill looks up.]
O'NEILL
(hopefully)
Daniel?
DANIEL
I'm here.
[O'Neill sighs and looks straight ahead as Daniel steps to his side.]
O'NEILL
You were gone.
DANIEL
I know, I'm sorry, there was something I had to do, but, I'm back
now and I promise I'll stay with you 'til this is over.
O'NEILL
It'll never be over.
DANIEL
Yes, it will.
O'NEILL
Daniel. You have to end this.
DANIEL
Jack, you just have to hang in there a little while longer.
O'NEILL
No. I can't go back in there. If I go back, I swear to God, I'll
give Ba'al what he wants, I'll tell him.
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
That he loved her.
DANIEL
Kanan?
O'NEILL
He came back for her. He wanted to save her.
DANIEL
Ba'al doesn't know this.
O'NEILL
If he finds out, he'll do to her what he's doing to me. Daniel, if
you don't end this...I'll tell him.
DANIEL
You won't have to. It's almost over, Jack.
[O'Neill turns to look at him for the first time.]
O'NEILL
How?
DANIEL
You were right. There's always a way out. Well, at least there's
always a chance. Your journey isn't over, Jack, not yet.
[O'Neill shows interest at Daniel's comment.]
O'NEILL
What'd you do?
DANIEL
I didn't do anything, it was, um, Sam and Teal'c, and, uh, Jonas,
too.
O'NEILL
What?
[Daniel smiles gently.]
DANIEL
They thought of something.
[O'Neill now seems more lively and jumps to his feet.]
O'NEILL
What?
[There is the sound of an explosion and the lights flicker in his cell.
Daniel stands up from his kneeling position and walks to where O'Neill
is standing, looking up.]
DANIEL
This is it. All you ever wanted was a fighting chance, Jack, now you
have it. If anyone can make it out of here, you can.
VOICE
(off camera)
Lord Yu attacks!
[The room starts to change orientation.]
O'NEILL
Daniel?!
[O'Neill looks down to discover that Daniel is no longer there. He
prepares himself for the room to change position as the wall becomes
the floor again. Hearing no reponse and seeing the lights flickering
around him, he decides to walk out of the cell. As he stands in the
opening, a Jaffa approaches. O'Neill ferociously attacks the Jaffa and
overpowers him. He grabs the Jaffa's Zat and as he makes his way
through the halls finds the Lotar in a cell. She backs away,
frightened, when she sees him approach.]
INT--LOTAR'S CELL
O'NEILL
(holding out his hand)
Come with me.
LOTAR
No. He'll stop us.
[O'Neill grabs her hand and they leave the cell]
O'NEILL
Come on.
[They leave the cell, running down the hallway and out of sight.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[O'Neill is lying on a bed in the infirmary, having just woken. As a
medical instrument is wheeled away, Carter, Teal'c and Jonas stand at
the foot of his bed.]
CARTER
Dr. Fraiser says he'll probably suffer withdrawal symptons from so
much time in a sarcophagus, but otherwise she expects a full
recovery.
JONAS
What happened to the woman he went back for?
CARTER
Her name's Shallan. She decided to stay with the Tok'ra.
TEAL'C
So she may continue Kanan's fight in his name.
O'NEILL
(weakly)
Hey. Tryin' to sleep here.
[Carter, Teal'c and Jonas turn to him, smiling gently.]
CARTER
Sorry, sir. Glad to see you're okay.
O'NEILL
Listen. Was a good idea you had there.
CARTER
Actually, sir, we all contributed to it. Do you need anything or...
O'NEILL
Water.
CARTER
Sure.
[Carter turns to leave and touches Teal'c's arm as she walks past him.
Teal'c and Jonas follow her out. As they leave, Daniel is seen standing
at O'Neill's bedside.]
DANIEL
I always seem to be saying goodbye to you.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I noticed that. Why don't you stick around for a while?
DANIEL
I can't, really.
O'NEILL
You just did.
DANIEL
Special occasion.
O'NEILL
Christmas?
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
Groundhog Day?
DANIEL
Nooo.
O'NEILL
I've got my journey, you've got yours?
DANIEL
Something like that, yeah. Look, I know you don't think so...right
now, I mean I know you have your doubts, but uh, because you've been
through something that no one should have to go through. I guess
what I'm trying to say is...you're gonna be all right.
O'NEILL
How do you know?
DANIEL
You're just gonna have to trust me.
O'NEILL
I can do that.
[Daniel smiles gently and nods.]
O'NEILL
You gonna be okay?
DANIEL
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
[The door opens and Carter walks in with the water. As she walks to the
bedside, Daniel is gone.]
CARTER
Here you go, sir.
O'NEILL
Thanks.
CARTER
Goodnight.
[Carter leaves, and O'Neill turns his head slightly to look upwards. He
smiles slightly.]
O'NEILL
Thanks.
