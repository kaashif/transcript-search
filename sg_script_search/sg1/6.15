EXT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE
[A barbecue is smoking. Someone picks up a hot dog. O'NEILL comes out
into the garden and sees there is a hot dog missing. He turns and sees
MAYBOURNE who is eating the hot dog.]
MAYBOURNE
I helped myself, I hope you don't mind?
O'NEILL
You're eating my dog.
MAYBOURNE
You want it back?
O'NEILL
Would you like a beer to wash it down?
MAYBOURNE
Already got one.
O'NEILL
What are you doing here?
MAYBOURNE
I can't drop by an old friend's house for a little barbecue?
O'NEILL
Well there's that little treason thing.
MAYBOURNE
Have me arrested. That's why I'm here.
O'NEILL
This is gonna be good isn't it?
MAYBOURNE
The current Administration is coming to the end of its second term.
I was hoping the President might consider one of those special
little pardons they often do when one doesn't care about re election
any more.
O'NEILL
Really good.
MAYBOURNE
I heard about what happened with Prometheus.
O'NEILL
I don't know what you're talking about.
MAYBOURNE
Oh, nice delivery.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I gotta work on that a little.
MAYBOURNE
Simmons used the Goa'uld in Adrian Conrad to hijack the X303. He
intended to fly them to a planet with a cache of advanced alien
weaponry. I was really broken up when I heard Simmons died, by the
way.
O'NEILL
Yeah, we all shed a tear.
MAYBOURNE
What you don't know is the planet Simmons was intending to fly to,
has a Stargate.
O'NEILL
Simmons knew?
MAYBOURNE
Sure. Ultimately it proved easier to grab the X303 than take hold of
the SGC just to use the Gate. The NID's known about this planet for
a while. I don't have to explain why they didn't tell you.
O'NEILL
So instead they're hoarding a secret that could save the planet.
MAYBOURNE
Oh, I'm sure they would have come clean if push came to shove. But
the address can be yours right now for what's behind door number
one.
O'NEILL
A Presidential pardon.
MAYBOURNE
This is the full prize package, Jack. I wanna go with you on this
one.
O'NEILL
You must have had a few before you came over.
MAYBOURNE
Look, I know you've questioned my methods in the past but we've
always been fighting for the same thing. I just want to help make
the world safe from the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Nice delivery.
MAYBOURNE
Well, thanks for the beer. Nothing I like more than a good wiener.
O'NEILL
Yes, you are what you eat.
MAYBOURNE
Guess I won't be needing this anymore.
[MAYBOURNE drops a piece of paper onto the barbecue.]
O'NEILL
What is it?
MAYBOURNE
The address to the planet with the Ancient weapons.
O'NEILL
For God's sake.
[O'NEILL snatches up the piece of paper and pours his beer on it to put
it out.]
MAYBOURNE
Won't do you much good without me.
O'NEILL
Why not?
MAYBOURNE
Simmons also didn't know that's there's an impenetrable doorway
protecting the weapons storage facility. And I have the key.
CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[O'NEILL, CARTER, TEAL'C and JONAS are sitting around the briefing
table.]
JONAS
Did he say how he came across this key?
O'NEILL
No.
HAMMOND
You were correct when you said it's doubtful the Pentagon would
authorise Colonel Maybourne's presence on an offworld mission.
TEAL'C
Should we not at least explore the planet to which he has provided
the address?
O'NEILL
He did risk his butt just to make the proposition.
CARTER
Maybe we can get through the door without him? If Maybourne thinks
it's worth a pardon, what's on the other side must be good.
HAMMOND
Do it.
EXT--PLANET
[A castle or monastery is in the distance on a mountain-top. A huge
moon fills the sky. SG-1 are walking through the ruins of the
monastery.]
JONAS
Nobody home.
[JONAS videos a wall hanging.]
TEAL'C
Are you able to translate any of this, Jonas Quinn?
JONAS
It's not Ancient but it's definitely a language belonging to one of
the races of the Ancient alliance.
O'NEILL
Nox? Asgard?
JONAS
Furlings.
O'NEILL
Oh no, not those guys.
JONAS
What?
O'NEILL
Oh I don't know, I just can't imagine cute little furry things
making big powerful weapons, that's all.
JONAS
I don't even know what they look like.
O'NEILL
Furling. Sounds cute and fuzzy to me.
JONAS
This section says something like "only the righteous may pass."
CARTER
This looks like where Maybourne's key would go. I'm getting energy
readings. There's a power source in this arch. Here.
[CARTER pulls a panel from the wall to reveal alien technology of some
sort.]
CARTER
Sir? This is definitely something.
O'NEILL
What?
CARTER
I don't know. I don't recognise the technology.
O'NEILL
But can you make it work?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[O'NEILL comes through the Gate.]
O'NEILL
Well General, Maybourne's story checks out so far. There's a doorway
there that Carter thinks might be a transporter but she can't get it
to work without Maybourne's key.
HAMMOND
What do you recommend Colonel?
INT--SGC ELEVATOR
[MAYBOURNE exits the elevator, handcuffed.]
MAYBOURNE
Jack.
O'NEILL
Harry.
MAYBOURNE
I'm trusting you.
O'NEILL
You turned yourself in. What happens from hereon out is up to you.
[O'NEILL and MAYBOURNE walk into the briefing room.]
HAMMOND
You can remove the cuffs, Airman.
MAYBOURNE
General, nice to see you again.
HAMMOND
Despite your prior transgressions, you've shown a willingness to
help us out of some serious situations recently. And that is why the
President is willing to proceed in this matter.
MAYBOURNE
You're welcome.
O'NEILL
Let's see what you brought.
[MAYBOURNE opens a carrying case and takes out a cloth-wrapped parcel.
He unwraps it and reveals an artifact. O'NEILL picks it up.]
MAYBOURNE
When do we leave?
O'NEILL
I leave right now. We'll let you know how it turns out.
MAYBOURNE
Jack. I thought I was pretty clear. I go with you or no deal.
O'NEILL
Harry, you're under arrest, I've got the stone and I'm walking out
that door. You're not in a strong bargaining position.
MAYBOURNE
The only way this mission will be successful is if I'm on it. That
stone is useless without the combination.
O'NEILL
How's that?
MAYBOURNE
It was originally found over eighty years ago in a Pharaoh's tomb in
Egypt. The stone was wrapped in a scroll with writing on it that no
Earth linguist could decipher. I was recently able to get it
translated though.
O'NEILL
By whom?
MAYBOURNE
The scroll contained instructions for how to use the stone to access
the power of the Gods. That information exists in one place. Right
here. A deal's a deal. You want to go through the door? I'm gonna be
the one who opens it.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
HAMMOND
There's got to be something more going on here than he'll admit to.
O'NEILL
Of that I have no doubt, Sir. But if he's not willing to tell us, we
can't force him. Much as I'd like to try.
[MAYBOURNE enters.]
MAYBOURNE
Now this is more like it.
O'NEILL
Shall we?
[O'NEILL and MAYBOURNE walk up the ramp. MAYBOURNE stops at the top of
the ramp.]
O'NEILL
Yes?
MAYBOURNE
You know the real reason I wanna do this? I've never actually been
through this thing before.
O'NEILL
Really?
MAYBOURNE
I ran the off world operation from Earth using a Goa'uld
communicator.
O'NEILL
Nervous?
MAYBOURNE
Me? No. I'm just taking a moment.
O'NEILL
Done?
MAYBOURNE
Yeah.
[O'NEILL and MAYBOURNE walk through the Gate.]
EXT--PLANET
[Same view as previously, but the moon is not out. O'NEILL and
MAYBOURNE walk into the ruins.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
CARTER
Colonels.
MAYBOURNE
Major.
O'NEILL
Jonas?
CARTER
He finished cataloguing the writing and went to do a wider sweep of
the surrounding area with Teal'c.
MAYBOURNE
He translated everything?
CARTER
No. He still needs to get some reference from the SGC. Says it'll
take a while.
O'NEILL
Harry?
[O'NEILL gestures towards the arch. MAYBOURNE goes over and puts the
key into a slot in the arch and turns it. Lights appear but nothing
happens.]
O'NEILL
What?
MAYBOURNE
I'm sure I've got it right.
O'NEILL
Harry?
MAYBOURNE
It should have worked.
[CARTER goes over to MAYBOURNE.]
CARTER
Let me take a look.
[MAYBOURNE grabs her Zat and shoots her in the back. CARTER collapses
and he shoots at O'NEILL. MAYBOURNE pulls the key off the wall and the
doorway opens. O'NEILL gets up groggily.]
O'NEILL
Harry!
[O'NEILL grabs MAYBOURNE as he goes through the doorway. They both fall
through and the doorway closes.]
EXT--A FIELD, LOCATION UNKNOWN
[O'NEILL falls on top of MAYBOURNE. He grabs him.]
O'NEILL
You rotten, no good for nothing...
MAYBOURNE
Jack?
O'NEILL
You son of a...
MAYBOURNE
Jack!
[O'NEILL looks up and sees that they are in a field that seems to be
nowhere near their previous location.]
EXT--PLANET--RUINED MONASTERY
[JONAS and TEAL'C arrive and find CARTER zatted.]
JONAS
Major Carter? What happened?
EXT--PLANET
O'NEILL
Where the hell are we?
MAYBOURNE
Dammit, Jack, why'd you have to do that?
O'NEILL
Where's the Zat?
MAYBOURNE
I don't know, I don't have it.
[O'NEILL raises his P-90.]
O'NEILL
Where is it?
MAYBOURNE
It's not here. I guess it didn't come through with us.
O'NEILL
Why not?
MAYBOURNE
Well, how should I know? Maybe the doorway filters out weapons?
[O'NEILL lifts the P-90.]
MAYBOURNE
Goa'uld weapons?
O'NEILL
Right, you listen to me. I want a straight answer from you.
MAYBOURNE
Well since you're here, I might as well just show you.
[MAYBOURNE walks away.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
MAYBOURNE
Come on!
[O'NEILL follows MAYBOURNE.]
EXT--MONASTERY RUINS
CARTER
I'm getting nowhere here. Jonas, head back to the SGC, ask General
Hammond to send up a UAV. If Colonel O'Neill has activated his
tracking device, we should be able to pinpoint his location.
EXT--PLANET
MAYBOURNE
You couldn't just let me go.
O'NEILL
You shot me!
MAYBOURNE
Zatted. I'm not going back, you know.
O'NEILL
Where?
MAYBOURNE
Anywhere. To the Stargate or Earth.
O'NEILL
What are you talking about?
MAYBOURNE
I don't know, maybe they've got a way to send you back. I don't
think anyone's supposed to leave, that's part of the deal.
O'NEILL
Who are you talking about? What deal?
MAYBOURNE
The people at the place we're going.
O'NEILL
Maybourne, have you completely lost your mind because if you're
suffering I'll gladly put you out of your misery.
MAYBOURNE
It's an alien Utopia. According to the scroll it's supposed to be
paradise.
O'NEILL
What?
MAYBOURNE
A long time ago, some people from an advanced alien society, well
they chucked it all and they formed this small, isolated Utopian
community. They sent out representatives to meet and evaluate people
from all over the galaxy and offer them a chance to join them. The
scroll and the stone were the invitation.
O'NEILL
And this has nothing to do with the weapons Simmons was after?
MAYBOURNE
I just figured it was my only way of getting through the Gate.
O'NEILL
You know, Harry, it's not that I can't believe you lied to me again,
it's that you lied to me again!
MAYBOURNE
Oh come on, Jack, no one would have let me through the Gate for
this. Would you have even believed me?
O'NEILL
And you're sure this is all worth it?
MAYBOURNE
Couldn't be much worse than where I've been forced to hide out
lately. They're closing in on me. It's only a matter of time.
Besides, I've got nothing left on Earth anymore. The money I was
supposed to get from selling the Russian symbiote to Adrian Conrad
was my last shot at making a life on Earth. Do something good and it
turned into a disaster.
O'NEILL
Of massive proportion.
MAYBOURNE
I'm tired of running, Jack. Why should I, when I could have a chance
of retiring in paradise?
O'NEILL
I see trees, Harry. You get that in Colorado.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[SILER is preparing a UAV.]
SILER
Ready for launch, Sir.
HAMMOND
Thank you, Sergeant.
[CARTER and TEAL'C come through the wormhole.]
CARTER
Still nothing from Colonel O'Neill and Colonel Maybourne, Sir.
They've been gone over two hours now.
HAMMOND
We're ready to go.
CARTER
Sir, I'd like to apologise.
HAMMOND
What for?
CARTER
This is my fault. I allowed Colonel Maybourne to take my weapon.
HAMMOND
Major, let's just focus on finding them right now.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--PLANET
O'NEILL
You are so lost.
MAYBOURNE
No, I'm sure this is the right way.
O'NEILL
How's that?
MAYBOURNE
It's in this valley. What's strange is, there's supposed to be a
greeting party.
O'NEILL
And you know, that's all that's strange about this.
MAYBOURNE
They're supposed to know when someone uses the doorway. I was
expecting some sort of welcome.
O'NEILL
Mai-tais? Leis?
MAYBOURNE
Well, something.
O'NEILL
Cabana boys? I tell you Maybourne, I don't hear any steel drums. How
old was that invitation?
[O'NEILL and MAYBOURNE enter what appears to be a deserted village.]
MAYBOURNE
There's no one here.
O'NEILL
I noticed that.
[O'NEILL picks up a circular object. He puts it down and walks to the
edge of the village.]
O'NEILL
Harry?
[MAYBOURNE goes over to O'NEILL. Looking down, there are a number of
skeletons lying on the ground.]
O'NEILL
This in the brochure?
EXT--THE RUINED MONASTERY
LEE
Major, this technology's unlike anything we've come across before.
CARTER
I know.
LEE
We have no frame of reference, no way to interface.
CARTER
I'm working on it, Doctor. As you should be.
LEE
Right.
[TEAL'C is in Kel'no'reem in the background. Hearing this exchange, he
opens his eyes.]
EXT--PLANET
[O'NEILL and MAYBOURNE are sitting by a lake.]
O'NEILL
I guess I can see why you'd want to retire here. Given your choices.
MAYBOURNE
Find anything that might be a doorway back?
O'NEILL
No.
MAYBOURNE
You gonna kill me?
O'NEILL
I'll sleep on it.
[The sun sets. As it rises the next morning, O'NEILL is filling up his
canteen in a river. He walks back to the village through a field, a
forest, and past a waterfall. Back at their camp, MAYBOURNE is breaking
up wood.]
O'NEILL
Well I don't think we're walking out of here.
MAYBOURNE
No way of knowing how far we were transported. We could be on the
other side of the planet.
O'NEILL
Which is why we survive here until we're rescued.
MAYBOURNE
Until we're rescued. Jack, this place is supposed to be a secret.
The doorway was designed to keep it that way.
O'NEILL
Of course, we have the only key known to man.
MAYBOURNE
The least you could have done was eat that before you got here.
[O'NEILL is eating an energy bar. He then throws half to MAYBOURNE.]
O'NEILL
We're gonna need food and drinkable water.
MAYBOURNE
I've been drinking the lake straight up.
O'NEILL
Well that's smart.
MAYBOURNE
I'm not dead yet.
O'NEILL
It's early.
MAYBOURNE
Jack, they're never gonna find us.
EXT--THE RUINED MONASTERY
[The scientists are packing their gear as CARTER enters.]
CARTER
I covered as much territory as the range of the UAV will allow.
TEAL'C
Have you received word from the Tok'ra?
CARTER
Yeah, they responded and said they didn't know when one of their
operatives with access to a ship would be able to help us.
(She notices that the scientists are packing.)
What are they doing?
TEAL'C
I believe they have completed their analyses.
CARTER
Excuse me? Where's Colonel O'Neill? I don't see him, do you? Did you
guys find him while I was gone?
LEE
We've been here for a week and I'm not sure, but I'm pretty certain
that we could all spend the rest of our natural lives trying to
figure out exactly how this thing works. Do you know what? Even if I
could snap my fingers and turn it on right now, I'm beginning to
doubt whether it would determine where it sent Colonel O'Neill. I'd
bet almost anything that the targeting data is in the artefact that
Colonel Maybourne used to open that doorway.
CARTER
I say when we're done here.
LEE
With all due respect Major, I will submit my report to General
Hammond. If he's prepared to commit to a long term analysis project,
I'm happy to come back, with my big suitcase. But until then, if
you'll excuse me?
EXT--PLANET
[O'NEILL is fishing.]
MAYBOURNE
Anything?
O'NEILL
Couple of nibbles. They're down there, though.
MAYBOURNE
Sleep okay?
O'NEILL
No. You?
MAYBOURNE
When we first came here, I thought it was quiet. Now it's like I
can't keep the noise out. Insects, animals, I don't know, I keep
hearing things.
O'NEILL
They're called birds.
MAYBOURNE
No, no, no, these are weird sounds.
O'NEILL
We're on an alien planet.
MAYBOURNE
Yeah. Jack I can't live on this stuff, it tastes like arrugula. I
hate arrugula.
O'NEILL
Don't eat it.
MAYBOURNE
We have to eat.
O'NEILL
You know, if you keep standing there yakking away, I'm not gonna
catch anything.
[MAYBOURNE throws something into the lake.]
O'NEILL
What was that?
[MAYBOURNE presses a button on a device he is holding. There is an
explosion in the lake. He shrugs and wades into the lake]
O'NEILL
That is just wrong on so many levels.
[From the middle of the lake, MAYBOURNE throws a fish towards O'NEILL,
almost hitting him.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S AND MAYBOURNE'S CAMP
O'NEILL
Don't ever do that again.
MAYBOURNE
You're saying you don't hear things?
O'NEILL
No.
MAYBOURNE
Last night, I swear I heard someone running around out here. Spent
an hour wandering around trying to spot him.
O'NEILL
Animals.
MAYBOURNE
No tracks.
O'NEILL
You're losing your mind.
MAYBOURNE
You don't find things a little spooky around here?
O'NEILL
Made so only by your presence.
MAYBOURNE
yeah well, I'm beginning to wonder if some of the Utopians might
still be alive.
O'NEILL
There's no evidence of that.
MAYBOURNE
Well maybe they're here in another way.
O'NEILL
All right, now you are getting spooky.
MAYBOURNE
Oh, come on, Jack, you've seen stranger things. Other dimensions,
planes of existence. You said it your self, this is an alien planet.
O'NEILL
So what do you want me to do?
MAYBOURNE
Give me your nine mil.
O'NEILL
No.
MAYBOURNE
Oh come on, you've got the P-90. You sleep with it beside you for
God's sake; I just want to be able to protect myself.
O'NEILL
Forget it.
MAYBOURNE
Jack! I want that gun.
O'NEILL
Forget it! You don't like it here, deal with it. It's your own damn
fault.
MAYBOURNE
You wouldn't care if I died would you?
O'NEILL
What are you talking about?
MAYBOURNE
Some alien creature comes in and attacks me in the middle of the
night, hauls me out while you're sleeping.
O'NEILL
You and I are the only ones here. Trust me, the only thing you have
to be afraid of around here is me.
MAYBOURNE
Yeah.
[MAYBOURNE takes his fish to his tent. Later, O'NEILL leaves his tented
area and hides his ammunition in the brush. Meanwhile, someone is
watching him.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[CARTER, TEAL'C, JONAS and HAMMOND are in the Briefing Room.]
CARTER
Sir, a satellite capable of pinpointing Colonel O'Neill's tracking
device would be able to cover a much greater range. The Tok'ra could
retrieve it later by ship when one became available so the actual
cost would be minimal.
HAMMOND
Compared to what?
CARTER
To not getting the satellite back.
HAMMOND
What about the cost of the delivery system, never mind the manpower
required to get it through the Gate and then reassemble it on the
other side?
CARTER
Sir, I don't think you can place a value on Colonel O'Neill's life.
HAMMOND
Of course not, but...
DAVIS
(Over PA system)
Unscheduled offworld activation.
HAMMOND
We'll continue this later.
[They go down to the Control Room.]
DAVIS
We're receiving a transmission, audio only.
JOLEN
(Voice over PA system)
This is Jolen of the Tok'ra. To whom am I speaking?
HAMMOND
General Hammond. Major Carter, Teal'c and Jonas Quinn are also here.
JOLEN
Major I just received your message regarding the disappearance of
Colonel O'Neill.
CARTER
Do you have a ship capable of scanning the planet?
JOLEN
Yes. In fact I've already taken the opportunity to fly over the
planet in question. There were no detectable human life signs.
CARTER
Are you sure?
JOLEN
Quite sure. I am very sorry.
HAMMOND
Thank you. Hammond out.
JOLEN
Jolen out.
[The Gate shuts down.]
EXT--PLANET
[O'NEILL wakes up and discovers that his P-90 is gone. He picks up his
9mm and walks outside. Checking on Maybourne's sleeping area, he finds
him gone. He then discovers that his cache of ammunition has been
stolen. He checks around the camp and sees the round artifact on the
table. While chewing some leaves from a local plant, he sits down and
opens up the artifact, which seems to be a book or record, containing a
map of the area. He makes charcoal by burning some bark and starts
marking the positions of the skeletons around the village on the map.
As O'NEILL is leaning on the table, looking at the map, he hears a
noise. He starts to run rather frantically around the camp holding his
gun.]
O'NEILL
Maybourne!
[O'NEILL wades through the river and finds another village. There are
more skeletons. One has a knife in its neck. O'NEILL pulls out the
knife and a skeleton of a Goa'uld.]
INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM
[CARTER is sitting on a bench, clearly distressed. TEAL'C enters.]
TEAL'C
Major Carter.
CARTER
Teal'c, this is the women's locker room.
TEAL'C
It appears there is no one else here but you and you are fully
clothed.
CARTER
True.
[TEAL'C sits down next to CARTER.]
TEAL'C
Are you all right Major Carter?
CARTER
I'm fine, yeah.
TEAL'C
Have you given up hope of finding O'Neill?
CARTER
Hope? No. I'm starting to think Dr Lee is right. I don't think the
doorway is the answer. It's been almost a month Teal'c, if there
were a way back. It just, it feels like we just lost Daniel, and I
don't know if I can...
[CARTER cries. TEAL'C hugs her.]
EXT--PLANET
[O'NEILL is walking through the forest and trips a wire. He hears
something click and dives for cover as a grenade explodes, throwing him
into the undergrowth. A boar with a spiked collar charges at him. He
fires two shots at it. MAYBOURNE yells in pain. O'NEILL gets up and
sees MAYBOURNE hiding in the undergrowth. He is bleeding from a gunshot
wound.]
MAYBOURNE
You shot me!
O'NEILL
I didn't know you were there.
MAYBOURNE
Stay back!
[MAYBOURNE aims the P-90 at O'NEILL.]
O'NEILL
Put that down.
MAYBOURNE
(Getting up)
You wanted to kill me from the start.
O'NEILL
Oh screw you Maybourne! I was joking. Look what you did to my leg!
MAYBOURNE
I set the trap for the pig.
O'NEILL
With a grenade?
[MAYBOURNE backs off and staggers into the forest.]
O'NEILL
Where are you going? Harry? I found something. Stop eating that
plant. It's messing with your head, Harry. Ah, screw you.
EXT--PLANET
[At their camp, O'NEILL is pulling a large splinter from a wound in his
leg.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB AT THE SGC
[CARTER and TEAL'C are looking at a computer screen as JONAS enters.]
JONAS
General Hammond says he's considering new SG-1 leaders. You included
Major.
CARTER
We know. Do you have anything?
JONAS
Yeah, yeah, I was finally able to come up with some photos of that
artifact Maybourne had his hands on. It's quite old, making the
scroll a bit difficult to read and I'm pretty sure that the markings
on the stone are just decoration but...
CARTER
Teal'c, wind back that tape. Stop, there.
JONAS
That was the first day we were there.
CARTER
I don't believe it. It wasn't visible after that. I forgot it was
even there.
JONAS
What?
CARTER
The moon. The doorway device doesn't use wormhole technology, it
wasn't designed to send you across the galaxy. We thought they'd
been sent somewhere else on the planet but they haven't, they've
been sent to that moon.
JONAS
How do you know that?
CARTER
(Indicating the key device)
The big circle is the planet, the little circle is the moon, the
line between them is the path of transportation.
EXT--THE CAMP
[O'NEILL is resting when he hears a noise. He gets up. At the other
side of the camp, MAYBOURNE is hiding, his face covered in camouflage
paint.]
O'NEILL
Harry? Harry? It was a Goa'uld. It couldn't bring a weapon through
that door so it brought a plant. It's some kind of drug or
something. Maybe it was an experiment, maybe it was supposed to get
the people to serve him, I don't know but it backfired. These
people, they all killed each other because of that plant. You're
paranoid, it's messing with your head. I'm not trying to kill you.
[MAYBOURNE shoots at O'NEILL, then throws a grenade. He runs towards
where O'NEILL is. He stops when he hears O'NEILL cock his gun behind
him.]
O'NEILL
Drop it. Drop it now or I will shoot you.
[MAYBOURNE raises the P-90 to fire. O'NEILL shoots him.]
O'NEILL
I'm not trying to kill you, Harry. You're losing a lot of blood. If
I don't do something right now, you're gonna die.
EXT--CAMP
[O'NEILL is sitting by the fire as MAYBOURNE starts to come round.]
MAYBOURNE
Some retirement this turned out to be.
O'NEILL
How are you doing?
MAYBOURNE
My head's a little clearer. How long have I been out?
O'NEILL
I don't know, day or so.
MAYBOURNE
I really screwed up didn't I?
O'NEILL
It's not your fault. None of the people here could stop themselves.
MAYBOURNE
Right from the beginning. Sorry, Jack, I never should have dragged
you into this.
O'NEILL
Yes, Harry, you've been a very bad boy.
[MAYBOURNE is straining to breathe.]
O'NEILL
Hey, don't you die on me now.
MAYBOURNE
What difference would it make?
[A Tok'ra ship appears and flies over the camp.]
O'NEILL
Because we're about to be rescued.
MAYBOURNE
Oh that's nice.
O'NEILL
Isn't it?
MAYBOURNE
I can't go back. I'd rather die here than spend the rest of my life
in jail.
O'NEILL
Yeah, um, I've been giving that some thought. I think you've
suffered enough. Hell I even got to shoot you.
MAYBOURNE
Twice.
O'NEILL
I think the Tok'ra should be able to find a nice planet for you.
MAYBOURNE
Thanks, Jack.
O'NEILL
Sure, Harry, sure.
