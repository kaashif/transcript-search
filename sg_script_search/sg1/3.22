TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is in an infirmary bed. O'Neill walks in wearing civilian
clothing.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
DANIEL
Hey!
O'NEILL
How are you doing?
DANIEL
Good...did you get your hair cut?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Why?
DANIEL
No reason.
O'NEILL
Can I see your scar?
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
Fraiser says it'll be about a week before you get out of here.
DANIEL
You know it's funny. I mean after everything we've been through
these past few years. And, of all things, it's my appendix that lays
me out...
[O'Neill looks at Daniel.]
DANIEL
...But it's not going to be a week. I mean I practically feel fine
now.
O'NEILL
Want to go fishing?
[Daniel raises slightly from the bed but is in obvious pain.]
DANIEL
Actually I wouldn't...well, maybe...No, you know, I think maybe I
will stay here for two or three...three days.
O'NEILL
Bye.
[O'Neill walks out of the infirmary, leaving Daniel to recuperate.]
INT--SCIENCE LABS
[Carter is welding what looks like a naquadah reactor as O'Neill walks
in.]
O'NEILL
Carter!
[Carter puts the welder down.]
CARTER
Sir, hi! How's Daniel?
O'NEILL
Oh. He's going to be fine. What are you doing?
CARTER
Umm, I'm getting ready to do a detailed analysis of the decay rate
of naquadah within the reactor. It's really quite amazing that
unlike plutonium, naquadah actually has a...
O'NEILL
Aaaaghhh! I'm on vacation!
CARTER
Yes sir.
O'NEILL
So are you.
CARTER
I know...It's not that I'm happy that Daniel's in excruciating pain
or anything like that but I've actually been looking forward to an
opportunity like this for quite some time.
[O'Neill screws face up.]
O'NEILL
You know. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that when one actually
got some leave, one actually left! Look, Daniel's recouping, Teal'c
is off world visiting his kid somewhere. Personally I have a date
with a little lake in Minnesota where the bass grow
(opens arms wide)
that big.
CARTER
(sarcastically)
Really.
O'NEILL
Oh yes! What I am describing here, Carter involves a very special
element.
[Carter gestures at equipment.]
CARTER
This is fun to me, sir.
O'NEILL
Well, if playing with your little reactor sounds better than
exploring the lakes and natural beauty of northern Minnesota,
there's not much I can do.
CARTER
Was that an invitation...sir?
O'NEILL
Nothing wrong with that is there? A couple of coworkers, friends if
you will, fishing. It'd be fun.
CARTER
Wow. I appreciate the offer, sir. Really. Sounds great...but I
should...
O'NEILL
No sweat. See you in a week, and by all means, have fun.
[O'Neill walks out.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill is humming and heading out of the base as Carter jogs after
him.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[O'Neill stops and turns around.]
CARTER
Um, have a good time!
O'NEILL
Land of sky blue waters? Loofahs. "Ya sure you betcha, snookums."
Mosquitoes...
[A bright light surrounds O'Neill and he disappears. Carter runs and
hits the alarm.]
INT--BELISKNER
[O'Neill materializes inside the ship...]
O'NEILL
...Home of the loons...
[He looks at Earth far below through a portal.]
O'NEILL
Thor? Helloooo?
[O'Neill walks down a corridor and hears a strange mechanical sound.
Suddenly a mass of what looks like mechanical bugs approach him.]
O'NEILL
What the hell? Damn!
[He backs against the wall as the bugs get closer.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--BELISKNER
[O'Neill is backed up against a wall. The mechanical bugs are still
approaching. One crawls up the wall behind him and onto his chest.]
O'NEILL
(panicked)
Aaghhh! Get off!
[He throws the bug off himself. The rest of the bugs continue on down
the corridor.]
O'NEILL
What the hell?
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter and Hammond exit the elevator and head for Hammond's office.]
CARTER
I'm pretty sure it was the Asgard transportation technology.
HAMMOND
For Jack's sake, let's hope you're right.
CARTER
It depends on what they want this time, sir.
HAMMOND
True. Send a message through the Stargate to Teal'c.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[General Hammond picks up the phone in his office.]
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond. Get me Major Davis at the Pentagon.
INT--BELISKNER
O'NEILL
Thor?
THOR
(over intercom)
Greetings, O'Neill. Turn right then enter the door at the end of the
corridor.
INT--THOR'S CHAMBER, BELISKNER
[O'Neill follows the instructions and enters a large chamber. Thor is
lying on a pod.]
THOR
(weakly)
O'Neill
O'NEILL
Thor. You all right?
THOR
I am dying.
O'NEILL
What happened?
THOR
It is, as you humans say, a long story.
O'NEILL
Does this have anything to do with those bugs in the hall?
THOR
I could not transport you directly to this room. The "bugs" as you
call them are attracted to the high energy output of the
transporter.
O'NEILL
What are they?
THOR
They are the enemy of the Asgard.
O'NEILL
This would be the enemy worse than the Goa'uld you told me about?
THOR
I am weak. The information you will need is contained within the
stones.
[Thor indicates a console with stones on it.]
THOR
(cont'd)
Forgive me.
O'NEILL
For what?
[Thor passes out.]
O'NEILL
Thor!
[O'Neill checks to ensure Thor still has a pulse, then walks over to
the console and moves one of the stones. An image of Thor appears on
the screen.]
THOR
Colonel Jack O'Neill. I have made these recordings for you in the
event that I am dead or unable to pass on the necessary information.
Under my command the Beliskner was called into battle against an
enemy we have named Replicators. During the battle this ship became
infested by the technology. The Replicators accessed the computer,
which contained information about your planet, and plotted a course
here. The crew was transported off the ship. I destroyed the
outbound transporter technology to prevent the Replicators from
escaping, and remained in the hopes of stopping the Beliskner from
reaching Earth. If you are watching this recording, then I have
failed, and I have also likely doomed you to certain death.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Teal'c walks into the room; Hammond and Carter are sitting at the
table.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c. Thank you for returning,
TEAL'C
For what matter of urgency have I been summoned, General Hammond?
CARTER
I think I witnessed Colonel O'Neill being transported out of the
base by the Asgard.
TEAL'C
For what purpose?
HAMMOND
We're not sure yet.
[A light appears, and a holographic three dimensional image of O'Neill
appears in the room.]
O'NEILL
Hellooooo? Testing...testing...is this thing on?
CARTER
Colonel!
O'NEILL
Carter!
CARTER
Sir, what's going on?
O'NEILL
Well, I need a SPAS 12, a BF-8, 10 pounds of PBX and a USAS at the
base of the Stargate in, oh...five minutes.
CARTER
That's a lot of explosives, sir.
HAMMOND
May I ask why?
O'NEILL
Yes. Basically Thor's ship has been overrun by a bunch of nasty
techno bugs.
TEAL'C
Were the Asgard not able to defeat them?
O'NEILL
I guess not.
CARTER
So sir, are you saying that these bugs are technological?
O'NEILL
Yeah, apparently they plan to land the ship and infest Earth. Thor
says this would not be a good thing.
HAMMOND
What are you going to do?
O'NEILL
Destroy the ship.
CARTER
Where's Thor?
[O'Neill looks over his shoulder at Thor.]
O'NEILL
Oh he's here. He's just not feeling too well at the moment.
CARTER
We'll be ready in ten minutes, sir. Thor can transport us up there
to help you.
O'NEILL
Thank you, Carter, but that's not going to happen. Thor's out cold.
The bugs got him pretty good. But he did leave some instructions on
how to run the toys up here.
CARTER
So can you transport us up?
O'NEILL
I could. But I'm not going to.
TEAL'C
What is your reasoning, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Anybody who comes up is not gettin' down.
CARTER
Well, sir, if you can't get off the ship...
O'NEILL
Yeah, I know. Look, my time's almost up here. Have the stuff ready
in ten minutes. Wish me luck.
CARTER
Colonel...
O'NEILL
Major, that's an order, and it's final.
HAMMOND
Good luck, Jack.
O'NEILL
Thank you, sir.
[The image of O'Neill disappears. Carter, Hammond and Teal'c look
shocked.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, see that the ordinance is in place.
[Teal'c leaves the briefing room.]
HAMMOND
(cont'd)
Major. To your knowledge, if Colonel O'Neill is unsuccessful, can
the Asgard ship be destroyed by a surface to air strike?
CARTER
Sir, the Asgard ships have sophisticated cloaking devices. We've
been looking for it in orbit since Colonel O'Neill disappeared.
Still nothing.
HAMMOND
So if we can't see it, we can't target it.
[Carter looks thoughtful as though she has an idea.]
INT--BELISKNER
[Thor is lying in the pod as his voice comes from the computer screen.]
THOR
The molecular transportation device has been preprogrammed to target
the area directly in front of your Earth based Stargate.
[O'Neill fast forwards the recording.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, yeah...
THOR
Enter these symbols on the control console in front of you.
[Symbols appear on another screen, and O'Neill inputs them into the
computer.]
THOR
(cont'd)
30 seconds after entering the code, the targeted material will be
transported to the indicated cargo hold.
[O'Neill looks at his watch and heads off to the indicated area.]
THOR
(cont'd)
Remember, the transportation technology emits an energy pulse strong
enough to attract the replicators.
INT--CORRIDORS, BELISKNER
[O'Neill runs down the corridors and reaches a cargo hold. A light
appears in the cargo hold, and Carter and Teal'c appear with the
supplies.]
O'NEILL
Dammit! I gave you people a direct order!
CARTER
General Hammond overruled you, sir. We have a way off the ship.
[They hear the sound of the replicators approaching.]
O'NEILL
Grab what you can. Let's go!
[They grab most of the supplies and run off down the corridor followed
closely by the replicators. Teal'c shoots them with a Zat gun many
times but with no effect. O'Neill shoots them with a gun but they
reintegrate and then seem to be destroyed after the second shot.]
O'NEILL
Let's move!
[All three run down the corridor and enter Thor's chamber.]
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
O'NEILL
Hey buddy. How are you feeling? Uh...you remember Carter and Teal'c?
THOR
Why did you bring them?
[O'Neill looks at Carter and Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Anyone?
TEAL'C
We believed we could be of assistance.
THOR
Now you will all die.
CARTER
Actually, we don't think so. Sir, there's a shuttle preparing on the
launch pad. If we can transmit the coordinates to NASA, they can be
here within a matter of hours. We also brought spacesuits in case an
EVA is required.
THOR
This pod can generate an antigravity field making it easy to move..
CARTER
Does this ship have an air lock?
THOR
Yes.
O'NEILL
So we just plant some PBX, jump ship, and blow it.
THOR
What is PBX?
TEAL'C
An explosive.
O'NEILL
You just have to tell us the best places to plant it.
THOR
All Asgard ships are equipped with internal dampening fields that
activate in the event of an explosion.
O'NEILL
Well, how exactly did you expect us to destroy the ship?
THOR
If I knew a fast simple method, I would have destroyed the ship
myself before endangering your lives.
O'NEILL
Of course you would have!
THOR
The technical specifications of the Beliskner were contained within
the recordings I made for you.
O'NEILL
Oh. Um...I haven't had time to watch all of the stones.
CARTER
What?
[O'Neill indicates the stones on the computer console.]
O'NEILL
Stick those on there.
[Carter moves the stones around, and Thor again appears on the screen
with the ships technical layout.]
THOR
The Beliskner is powered by four neutrino ion generators. In your
Earth units of measurement, each engine outputs a maximum of one
billion kilojoules.
O'NEILL
Yeah. My eyes glazed over about there.
CARTER
I guess I had better go through all of these recordings.
[Thor's voice continues in the background.]
THOR
...Forward propulsion is achieved by two rear thrusters.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC ELEVATOR CORRIDOR
[Major Davis exits the elevator and is greeted by Hammond.]
HAMMOND
Welcome back, Major.
DAVIS
General, I wish it wasn't always under such unusual circumstances.
Any further word on the situation?
HAMMOND
No. We've been unable to make radio contact with SG-1.
DAVIS
It's possible that the Asgard cloaking device is also blocking radio
signals.
HAMMOND
I see you've done your homework, Major.
DAVIS
General, all I do all day long is read up on the Stargate program.
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER,
[Teal'c, Carter and O'Neill are looking at Thor.]
THOR
They were discovered on an isolated planet in our home galaxy some
years ago. The creators were not present.
TEAL'C
Most likely destroyed by their own creation.
THOR
The replicators were brought aboard an Asgard ship for study before
the danger could be fully comprehended.
O'NEILL
We do that all the time. I kinda expected more from you guys.
TEAL'C
Overconfidence in our technologies has been out undoing. The
entities learned from the very means that were employed to stop
them. They have become a plague on our galaxy that is annihilating
everything in its path.
O'NEILL
Why haven't these little buggers landed the ship already?
THOR
Their odds of survival in a new environment depend on numbers. They
are currently feeding off the ship and replicating.
CARTER
What? Are you saying they are actually eating the ship?
THOR
Ingesting the alloys, yes. They will continue until they risk
compromising the integrity of the hull. Then they will land in
search of more raw materials.
CARTER
How intelligent are they?
THOR
Their capacity for learning is extremely high. Each entity is
capable of individual behavior, yet they all act with a common
purpose.
O'NEILL
What's that?
THOR
Self replication.
TEAL'C
Then there does not appear to be a way to stop them.
CARTER
Hang on, Thor. You said that they wouldn't risk compromising the
integrity of the hull?
THOR
Correct.
CARTER
Can this ship withstand an uncontrolled reentry into the atmosphere?
THOR
No, the heat from the friction would cause the ship to burn up.
O'NEILL
Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that with all this advanced
intergalactic technology this ship can't withstand a little heat?
THOR
In order to reflect the subspace field of the phase generators...
O'NEILL
So...no.
THOR
Yes.
CARTER
Then all we have to do is crash the ship into the atmosphere.
THOR
You will have to regain control of the navigational computer.
[O'Neill looks at Carter.]
O'NEILL
Sounds like a plan.
THOR
That can only be done from the bridge.
CARTER
Well, there was a map in the recordings. Can we direct them from
here as they go?
THOR
Yes.
O'NEILL
OK.
[O'Neill and Teal'c head off out of the chamber.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Teal'c appear around the corner with their guns ready.
They hear the sound of the replicators approaching.]
O'NEILL
Hear that?
TEAL'C
They are in the walls, O'Neill.
CARTER
(over radio)
Colonel, can you hear me?
O'NEILL
We hear you!
CARTER
(over radio)
You want to go down that hall.
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[Carter is scrutinizing the computer screen.]
CARTER
Why are some areas flashing?
THOR
They indicate the quadrants of the ship that the replicators have
disabled.
CARTER
How do I zoom in?
THOR
Top left symbol.
[Carter presses the symbol and the screen zooms in to two red dots that
represent O'Neill and Teal'c.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking down the corridor.]
CARTER
(on radio)
You want to go through that door on your left.
[They walk up to the door, open it, and cautiously walk through. There
are replicators all over the walls.]
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
CARTER
Why can't I see any bugs on this screen?
THOR
The first thing the replicators do once aboard an Asgard ship is
disable the sensors capable of detecting them.
CARTER
But I can still see Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.
THOR
They are being detected by the thermal sensors which cannot see the
replicators.
[Thor sighs, and Carter walks over to him.]
CARTER
Are you OK?
THOR
I cannot use the ships automated medical system. If the replicators
have tampered with it, it could kill me.
CARTER
We brought medical supplies, and I have medical field training.
THOR
You cannot help me.
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[Teal'c and O'Neill walk through the doorway and down the corridor.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Are we there yet?
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER,
[Carter moves away from Thor's pod and studies the display.]
CARTER
(into radio)
The door up ahead leads to the bridge.
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[They walk up to the doorway, and there is a metallic sound.]
TEAL'C
It sounds as though there are replicators inside.
O'NEILL
Watch yourself.
[O'Neill opens the door, they stand ready and look inside. The whole of
the bridge is swarming with replicators. O'Neill quickly shuts the
door.]
O'NEILL
Forget that!
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter, carrying the rest of the equipment.]
O'NEILL
OK. New plan!
[Carter opens the cases and checks the equipment.]
CARTER
Nothing's been damaged.
O'NEILL
Good.
[Carter looks over at Thor who is still lying on the pod. She walks
over to O'Neill and talks quietly.]
CARTER
Sir, Thor's not doing so well. He says that pod could put him into
deep stasis that would preserve his life.
O'NEILL
So do it.
CARTER
He won't let me.
[O'Neill walks over to Thor.]
O'NEILL
Hey! I understand you are not being a particularly cooperative
patient.
THOR
As long as I am conscious, I still may be of some assistance.
O'NEILL
Yeah...however, it you are dead...
THOR
As I have said, if you do succeed in destroying the ship, we will
all die.
O'NEILL
And as Carter has said, we might have a way off this ship.
CARTER
Wait a minute, that's it! Thor, you said there are dampening fields
inside the ship that prevent explosions. What about outside the
ship?
THOR
There are shields around the ship, but they would not protect
against a weapon already inside the force field.
CARTER
OK now, there was a specific engine in the information recordings.
It controls reentry.
THOR
The deceleration drive. Yes.
CARTER
We brought an explosive device that's enhanced with elementary
naquadah. Would that be enough to destroy the deceleration drive?
THOR
This plan could work.
O'NEILL
(confused)
Plan...what plan?
CARTER
Sir, the bugs are going to land the ship themselves eventually. The
BF-8 might just be enough fire power to blow the deceleration drive.
O'NEILL
Might?
CARTER
If we blow it at the right time we can alter the reentry path. The
ship would then accelerate out of control and burn up in the Earth's
atmosphere.
[O'Neill rubs his head in confusion.]
TEAL'C
What needs to be done then is to place this explosive outside of
this vessel.
CARTER
Someone's going to have to go out there.
O'NEILL
Of course they are!
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel climbs the stairs into the room very slowly and carefully.
Hammond sees him coming and walks out of his office.]
HAMMOND
What are you doing down here, Dr. Jackson?
DANIEL
I've just been informed, sir. I was wondering if there was anything
I could do to help?
[Major Davis enters the control room.]
DAVIS
General, we're going to DEFCON 3. The Russians have gone on alert as
a response. The moment the Asgard ship attempts to land, the
President had decided to let the rest of the world know what we
know.
HAMMOND
And then?
DAVIS
We hit it with everything we've got.
DANIEL
Uh, SG-1 is on that ship!
DAVIS
I have as much confidence in SG-1 as you Dr. Jackson. But they left
over an hour ago. We've had no communication since. We have no idea
what kind of a timeframe we're dealing with here.
HAMMOND
Let's give them a reasonable chance, Major.
DAVIS
Yes, sir. I'll try to define "reasonable" to the Pentagon.
[Hammond looks at a worried Daniel. The DEFCON signal flashes to 3, and
a siren goes off.]
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[O'Neill and Carter look at a diagram of the ship on a screen.]
CARTER
The bugs haven't overrun the part of the ship where the air lock is
yet.
O'NEILL
Let's do it.
[Carter looks at the spacesuits.]
CARTER
Each tank has six hours of oxygen. Whoever goes should have plenty
of time.
TEAL'C
I will go.
O'NEILL
I was going to do it.
CARTER
There is a radiation concern, sir.
TEAL'C
My symbiote protects me from exposure to radiation for a long period
of time.
O'NEILL
OK. You go.
[Teal'c nods in agreement.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking down the corridor. Teal'c is wearing a
spacesuit.]
CARTER
(on radio)
It looks like the top button opens the inner door, the middle one
depressurizes the airlock, and the bottom one opens the outer door.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Roger that.
[O'Neill helps Teal'c pull his helmet down.]
O'NEILL
(keying his radio)
Can you hear me?
TEAL'C
(through radio)
Indeed.
O'NEILL
You might want to think about hangin' on tight out there...lets do
it.
[He opens the airlock door. Teal'c steps inside, and the door closes
and starts to depressurize.]
O'NEILL
Say something.
TEAL'C
One small step for Jaffa.
O'NEILL
Very nice.
[Some corrosive liquid drops onto Teal'c's oxygen canisters, but Teal'c
and O'Neill do not notice. O'Neill opens the outer door. Teal'c gives a
thumbs up gesture which O'Neill acknowledges, and Teal'c floats
outside, the explosive on a tether attached to Teal'c's spacesuit.]
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[Carter watches the process on a monitor in Thor's chamber.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill tries to look for Teal'c through the windows.]
EXT--SPACE IN EARTH'S ORBIT
[Teal'c floats over to the specified area and sets up the explosive.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[O'Neill is waiting next to the airlock door. He hears the approach of
replicators.]
O'NEILL
Oh, Crap!
(keys radio)
Teal'c, how's it going?
TEAL'C
I am returning.
O'NEILL
I don't suppose you could step on it, could you?
TEAL'C
I am going as quickly as possible, O'Neill.
[The outer airlock door closes. O'Neill tries to open it using the
controls, but nothing happens.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Carter!
INT--BELISKNER THOR'S CHAMBER
[Carter moves the control stones around while watching the display.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Yes sir, I'm working on it.
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[Teal'c arrives at the airlock door but can't get in.]
TEAL'C
The door will not open.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Hang on.
[A few replicators enter the airlock through the ceiling.]
O'NEILL
Oh God!
[The oxygen tank on Teal'c's pack blows from the corrosive.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
His tank just blew!
TEAL'C
O'Neill!
O'NEILL
Carter!
CARTER
Sir, I'm trying to use the transporter to beam him inside but it's
not working. The transporter array on that side of the ship must
have been knocked out by the bugs. We can still do this but Teal'c
is going to have to push off.
O'NEILL
What!
CARTER
The other transporter arrays can pick him up but only if he's far
enough away from the ship.
[Teal'c starts gasping for air as the tank runs out.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, we're going to try to beam you aboard. But you have to push
off from the ship first. You read? You have to push off!
[Teal'c pushes away from the ship. Carter looks at Thor.]
CARTER
He's taking too long. Isn't there some way to re-aim the transporter
array?
[Thor gasps. He passes out and an alarm sounds.]
CARTER
Damn!
[O'Neill, at the airlock, looks anxiously at Teal'c in space.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
[She works at the console.]
CARTER
I'm trying!
[On the computer screen in Thor's chamber, Teal'c has at last reached
the beam out point.]
CARTER
Got it!
[Teal'c is beamed into the Beliskner near to O'Neill. He falls to the
floor. O'Neill rushes up to him and pulls his helmet up.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c! Teal'c?
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[In Thor's chamber the alarms on his pod are still blaring. Carter runs
over and puts him into stasis.]
INT--BELISKNER CORRIDOR
[Back at the airlock O'Neill is trying to revive Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Come on, come on...breathe!
[Teal'c opens his eyes.]
O'NEILL
Oh yeah! That's following orders. Can you move?
TEAL'C
I can, O'Neill.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond walks over to the gate technician.]
HAMMOND
Still no communication of any kind?
TECHNICIAN
No sir and NORAD's still reporting no sign of the alien ship.
[Hammond walks up to Daniel, who is looking pale and in pain.]
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson, are you OK?
DANIEL
I'll be fine.
HAMMOND
Why don't you go back up to the infirmary? I promise you I will
notify you as soon as there is any news.
DANIEL
Sir, I know that there is no reason for me to be here. But I
just...I feel like I should be here...that's not totally true. I
feel I actually should be out there with them.
HAMMOND
Now you know how I feel most of the time.
INT--BELISKNER, THOR'S CHAMBER
[O'Neill is helping Teal'c into the room.]
CARTER
According to the schematic, that was the only one left untouched by
the bugs. You going to be OK?
TEAL'C
I will be fine.
[O'Neill sees Thor's pod.]
O'NEILL
What happened?
CARTER
He was dying. I had to put him into stasis.
O'NEILL
So...?
CARTER
So, we wait and blow the bomb at the right time.
O'NEILL
Which is when?
CARTER
When we start to enter the atmosphere. Too early, and theoretically
the entry could be aborted by the bugs. If we wait too long into the
descent, the bomb could burn off before we could detonate.
[O'Neill pauses in thought.]
O'NEILL
Think you could fix that beam down thing?
CARTER
Not without Thor's help, sir.
O'NEILL
I'd better contact Hammond. Let him know what to expect.
[He tries the console but nothing happens.]
O'NEILL
All right, this thing's not workin'!
[They hear replicators in the walls.]
TEAL'C
Thor was correct, we are going to die.
O'NEILL
Aww, come on Teal'c, lighten up! We've been in these situations
before.
CARTER
No, sir, we haven't.
O'NEILL
We haven't?
EXT--SPACE
[Beliskner begins its descent.]
INT--BELISKNER THOR'S CHAMBER
TEAL'C
The vessel is beginning its descent.
[Carter looks very thoughtful.]
CARTER
I have an idea, sir.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and Davis enter the room.]
TECHNICIAN
Sir, NORAD's reporting that they've spotted an unidentified object
entering the upper atmosphere over the Pacific.
[Daniel is listening to the communications.]
DANIEL
They've disabled the ship's cloaking device.
TECHNICIAN 2
Object's on a controlled entry.
TECHNICIAN
Projected landing on the West Coast of the United States, sir.
DAVIS
Of course this could also be a sign that they've already lost the
battle.
[Hammond picks up the phone.]
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond. At this time I recommend going to DEFCON 2.
Deploy all available assets to intercept the alien ship.
DANIEL
General!
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson, but if that ship makes it through the
atmosphere intact, we have no choice to assume SG-1 failed. We must
destroy it by whatever means necessary.
[A siren sounds as the sign goes from DEFCON 3 to DEFCON 2. Daniel
sighs.]
INT--BELISKNER
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking down a corridor with their guns ready,
closing doors as they go.]
O'NEILL
All right, Carter, let's do it!
[Carter is working the console in Thor's chamber.]
CARTER
Here we go!
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
DAVIS
The Russians have also spotted the incoming object and are
inquiring.
HAMMOND
The Joint Chiefs will respond.
[The Gate room is enveloped in a bright light, and the Stargate
disappears. Everyone is shocked.]
INT--BELISKNER CARGO ROOM
[The Stargate materializes inside the room.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
DAVIS
We'll have to call you back.
DANIEL
(excited)
They're going to use it to escape!
DAVIS
Like you did from the Apophis mother ship. It could work!
DANIEL
It will work, they...they'll gate to another planet and then home!
HAMMOND
You had a DHD. They don't.
DAVIS
Even disconnected, there should be enough power to dial out once.
[Hammond walks over to the telephone.]
HAMMOND
This is Hammond. I want the Beta Gate unpacked from storage
immediately. Yes, you heard me. I want it unsealed and ready for use
as soon as humanly possible!
INT--BELISKNER CARGO ROOM
[Teal'c is manually dialing out.]
O'NEILL
Where are we going?
TEAL'C
P3X-234.
O'NEILL
I hear it's nice this time of year.
[Teal'c continues to dial, the chevrons locking into place. The
replicators burn through the walls of the chamber. O'Neill stands
ready.]
O'NEILL
We got bugs!
[The replicators enter the room and O'Neill shoots at them. Carter gets
ready to leave Thor's chamber with Thor in stasis. O'Neill fires his
gun rapidly in the cargo room.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill!
[O'Neill shoots the replicator nearing Teal'c as Teal'c continues to
dial.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
TECHNICIAN
Bandit is still on controlled entry. Present heading 196!
INT--BELISKNER CARGO ROOM
[Teal'c locks the last chevron. O'Neill is standing in front of the
gate firing at the bugs.]
TEAL'C
Get down!
[O'Neill crouches down as the gate opens and then continues firing at
the replicators. Teal'c begins to fire his weapon as well.]
O'NEILL
Let's go, Carter!
[Carter materializes next to the open gate with Thor in the stasis pod
floating next to her. All three fire their guns at the replicators.]
O'NEILL
Can we blow this thing yet?
[Carter pushes Thor's pod through the Stargate.]
O'NEILL
Carter!
CARTER
Not yet!
EXT--SPACE
[Beliskner enters the atmosphere.]
INT--BELISKNER CARGO ROOM
[Masses of replicators enter the room. Carter, O'Neill, and Teal'c back
up towards the gate.]
O'NEILL
Carter!
EXT--SPACE/EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE, DAY
[The Beliskner is now traveling through the upper atmosphere, the heat
from reentry hitting the shields.]
INT--BELISKNER CARGO HOLD
CARTER
Now!
[O'Neill presses the trigger for the bomb.]
EXT--EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE, DAY
[The bomb explodes and the Beliskner starts an uncontrolled reentry.
The ship begins to break apart.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[A computer screen shows a red dot representing the Beliskner.]
DAVIS
(on telephone)
I understand that, Captain. What I need to know is what do you see.
Do you have a visual?
DAVIS
(to Hammond)
Tenth's squadron's airborne on intercept course.
TECHNICIAN
The target has changed heading! It's dropped out of controlled entry
vector. The target is breaking up.
DAVIS
We have visual confirmation. A fireball heading for the Pacific
Ocean. 400 miles off the coast of California!
[Hammond looks at Daniel in concern.]
EXT--PACIFIC OCEAN, DAY
[A fireball hits the ocean.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
DAVIS
Naval recovery teams are moving in to deal with any wreckage...
[Daniel looks at him.]
DAVIS
I'm sure you were right, Dr. Jackson. The point of commandeering the
Stargate had to be an escape.
[Daniel looks into the Gate room.]
DANIEL
I just hope they made it out in time.
EXT--PACIFIC OCEAN
[There are bits of wreckage floating on the water. One of the
replicators clambers out of the ocean and onto the wreckage...]
TO BE CONTINUED...
FADE OUT
