TEASER
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Landry exits the elevator on Level 28 and begins walking briskly. He's
wearing a leather flight jacket over his regular uniform. Carter
catches up with him and walks alongside him.]
CARTER
Sir.
LANDRY
Colonel.
CARTER
(handing him a file)
I need you to read this.
LANDRY
Good morning to you too, Colonel.
CARTER
(smiling)
Sorry sir. How are you?
LANDRY
What is it?
CARTER
It's a report from the Tok'ra. They've discovered a gravitational
disturbance with their long range sensors.
LANDRY
Another Ori incursion.
CARTER
Well, it could simply be a yet undiscovered black hole, but the
Tok'ra won't have a ship in range for some time. I've located a
planet with a Stargate close to the disturbance. If you'll permit me
to take a sci--
LANDRY
Go! SG-5 should be available.
[She stops as he continues on.]
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[The klaxons are sounding. Landry descends the stairs from his office.]
HARRIMAN
Unscheduled off-world activation.
LANDRY
Walter?
HARRIMAN
We're receiving an iris code, sir. It's Colonel Carter.
LANDRY
That was fast. Open the iris.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
[Harriman moves to obey as Landry exits.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Carter, Altman, and the rest of SG-5 exit the wormhole and walk down
the ramp. Landry enters. SF's are positioned at the base of the ramp.]
LANDRY
Colonel! Tell me you've got good news.
CARTER
Actually, sir, I think there was a little glitch. We were on the
wrong planet, sir.
LANDRY
Was the intel wrong?
ALTMAN
No, sir. When we arrived, there was no sign of the MALP.
CARTER
I checked our telemetry based on known star positions.
ALTMAN
We weren't on P3X-584, sir.
CARTER
(concerned)
Somehow, we got sent to a different planet.
LANDRY
(calling up to the control room)
Walter?
HARRIMAN
(over intercom)
I'm reviewing gate diagnostics, sir.
LANDRY
(turning back to Carter)
How could this happen?
CARTER
If it is a gate malfunction, it's a pretty big one. Unlike any we've
seen before.
LANDRY
(to Harriman)
Chief, inform all off-world teams to use the Alpha Site until
further notice.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
(to Carter)
If there's something wrong with this gate, I want to know what it is
before anyone else walks through it.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
Find the problem. Until we do, all gate activity is shut down.
[Altman and Carter exchange concerned looks.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Harriman is looking at the main computer monitor as Carter looks over
his shoulder.]
CARTER
Run the cross-comparison program.
[Daniel enters.]
DANIEL
Hey! How's it going?
CARTER
Well as far as our computer is concerned, the dialing sequence to
P3X-584 ran perfectly normal.
DANIEL
Except for the fact you ended up twelve thousand light years off
course.
HARRIMAN
Oh, here's something.
[The monitor shows a large-amplitude bump in the signal recorded from
the gate. The monitor flashes with the indicator "Abnormal Signature".]
CARTER
Huh. Maybe it wasn't our fault.
DANIEL
I thought it was always our fault.
CARTER
We just ran a program that compares the energy signatures of the
last thirty outbound trips to look for anomalies.
HARRIMAN
It's kinda like a...bump.
DANIEL
A bump?
[Harriman zooms out the view to show the bump occurring a regular
intervals.]
CARTER
Actually, more like a series of bumps, exactly 8.5 seconds apart.
DANIEL
(kidding)
Oh! Well, that explains everything.
CARTER
Actually, it might.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[A picture of the signal with its bumps is displayed on a large screen.
Landry stands near the screen, and SG-1 is seated at the table.]
LANDRY
Defense mechanism?
CARTER
Yes, sir. I think each of these spikes represents a request by the
off-world gate for an authorization code.
TEAL'C
If the correct authorization code is not entered in time, we are
prevented from reaching the planet.
LANDRY
(sitting at the head of the table)
That doesn't explain how you and SG-5 ended up half way across the
galaxy.
CARTER
Well, I have a theory about that, too. Instead of using an iris,
like we do, the off-world gate stores incoming data in its buffer
system. Then, if the correct code isn't received, it dials a random
address and empties the buffer into the new wormhole.
MITCHELL
Interstellar call forwarding, huh? That's pretty cool.
DANIEL
How did the MALP get through to 584? I mean, initial telemetry
confirmed it was on the right planet.
CARTER
My guess is the 584 security system filters incoming matter based on
certain protocol. Organic versus inanimate, for instance.
DANIEL
Wow! That seems like an awful lot of trouble to keep people out.
CARTER
Which makes me curious as to what's being hidden there.
MITCHELL
Always want what you can't have.
CARTER
I've calculated it'll take the Prometheus two weeks to reach 584 at
maximum speed.
TEAL'C
If the Ori are constructing a Supergate there, we may not have that
much time. I will contact the High Council and have a Jaffa ship
scout the area.
LANDRY
(to Carter)
Can you figure out a way to crack this authorization code?
CARTER
We'll certainly try, sir.
LANDRY
Teal'c, no offense, but I'd feel better if we investigated this
ourselves.
[Teal'c nods.]
LANDRY
Dismissed.
[Everyone gets up from the table.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[The gate is active; a MALP enters the wormhole. SG-1 and SG-5 wait at
the base of the ramp, except for Carter.]
HARRIMAN
MALP is en-route.
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Landry stand behind Harriman.]
CARTER
We placed a bacterial culture inside the MALP's cargo compartment.
Hopefully, the organic material will force the 584 gate to hold the
MALP and ask for an authorization code.
HARRIMAN
I'm receiving the gate's authorization request.
CARTER
Now we just hope this program works.
[A display screen shows seven rows of numbers, each changing very
rapidly. Next to each row, in sequence, a large green indicator with
the text "LOCK" appears. All seven rows show green very quickly.]
LANDRY
What does that mean?
CARTER
I think it was good.
HARRIMAN
The MALP is coming online.
CARTER
Rotate the camera to the left.
[The video return shows the MALP camera swinging to the left, revealing
another MALP.]
CARTER
(pleased)
It's the first MALP. It worked.
LANDRY
Good!
[Carter exits.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
EXT--P3X-584, DAY
[SG-1 exits the wormhole, followed by SG-5.]
MITCHELL
All right, let's see what all the fuss is about.
CARTER
Well, we'll have to wait till nightfall to get a visual confirmation
of the black hole. In the meantime, Major, you can set up the
gravity sensors.
[Altman nods and moves off with his team.]
CARTER
I'll make sure we can dial home.
[Carter moves off to the DHD. Mitchell activates the video link on the
MALP.]
MITCHELL
SGC, this is SG-1 leader. We have arrived safely.
LANDRY
(via radio)
Thank you Colonel. We'll dial again in 15 minutes. Prometheus is
standing by.
MITCHELL
Hopefully that won't be necessary, sir. Mitchell out.
[He turns off the video link, and the gate shuts down. He turns to
Daniel and Teal'c.]
MITCHELL
I'd rather not wait around two weeks for a ride.
DANIEL
We're gonna go have a look around.
[Mitchell nods, and Daniel and Teal'c walk away. Mitchell heads over to
speak with Carter. She is kneeling by the DHD, which has a small piece
of advanced-looking technology attached to it, on the pedestal base. It
appears to be active, with blinking lights. She has attached probes to
it from her laptop.]
CARTER
I think I found the problem.
MITCHELL
You seen anything like it before?
CARTER
Nope. And I don't want to remove it until I know exactly how it's
connected to the system. Good news is, it won't affect any outbound
dialing.
ALTMAN
(over radio)
Colonel Carter. We've got the gravity sensors up and running.
CARTER
(into radio)
Good. I'll be right there.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Hey guys, it's Daniel. You might wanna come and check this out
first.
MITCHELL
(to Carter)
I got it. You check out the black hole.
[They nod to each other and move off.]
[Some moments later, Mitchell arrives at a clearing to find Daniel and
Teal'c examining a ring platform.]
MITCHELL
Wow, it's amazing what people leave laying around! Where do those
go?
DANIEL
Only one way to find out.
INT--UNDERGROUND CAVE ENTRANCE, P3X-584
[The rings deposit the three at the entrance to a cave. Once they
deactivate, it is pitch black throughout. They turn on bright
flashlights and enter the cave. There is equipment in the room,
including a pedestal near the entrance, but all is inert now.]
MITCHELL
I don't think anyone's been home for a while.
DANIEL
Looks like some kind of science lab.
TEAL'C
(referring to a raised circular platform on the floor)
This looks familiar. It's Nirrti's DNA Manipulation Device.
MITCHELL
Nirrti? She was the Goa'uld that was trying to create an advanced
host, right? Ended up with a bunch of super freaks who turned on
her. That was a cool file.
[Daniel presses some buttons on the pedestal. The DNA device activates,
showing a color hologram of a DNA strand with labels written in yellow
pointing to individual genes.]
DANIEL
This writing's in Ancient.
[Mitchell shines his flashlight across the room. He sees something and
walks toward it.]
MITCHELL
Oh, I was wrong.
[His flashlight reveals a man standing up in a stasis chamber, his
upper body unclothed. It is Khalek.]
MITCHELL
There is someone home.
[Mitchell walks up the chamber. To his right he sees a control panel
with several buttons on it, each labeled in Ancient. He reaches for
one.]
DANIEL
Wait! Wait!
[Mitchell hits the button as Daniel is warning him.]
MITCHELL
What? I was looking for the light switch.
[There is the sound of something activating. Daniel walks through the
DNA hologram to Mitchell's side. He sighs and points his flashlight at
Mitchell's chest.]
DANIEL
New guy!
MITCHELL
(referring to the pedestal)
Hey, you touched that!
DANIEL
Uh, I know how to read that!
[The glass-like cover in front of the chamber frosts over and then
disappears. Khalek inside starts to fall forward. Daniel sets his
flashlight down and catches him, lowering him gently to the ground.]
DANIEL
(feeling the man's neck)
I got a faint pulse.
[The man starts to convulse, seemingly having a seizure.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Carter, get back to the gate. Tell the SGC we need a med team here,
right away!
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Mitchell and Carter are seated across from each other on the edge of
infirmary beds, dressed except for their outer BDU shirts. Lam is
looking at some film on an x-ray viewer, then turns to them. Khalek is
in a bed behind them.]
LAM
Well, you're clean. No sign of any exposure to infectious agents.
MITCHELL
Great! How's pod man?
[Mitchell and Carter stand up and put on their outer shirts.]
LAM
Also going to be fine. I suspect the convulsions were just a
reaction to coming out of stasis. Although, his preliminary test
results were quite interesting.
CARTER
How?
LAM
We've been able to study the genetic characteristics of the Ancients
from the database sent back to us from Atlantis. Our Patient X
definitely shows some physiological similarities.
CARTER
You think he's an Ancient?
LAM
I'm running a more detailed analysis. There are some other strange
anomalies. But in the meantime, why don't we ask him?
[They walk over to Khalek's bed. A nurse who has been tending him walks
away. Lam touches Khalek on the shoulder.]
LAM
Hello?
[Khalek starts to rouse, partially opening his eyes and taking a deep
breath.]
LAM
I'm Doctor Carolyn Lam. Do you understand me?
KHALEK
Yes.
LAM
Good. Try to relax. There's nothing to be afraid of. You're safe.
You're on a planet called Earth.
CARTER
I'm Lt. Col. Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force.
MITCHELL
Cameron Mitchell. Ditto on the other stuff.
CARTER
Can you tell us your name?
KHALEK
(struggling to speak)
It's Khalek.
CARTER
Khalek. We found you on another planet, in stasis. In what looked
like some sort of science lab.
KHALEK
(to Lam)
Earth?
MITCHELL
Yeah, that's right.
KHALEK
I want to go home.
CARTER
Home? Where is home?
KHALEK
(struggling)
He took me. I was a prisoner... So long... He did experiments on me.
MITCHELL
He, who?
KHALEK
I never knew his name.
(pleading)
Please, I just want to go home.
MITCHELL
Can you tell us what this guy looks like?
CARTER
Do you have the stargate address for the planet you call home? The
symbols to dial?
KHALEK
Yes.
[Lam sees that Khalek is fading and stops the questions.]
LAM
Okay. When you're feeling better, we'll see what we can do.
[Lam shakes her head. Carter nods, and she and Mitchell exit.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF INFIRMARY
MITCHELL
So, not an Ancient.
CARTER
Too bad. Poor guy. This is exactly what Nirrti did. Kidnap people
and then experimented on them.
MITCHELL
Yeah but, Khalek there said 'he'.
CARTER
Well, I'm sure Nirrti wasn't the only Goa'uld with an interest in
evolved human hosts.
MITCHELL
That lab looked more Ancient than Goa'uld.
CARTER
You think it was an Ancient experimenting on him?
MITCHELL
I don't know. But I'm sure Jackson will get to the bottom of it.
CARTER
In the meantime, we'll get the address to Khalek's home-world and
send a MALP. Hopefully, it'll still be somewhere he wants to go back
to.
INT--LABORATORY ON P3X-584
[Daniel is working with the computers in the lab. A monitor shows
writing in Ancient, but the power is fluctuating, causing noise and
making the monitor images come and go. He hears the rings activate and
turns to see who is coming. It is Teal'c, Altman, and one of Altman's
men. Altman and his man are carrying equipment boxes.]
DANIEL
Hey, what's up?
ALTMAN
Well, it looks like that black hole's just a regular old black hole.
No giant Ori Supergate.
DANIEL
Uh, that's good.
ALTMAN
Teal'c said you could use some help in here.
DANIEL
Yeah, there's something wrong with the power supply. It's driving me
nuts.
ALTMAN
Well, we'll look into it.
[Altman and the airman go to investigate.]
TEAL'C
Colonel Mitchell says the man we found in stasis is not an Ancient.
He was being held prisoner and experimented upon. They do not
believe that he knew his captor. Have you found anything, Daniel
Jackson?
DANIEL
Uh, just pages and pages of logs. Notes about the exper--
[He stops to read something on the screen. He appears very concerned.]
TEAL'C
What is it?
DANIEL
Oh, this is bad.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Daniel and Teal'c exit the wormhole, and it shuts down. Landry waits
for him at the base of the ramp.]
DANIEL
(walking down the ramp)
Where is he?
LANDRY
Isolation Room One.
DANIEL
Under guard?
LANDRY
Why? What did you find?
DANIEL
I should have known when I saw the Ancient writing. He used to use
it as code on his ships.
LANDRY
Doctor Jackson.
TEAL'C
The lab does not belong to an Ancient.
DANIEL
It belonged to Anubis.
LANDRY
But he's long gone now.
DANIEL
Yes, but the man he left behind is not the victim of experiments.
He's a genetic hybrid. He was grown in that lab.
LANDRY
I'm sorry?
DANIEL
Whatever he told you, he's lying. The Goa'uld pass on genetic
memory. Now he may not have a snake in his head, but the man we
defrosted and brought back here has Goa'uld DNA intermingled with
his own. He may as well be the--the son of Anubis.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[A computer monitor shows Khalek in Isolation Room One, strapped into a
specialized metal chair. Teal'c, Carter, Mitchell, Lam, and Landry are
seated at the table while Daniel stands.]
DANIEL
The log entry said Anubis managed to replicate his pre-ascension DNA
using the genetic manipulation device. Then, he combined it with
human DNA and was able to rapidly grow our-- our friend there.
[Daniel sits next to Teal'c.]
LAM
The analysis I did suggests that Khalek is significantly more
evolved than we are. Much more in line with the human form of the
Ancients prior to ascension.
MITCHELL
So he could have all kinds of super funky powers?
CARTER
Well, the subjects Nirrti manipulated demonstrated telekinetic and
psychic abilities.
MITCHELL
Like the Priors?
DANIEL
The goal of the experiment seems to have been to create an advanced
human.
LANDRY
With a little Anubis blended in.
CARTER
You said he used his pre-ascended DNA. Do you think he was doing
these experiments before he ascended?
DANIEL
No. See, that timeline doesn't track with the log. Plus it says he
had to reproduce his DNA. Which means he was doing all this after he
ascended and was sent back by the Ancients. Well, halfway.
CARTER
But this doesn't make any sense. Even a highly evolved human host
wouldn't be as advanced as he was. Why bother?
MITCHELL
Maybe he didn't like being stuck in limbo. Maybe even a small step
back to mortality was worth it to him on some level.
TEAL'C
Perhaps he was attempting to create an even more powerful servant
than the Kull warriors.
DANIEL
No matter what Anubis' ultimate goal was, Khalek is extremely
dangerous.
LANDRY
Options?
MITCHELL
Put him back in his pod.
CARTER
I doubt we'd be able to get the one from 584 back here.
TEAL'C
If we leave him there, others could circumvent the security and find
him as we did.
CARTER
We could post guards.
MITCHELL
What about the Antarctica pod?
DANIEL
Look, I think we need to consider whether we want to preserve him at
all!
LANDRY
Hmmm.
[Everyone reflects on this for a moment. Lam looks troubled by the
suggestion.]
DANIEL
Look, the fact is, we don't know how successful Anubis was. Khalek
is advanced, yes, but we don't know how far along he actually is.
Now, if he is aware of his own state of evolutionary advancement,
and I'll bet you anything he is, it is possible the only thing
keeping him from ascending right now is that he hasn't figured out
how.
LANDRY
What would that take?
DANIEL
I don't know. But if he can do it. If--if he knows how or figures
out how, at the very least, we're going to have another Anubis on
our hands. And at that point, it's going to be too late to stop him.
CARTER
Well he couldn't progress his state of being while he was in stasis.
DANIEL
Look, you know I would never suggest this lightly. But he is what he
is. And given the danger he poses, I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is the point in keeping him alive at all?
[Carter nods at Daniel's argument, while Teal'c looks pensive, Lam
shocked, and Mitchell serious.]
LANDRY
I hear you, Doctor Jackson. For the moment, we're taking every
security precaution we can. I'll contact Washington. Discuss how
we're going to proceed. In the meantime, I suggest all of you learn
as much as you can, including what Khalek does and doesn't know.
[Daniel appears troubled.]
INT--ISOLATION ROOM OBSERVATION AREA
[Daniel enters and sits at the table overlooking the isolation room.
Khalek is strapped into the highly mechanized chair by the arms and
legs, his head down. He has leads running from his chest, and a nearby
computer monitor shows his vital functions. His image also appears on
computer monitors next to Daniel. The comm system is active. Daniel
picks up a pen to take notes on the pad he has brought in.]
DANIEL
Khalek, can you hear me?
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek lifts his head. He has a pitiable weakness and vulnerability in
his demeanor.]
KHALEK
Yes.
DANIEL
My name is Doctor Daniel Jackson.
[Khalek realizes he is restrained and looks around apprehensively. The
following dialog switches frequently in point of view between the
observation area and the isolation room itself.]
KHALEK
Why have you restrained me like this? Why is everyone suddenly
acting like they fear me?
DANIEL
Look, you can drop the act.
KHALEK
I don't understand. Have you contacted my home-world?
DANIEL
We found you on your home-world. I understand Ancient. Those
research notes Anubis left? We know that you were grown in that lab.
That you possess Anubis's DNA and his genetic memories.
[Khalek lowers his head while keeping his eyes on Daniel; his
expression goes from fearful to menacing.]
KHALEK
(smiling)
My memories do include you, Doctor Jackson. The confrontation you
once had with my father. I sense it is some time since I was last
awake. What has become of him?
DANIEL
(firmly)
I'm not here to answer your questions.
KHALEK
The others. They wish to study me, don't they? Why else would I
still be here, given the danger you know I pose? They want to learn
what I am. How I came to be. But you... Have you ever taken a life,
Doctor Jackson?
[Daniel blinks but does not respond.]
KHALEK
I believe you have...killed a man.
(closing his eyes)
My memories are so sharp and clear. It's as if they happened only
moments ago. The countless lives my father extinguished. Of those
that came before him and did the same.
(eyes still closed, nearly rapturous)
Such pleasure it gave them. But I have not experienced it myself
yet.
(opening his eyes to look at Daniel)
Does it really feel that good?
[Daniel looks aside, sets his pen down, and puts his hand to his face
as if he is losing interest, as Khalek continues.]
KHALEK
Millions of slaves bowing before me. A galaxy of desperate, pitiful
life-forms at my feet. That's clearly intoxicating. I can almost
taste it, as if it was me there and not those whose memories I
possess. Oh, but nothing, nothing do I anticipate more than the
sweetness I know I will feel when I kill for the first time. I can
hardly wait to watch as fear stops a man's heart. So much more
intimate, one-on-one. To watch as the blood flows from his veins and
savor his ever-fading hope for life.
[Daniel now appears to be studying Khalek, his brow furrowed.]
KHALEK
There's only one way to stop it. I know you wish to take my life,
and I promise you, before this is over, one of us will feel the
pleasure.
[Khalek smiles. Daniel smiles faintly, as if he doesn't want to appear
disturbed in front of Khalek. He looks to his left, quickly picks up
his pen and pad of paper, and leaves. Khalek smiles in rapture and
closes his eyes, taken up by his inherited memories.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Landry and Daniel are studying some notes when Woolsey enters.]
LANDRY
Mr. Woolsey! Given the timing, this can't be a good sign.
WOOLSEY
The International Committee overseeing the SGC has read and
considered your recommendation to place the prisoner back in stasis.
LANDRY
At least until we can decide what to do with him.
WOOLSEY
We think that's a mistake.
LANDRY
Oh, you think we should kill him.
WOOLSEY
On the contrary. We think he must be studied.
[Landry chuckles at the audacity.]
DANIEL
You understand how dangerous he is.
WOOLSEY
We understand how dangerous you seem to think he is. There's very
little corroborating evidence at this point. That's why more study
is required.
LANDRY
Is this a joke? 'Cause if you look closely, I'm not laughing.
WOOLSEY
You and your people went before the Senate Appropriations Committee
and demanded that the budget for this facility not be cut in half.
Why? Because of a formidable new enemy that now threatens our
galaxy.
LANDRY
What would we do without you?
WOOLSEY
All we have heard is that the Ori must be taken more seriously than
the Goa'uld. That the Priors who represent them are extremely
powerful and dangerous in their own right. And yet, in the months
since this threat emerged, not one proposed counter measure. Not one
shred of technology. Not even so much as a theory or strategy to
fight these missionaries, has resulted from ongoing stargate
operations. Until now. And you want to freeze him.
LANDRY
Go! Go! You're on a roll.
WOOLSEY
Based on the report, the only thing that we do know about this
Khalek is that physiologically he may be very much like the Priors
of the Ori. An advanced form of human, far along in evolutionary
development. First and foremost, studying him, may be the key to
learning a way to fight the Priors.
LANDRY
Actually, that had not escaped me.
WOOLSEY
Not to mention the fact that he may be the missing link between
ourselves and ascension. Certainly that merits more research. The
members of the Committee feel very strongly about this.
DANIEL
Then neither they, nor you, understand the risks.
WOOLSEY
Oh, we do. The issue is, if this Command doesn't have the ability
and security in place to take full advantage of an opportunity like
this, then we believe we need to reevaluate its leadership. And
ultimately, its operation.
INT--LABORATORY ON P3X-584
[Airmen work on the DNA pedestal as Daniel and Mitchell talk.]
MITCHELL
If Woolsey and the bean counters are going to force us to keep
Khalek conscious, maybe we'd better figure out what he's capable of,
and fast.
DANIEL
It was like he was goading me into killing him. Like he wanted us to
do it.
MITCHELL
He know's he's on the path to ascension. Maybe he thinks that's the
final step.
DANIEL
Well, if that's the case, we may have no other choice but to freeze
him again.
MITCHELL
With strict instructions never to defrost.
TEAL'C
Indeed. Unfortunately, we must now convince others this is the
prudent course of action.
DANIEL
Major Altman seems to think he has something that'll help us.
ALTMAN
(holding up a small device)
Yeah, this unit; it seems to be self contained. Well, it's what
analyzes a subject's current physiological status and feeds back
into the DNA manipulator. We should be able to bring it back with us
and rig it to give us a better idea of how advanced Khalek really
is.
MITCHELL
(nodding)
That'd be good. Nice work.
DANIEL
I'm gonna keep working on the translation.
[Mitchell waves as he and the others leave.]
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek is strapped to the chair, his head hung forward. Altman is
attaching leads to Anubis' monitoring unit, which is attached to the
headrest of the chair. Carter is working on a computer terminal behind
him. Lam watches Mitchell, who is holding a ready Zat on Khalek.]
LAM
(emphatic)
He's out cold, Colonel. I gave him enough sedative to keep him out
for hours.
MITCHELL
Can't be too sure.
[Woolsey and Landry are watching from the observation room. Altman
connects another lead, and green lasers activate from the monitoring
unit and point into the back of Khalek's head.]
ALTMAN
That...should be good.
[An image of a brain appears on the computer terminal as Carter and Lam
look on. There are blue and red patches on the image. Various areas are
labeled on the brain, but the labels are all written in Ancient.]
CARTER
We're pretty sure these red patches indicate areas of the brain
where synaptic activity is maximized. A normal human brain, you or I
say, should show roughly five to ten percent coverage.
MITCHELL
Me being five, you being ten.
[Carter smiles teasingly at Mitchell.]
ALTMAN
So what's it at now? Sixty percent?
CARTER
Sixty-eight, exactly. Daniel says the research theorized that
eighty, possible ninety percent activity was required for conscious,
willful ascension.
MITCHELL
So he's not there yet.
CARTER
Well no, but--
LAM
Wait a minute. What's that?
[Lam points to a red area on the scan image.]
LAM
That wasn't there a minute ago.
CARTER
No. The percentage just jumped to seventy-one.
MITCHELL
(walking around the room, his Zat against his chest)
Are you saying this guy is evolving right before our eyes?
[A monitor beeps three times.]
LAM
His heart-rate's increasing.
[Altman moves to just behind the chair.]
ALTMAN
I wonder if that has something to do with the brain scan device.
LAM
I'm going to administer some more sedative.
ALTMAN
(moving to the monitor next to Khalek)
No, no, no, just a sec! Let me just make sure that there's no
interference with the lines here.
[Khalek wakes up, an angry look on his face. The monitor next to Altman
explodes, apparently delivering a shock to Altman, who shouts and falls
to the floor. Landry and Woolsey see this from the observation room and
stand up. Khalek uses his telekinetics to pull the Zat from Mitchell's
hand. He fires at Mitchell but Mitchell ducks, and the shot hits a rack
of equipment. He fires two more shots that hit Carter and Lam. While he
is firing, Mitchell shoots him twice in the chest with his pistol.
Khalek falls to the floor. Landry glares at Woolsey and rushes out of
the observation room.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry, Mitchell, Carter, and Lam are at the table. An image of Khalek
is on a computer monitor.]
MITCHELL
(pointing behind him to the image of Khalek)
I shot him twice. At point blank range.
LAM
And he appears to be healing. Very quickly.
MITCHELL
I should've emptied the clip. I don't get it, sir. How can Woolsey
not know that keeping this guy around is a bad idea?
LANDRY
He's an ass.
MITCHELL
So, what? He's risking a catastrophe just to embarrass us?
CARTER
Woolsey's a pretty straight shooter. I think he really believes this
is gonna be of benefit. We're the ones who have spent the last eight
years justifying enormous risk for the advancements we've made.
LAM
The fact is, we are recording some incredible data. Khalek's healing
ability, his advanced brain function. That scanner was still
operating when he was using his telekinetic ability, and we've been
able to isolate the areas of the brain that he was maximizing at the
time.
MITCHELL
See! I-- I think the point is, is that he has telekinetic abilities,
and he's continuing to evolve, while we sit around yammering about
it.
CARTER
All the while, he's getting closer and closer to ascending.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek is strapped into the chair once again, unconscious. The chair
is now situated on a raised platform that is making a buzzing sound.
SF's are stationed outside the door. The brain scan monitor shows large
red areas in his brain. He rouses and looks up to see Woolsey and Lam
in the observation room.]
WOOLSEY
You should know there are now fifty-thousand volts running through
that floor, sir. And a Tok'ra shield generator barring the door.
It's one way, so we can still fire bullets in there if we have to.
Finally, Doctor Lam believes your abilities can be controlled with a
dopamine inhibitor. A shunt has been inserted into the base of your
skull, and a massive dose will be automatically injected should you
try anything else.
[An IV needle is visible on his neck, taped down.]
KHALEK
(huffing dismissively)
Thanks for the warning, Richard. Or do you prefer "Dick"?
(noting Woolsey's discomfort)
No, you didn't tell me your name. Shame about Major Altman.
WOOLSEY
He's going to be fine.
KHALEK
We'll see.
WOOLSEY
Any further outbursts will not be tolerated.
KHALEK
Whatever you say, Dick.
[Khalek closes his eyes, unconcerned. Woolsey and Lam exchange looks.]
INT--LABORATORY ON P3X-584
[Daniel and Teal'c are working on reading Anubis' logs when they hear
the rings activate. They turn to see Carter walking in.]
CARTER
Hey! I heard you guys could use some help.
DANIEL
Yeah, we heard what happened. How's Major Altman?
CARTER
Oh, he's gonna be okay. The Ascendometer says Khalek's about
eighty-percent there.
TEAL'C
Ascendometer?
CARTER
Mitchell. Wish I'd thought of it. After Khalek was shot and started
to heal, it shot up another five percent or so.
DANIEL
Yeah, we're helping him. The healing process helped him to learn
another aspect of his advancement. I'll bet anything, he wanted to
get shot.
CARTER
Ya think?
DANIEL
Well, according to the research, the way it works is, the subject
gets a treatment in this machine, and certain physiological changes
are made in the brain. Then it takes some time -- weeks, months --
to adjust. The individual needs to get used to the changes, learn
how they work. It's a gradual process. And that's what the scans are
showing us. Khalek is learning to use the advancements the latest
treatment gave him. Now eventually, with enough physical evolution
and mental control, he will reach a critical stage where he will
learn to shed his physical body and exist as energy.
CARTER
Uh, I always thought there was a spiritual component to ascension.
That you had to be a good person at heart to do it.
DANIEL
Certainly, when there's an Ancient helping you. Well, obviously when
the process happens naturally, there are no rules.
CARTER
Well, if you can call this naturally.
DANIEL
Still, the Ori prove you don't have to be moral to ascend. Who
knows? Maybe it's part of a grand cosmic balance. Good and evil have
to coexist on all levels.
CARTER
Well, for now, Khalek is still mortal. I don't think he really wants
to die before he's figured it all out.
DANIEL
He's probably been hiding the full extent of his powers from us. For
all we know, he's mocking us because he knows we can't really hurt
him.
CARTER
What else have you learned?
DANIEL
Not much. I don't think this database is going to be much help
anymore. We've been through it twice now.
CARTER
Well, the reason I came is because I have an idea. Based on the data
we've collected from the scans of Khalek's brain, I'm thinking that
we can run a simulation on the DNA machine to see where it's really
going. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been done
before, right? Artificially advance a human being to ascension using
technology rather than the help of another ascended being.
DANIEL
The log is incomplete. Anubis seems to have been stopped before he
could finish his experiments.
CARTER
Let's see if it's really going where we think it is. I mean, at the
very least, maybe he had a timeframe.
INT--ISOLATION ROOM OBSERVATION AREA
[Khalek is still strapped in, with Woolsey watching. Landry enters.]
WOOLSEY
General.
LANDRY
I'm reconsidering the arrangement with the International Committee
that's keeping you here.
WOOLSEY
Then I suggest you start going through your budget. Because without
their support--
LANDRY
How can you still be convinced that this is the right course of
action?
WOOLSEY
The scans indicate his advancement has plateaued at roughly eighty
percent of potential brain activity.
LAM
That might have something to do with the dopamine inhibitor.
LANDRY
How long are we going to keep this up?
WOOLSEY
Until we find a way to counteract someone with his abilities in the
field.
LANDRY
According to your own account, the man was able to read your mind.
Doesn't that concern you?
WOOLSEY
Gravely. The fact that there are dozens of Priors with abilities
like his roaming the galaxy right now also concerns me. And the
Committee representing the free nations of this planet, General. For
the moment, in my opinion, this situation is under control.
[Khalek starts to awaken.]
LANDRY
I certainly hope that the point at which you change your mind isn't
too late.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek mentally melts a spot in the IV tube running to his neck,
causing the flow of dopamine to stop. He smiles.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Woolsey arrives at the doorway.]
WOOLSEY
You wanted to see me?
LANDRY
I'm pulling the plug. You can notify the Committee that the SGC no
longer requires their support.
WOOLSEY
(entering)
General. Khalek's condition is stable. You've taken ample security
precautions. Every minute we have to study him, record data, the
closer we get to a means of fighting the Priors. Not to mention the
possibility of solving the mysteries of our own existence.
LANDRY
The issues we face can be overwhelming at times. I can see how
someone might lose their perspective.
WOOLSEY
I haven't lost perspective, General. I recognize the importance of
this research. That's why I'm not gonna let you stand in the way.
LANDRY
(standing, angry)
Ultimately, the decision is mine! I'm having Khalek transferred back
to his stasis pod on 584, immediately. Regardless of the
consequences to this Command. Thank you.
[Landry stands in the doorway and gestures for Woolsey to leave, and he
does.]
LANDRY
(to himself)
Putz.
INT--LABORATORY ON P3X-584
[Carter has connected a laptop and other instruments to the DNA control
pedestal.]
CARTER
Just about done.
[Daniel and Teal'c walk over to see the image on the laptop. It shows
the familiar brain scan and a bar graph with five of eight bars filled
in.]
CARTER
Each of these sections represents a treatment in the machine and the
resulting advancements. You said Khalek has had five treatments?
DANIEL
Yeah, according to the log.
CARTER
(pointing at the fifth bar on the chart)
Well, then this is where he should be now on the chart.
DANIEL
Does that mean what I think it means?
CARTER
We need to report this to Landry.
DANIEL
Yeah... There's one more thing I think you should do first.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek is no longer strapped into the chair, but his hands are chained
to his body. SF's have their rifles aimed at him, and Mitchell has his
hand on the IV stand. Woolsey and Landry watch from the observation
room.]
MITCHELL
Just to give you a heads up, we're gonna keep you attached all the
way home. You try anything, you're gonna be a drooling idiot in a
couple of seconds. Corporal.
[Mitchell raises his pistol. The Corporal puts chains around Khalek's
feet. The klaxons sound. Mitchell looks up to Landry for direction.]
INT--ISOLATION ROOM OBSERVATION AREA
LANDRY
Continue.
[Landry exits.]
MITCHELL
(to Corporal)
Go ahead.
INT--GATE ROOM
[Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c arrive through the wormhole and meet Landry
at the bottom of the ramp.]
LANDRY
We were just preparing to send Khalek through, to place him back in
stasis.
DANIEL
Bad idea. 584 is the last place we should be taking him right now.
In fact, it was probably what he was hoping for.
[Landry rushes to the intercom unit on the wall and activates it.]
LANDRY
This is General Landry. Belay the order. Re-secure the prisoner.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek is standing; Mitchell is between him and the door, holding his
gun and the IV stand.]
MITCHELL
Back in the seat.
[Khalek turns and walks back toward the chair.]
INT--GATE ROOM
LANDRY
Now explain why I just did that.
CARTER
The reason his advancement has plateaued is not because of the
dopamine inhibitor.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[An airman re-activates the brain scanner on Khalek, who is seated in
the chair again. Khalek is able to hear those in the gate room
speaking.]
INT--GATE ROOM
DANIEL
He's gone as far as he can. Now, he may have learned to use the
physical advancements he now has, but he'll never be able to ascend
in his current state. He needs more treatments from that machine to
make it happen.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Mitchell leaves the room and opens a control box in the hallway
outside.]
MITCHELL
(calling inside)
Get clear!
[The two SF's leave the room. Mitchell throws a large switch to
energize the charged floor, then an SF activates the shield generator
using a small Tok'ra switch on the wall.]
DANIEL
(via Khalek's hearing)
The one place we can't send him to is the lab on that planet. I'll
bet he's been waiting for us to try.
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ISOLATION ROOM ONE
MITCHELL
(into a phone)
This is Mitchell. Tell General Landry the prisoner is secure.
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Khalek is concentrating hard. His brain activity spikes, setting off
alarms on the monitoring equipment. Woolsey looks up in concern. Khalek
looks over to the door and mentally pulls the two SF's through the
shield generator. They fall onto the electrified floor. One begins
firing his machine gun by accident as he's being electrocuted, and some
bullets hit the bulletproof window protecting Woolsey. The IV machine
reads that it is pumping dopamine into Khalek, but since he has melted
the tubing, it doesn't get to him. He rips the arm restraints and all
of the monitoring and IV equipment off of his body. Mitchell shuts down
the electrified floor from outside and aims his pistol from the
doorway. Khalek mentally shoves Mitchell into the wall across the hall
and he drops to the floor, unconscious. Khalek removes his foot
restraints and stands. Two more SF's try to fire from the doorway, and
he launches them into the far wall as well. He walks up to the shield
and deactivates it with a touch from his hand. He looks up at Woolsey.]
KHALEK
Seems things are no longer in control, Dick.
[Khalek makes his way down the corridor, leaving Mitchell and the two
SF's unconscious on the floor.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ISOLATION ROOM ONE
[Some time later, Daniel and Carter arrive to find Lam and other
medical personnel caring for the injured. Lam is with Mitchell. The
klaxons are sounding.]
DANIEL
(rushing to Mitchell)
You okay?
MITCHELL
Yeah, I'm fine. Just help me up.
[Daniel and Carter help Mitchell stand up, but he staggers and nearly
falls while Lam tries to care for him. He leans against the wall,
Daniel supporting him by the arm.]
LAM
No you're not. You have a concussion. You need to stay put!
MITCHELL
Ah look, my head can wait. We'd just finished securing him. He went
nuts and killed two SF's.
CARTER
You think he could have heard us?
DANIEL
He'll go for the gate room.
[Mitchell starts to go in the wrong direction.]
DANIEL
(redirecting him bodily)
Gate room!
[The three head off down the corridor, followed by other SF's.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Many SF's run down the corridor.]
SF
Go! Go!
INT--VARIOUS OTHER CORRIDORS
[SF's run toward the gate room from many directions. Behind them, doors
fall into place to seal the areas off.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry and Harriman are monitoring the situation.]
HARRIMAN
Levels 12 through 28 are now secure. Full emergency contingent is in
position and on high alert.
[They view a sequence of video feeds from various corridors. One shows
a man walking alone, then the next one flashes up.]
LANDRY
(pointing)
There!
[Harriman reverses to the previous camera image. It is clearly Khalek.]
HARRIMAN
(into intercom)
Target is on Level 21. Hallway B. Heading north.
INT--LEVEL 24 CORRIDOR
[Khalek comes upon four SF's, all of whom begin firing on him with
machine guns. He deflects the bullets with his mind and hands. The SF's
stop firing. He pushes them all backward with his mind, and they hit
the walls or floor.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Mitchell, Carter, Daniel and two SF's run down the corridor.]
INT--LEVEL 24 CORRIDOR
[Khalek locates large power cables and pulls two of them from their
connectors. He touches the ends together, causing the lights to flicker
all over the base including in the control room. The lights fail,
leaving only red rotating emergency beacons.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Mitchell, Carter, Daniel and two SF's pause for a moment, then
continue.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
HARRIMAN
Security systems down. We've gone to emergency power!
LANDRY
Damn.
INT--LEVEL 21 CORRIDOR
[Khalek walks toward a closed door. He opens it with his mind and walks
through.]
INT--LEVEL 24 CORRIDOR
[Teal'c leads two SF's in a search. Khalek approaches him from behind.
Teal'c turns, sees him, and begins firing, but Khalek telekinetically
pushes him into the SF's, and they all fall to the ground. Khalek
continues on. Mitchell and the others come upon them, and Mitchell
helps Teal'c up.]
TEAL'C
(indicating)
He went that way.
CARTER
(into radio)
Medical team to Level 24, Hallway D!
[Mitchell, Daniel, Carter and one SF rush down the corridor to find an
exit tube door open. Mitchell stops and starts to climb in.]
MITCHELL
Meet me at the gate, and call this in.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Target is headed down Emergency Exit Tube 3!
INT--LEVEL 28 CORRIDOR
[Two SF's guard the Emergency Exit Tube door. It bursts open off of its
hinges, shoving them into the wall, and they drop. Khalek exits the
tube to find six more SF's aiming at him from down the corridor. He
smiles and tilts his head downward.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Landry and the others hear firing and men screaming from outside the
closed gateroom door.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[The door slides open, and Khalek enters. The SF's are visible on the
floor behind him. He closes the door behind him, again with his mind.
He walks to the base of the ramp.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
LANDRY
Get those doors open!
HARRIMAN
I'm trying, sir. The controls are not working. They're sealed shut.
[Carter and Daniel arrive in the control room. Khalek looks up at them
and takes control of Harriman's keyboard. The gate begins dialing, with
a destination of P3X-584. The chevrons begin to spin and lock.]
LANDRY
Halt the dialing program!
HARRIMAN
I can't, sir!
INT--LEVEL 28 CORRIDOR, AT DOOR LEADING TO GATE ROOM
[Mitchell tries to open the gate twice with his key card, but it has no
effect. SF's arrive.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The wormhole activates. Khalek looks up at the control room, at
Daniel.]
KHALEK
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
[He enters the wormhole, and it deactivates.]
CARTER
(seated at a terminal)
He's locked us out of the system.
HARRIMAN
Iris control is still down, too!
[The gate begins to spin again.]
HARRIMAN
Incoming wormhole.
CARTER
Cutting auxiliary power to the blast doors.
INT--LEVEL 28 CORRIDOR, AT DOOR LEADING TO GATE ROOM
[The door seal loosens as Carter's voice comes over the speakers.]
CARTER
Cameron! The electronic locks are down. You should be able to pry
the doors open.
[Mitchell and the SF's start pulling the door open, but it barely
moves. Teal'c rushes up holding a crow bar.]
MITCHELL
Yeah! That's easy for you to say!
[Teal'c arrives with a crowbar.]
MITCHELL
What took you so long?
[With Teal'c pushing, the door begins to move.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[The incoming wormhole activates.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel sees the wormhole and runs out of the control room.]
HARRIMAN
Iris will not close!
INT--GATE ROOM
[Khalek steps through from the wormhole. He looks shocked. Mitchell
enters from the partially open door and fires three times with his
pistol. Khalek stops all of the bullets in mid-air and they fall to the
ground. Khalek looks down at his chest to see blood pouring from two
wounds. Daniel has fired those shots and is standing on the other side
of the ramp.]
MITCHELL
Nice shot.
[Khalek seems to recover a bit, so Daniel and Mitchell start firing on
him with their pistols. As he steps backward, unable to stop the
bullets, Daniel and Mitchell pursue him up the ramp, firing together.
They finally stop, and Khalek smiles slightly then falls over backward
onto the floor beneath the ramp. Daniel and Mitchell look down at him.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Carter sighs in relief.]
CARTER
I rigged the call forwarding device on 584 to dial back here.
LANDRY
And you didn't tell me?
CARTER
We were going to, sir, but we didn't get a chance. It's a good thing
too, or he would have heard us.
LANDRY
(into microphone)
Medical teams to Level 28. Base is secured.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--LEVEL 28 CORRIDOR NEAR ELEVATOR
[Daniel enters his card into the reader to call the elevator. Woolsey
approaches him.]
WOOLSEY
Doctor Jackson!
[Daniel turns to see who it is. Upon recognizing Woolsey, he rolls his
eyes and exhales in disgust, turning to face the elevator doors.]
WOOLSEY
I just wanted you to know... The men who died? I'm going to see to
it personally that their families are well taken care of.
[Daniel steels himself and turns around to face Woolsey.]
DANIEL
Look, for what it's worth, I understand how you felt and why you
took the position you did.
WOOLSEY
It almost sounds like your might find it in yourself to forgive me.
DANIEL
No.
(after a pause)
That doesn't mean we don't all want what you're looking for. And the
answers are still out there.
WOOLSEY
But you were right about the risks.
[Daniel smiles ruefully. The elevator opens and he steps into it, then
turns to face Woolsey.]
DANIEL
Believe me. I wish I'd been wrong.
[Woolsey nods, and the door closes between them.]
WOOLSEY
(regretfully)
Me, too.
FADE OUT
