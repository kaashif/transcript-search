TEASER
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 are seating in the room along with General Hammond; Daniel is on
his feet giving a presentation on a projection screen.]
DANIEL
When we found Ernest Littlefield on PB2-908, we also discovered a
repository of information.
O'NEILL
Meaning of life sort of stuff.
[The projection screen displays pictures of the four languages from
Ernest's planet.]
DANIEL
Yes, based on the four distinct alien languages inscribed in the
wall, we concluded it was some sort of meeting place, where these
four races would...
HAMMOND
We all re-read the mission reports, Doctor Jackson.
DANIEL
Okay, right. Well, two days ago the probe sent back this image from
P3R-272.
[Daniel points to an image on a computer monitor. Close-up on monitor
of a circle of symbols.]
DANIEL
Now if you look closely, you'll see that the symbols match one of
the inscriptions from the meeting place on Ernest's planet.
[Daniel is excited, and looks around the table at everyone, but not
everyone is as enthused as he.]
DANIEL
So you realize what this means?
HAMMOND
You know what the circle of symbols says?
DANIEL
No, I don't-I don't even know what it sounds like, but based on the
Norse rune at the bottom of this inscription...
(Daniel points to a Norse rune)
...I'm positive that one of the four races in the alliance is Thor's
race, the Asgard. Obviously, that would make the aliens that belong
to this language their allies.
TEAL'C
(smiling slightly)
I do believe this world is worth exploring Daniel Jackson.
[Close-up on the other team members as they seem intrigued as well.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL SHOT
INT--PLANET DESIGNATE P3R-272--GATE ROOM
[SG-1 emerge in a small, empty room, with seemingly no exits. They look
around the room.]
CARTER
Very strange. Breathable air, moderate temperature, but where's the
life support coming from?
[O'Neill bangs the wall, then shakes off the pain after having hurt
himself, mouthing "ow".]
O'NEILL
Walls are solid.
TEAL'C
As the probe indicated, there appears to be no exit.
O'NEILL
Well, this was an intergalactic waste of time.
CARTER
Well, wait a minute, Sir. Where's the power for the lights coming
from? What's the point of this place?
DANIEL
Hello! Hello! I'm Daniel Jackson, we're peaceful explorers from the
planet Earth.
[O'Neill gives Daniel a questioning look.]
DANIEL
(To O'Neill)
It was worth a try.
O'NEILL
Daniel, how long you figure we oughta hang out here and scratch our
cosmic heads?
DANIEL
Well, we can't just give up.
O'NEILL
Why not?
(He pauses a moment)
Let's go home.
[O'Neill walks across a circle of writing embedded into the floor. A
shrill noise is heard and an alien device materializes and juts out
from the opposite wall as the team turn to see what it is. O'Neill
looks at it warily.]
O'NEILL
Okay, that's something.
[It has what appears to be a viewing hole. Teal'c walks up to the
device and looks into it.]
O'NEILL
Watch yourself there, Teal'c.
DANIEL
What do you see?
TEAL'C
Blackness, filled with coloured lights.
[O'Neill is right behind him and puts a hand on Teal'c's shoulder.
Teal'c walks away from the device and O'Neill approaches it. Putting a
hand on either side of the device, he peers in. Lights flicker around
inside and suddenly the device itself changes shape, popping out
further from the wall. It startles O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
[O'Neill eyes it warily, then the device morphs again, reaching out to
grab O'Neill's head and hold him in place. He struggles to get free as
the team looks on startled. Through the viewing hole, he sees lights,
and there's a buzzing sound. He cries out, and the machine suddenly
releases him. He falls to the floor and the device returns to its
inactive state. Daniel, Carter and Teal'c rush to his side.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[O'Neill is lying on the ground, eyes opened but seeing nothing.]
DANIEL
Jack, can you hear me?
CARTER
(Feeling his neck)
His pulse is racing. Daniel, dial the Gate.
[Closing on O'Neill lying on the floor as Daniel is heard dialing the
Gate.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[Close up from O'Neill's PoV of Fraiser checking his pupils.]
FRAISER
Pupils are back to normal.
(She puts her hand to his wrist)
Pulse is fine. You feel okay?
O'NEILL
Great, don't remember a thing.
CARTER
You were catatonic for about an hour after that thing released your
head.
FRAISER
Physically, I can't find anything wrong with you.
O'NEILL
(Brightly)
Well, okey-dokey.
[O'Neill swings off of the bed and leaves the infirmary, as Carter and
Fraiser watch, trading concerned looks.]
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 and General Hammond are seated around the conference table.
O'Neill is drawing some sort of device on his pad.]
HAMMOND
So what caused this device to appear?
DANIEL
We're not sure.
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill passed through the circle on the floor just before
the device appeared. I was the first to look into it.
HAMMOND
What did you see?
O'NEILL
Lights. He saw lights. That's what he said he saw--lights. We done?
HAMMOND
(A little put off)
Not exactly. Why didn't the device react to Teal'c the same way as
it did to you?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
TEAL'C
Perhaps because I am a Jaffa.
CARTER
We've seen alien technologies that have been sensitive to the
presence of a Goa'uld before, like Thor's Hammer.
O'NEILL
(A bit irritably)
Teal'c looked. I looked. It grabbed my head. I passed out. I came
to. We're here. We're home. Can we go?
CARTER
Sir, are you okay?
O'NEILL
(He pauses, then pleasantly)
I'm fine, just fine. Little tired maybe.
HAMMOND
Colonel, are you sure you're okay?
O'NEILL
(Determinedly)
I am absolutely fine. There is nothing cruvus with me.
[They all look at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
(He notices their looks)
What?
DANIEL
(Uncertainly)
You just said there's nothing 'cruvus' with you.
O'NEILL
I did not.
DANIEL
Yes, you did.
O'NEILL
No, I didn't.
DANIEL
Yes, you did.
O'NEILL
Didn't.
DANIEL
Did.
O'NEILL
Didn't.
DANIEL
Did.
O'NEILL
Cruvus, what is that?
DANIEL
I don't know. Um...well, I'm guessing in the context of what you're
saying you were trying to say that there's nothing wrong with you.
HAMMOND
Why don't you take some time to relax, Colonel. You're dismissed,
but do me a favour and stay on the base.
[O'Neill looks at all of them, then methodically tears off the sheet of
paper he's been drawing on, folds it, rises from his chair and leaves
the room.]
HAMMOND
(To the others)
Keep an eye on him.
[Teal'c and Carter nod slightly.]
INT--SGC--EXERCISE ROOM
[Teal'c stands in sweats, sneakers and boxing gloves. O'Neill is also
in the room. He is dressed in similar attire, but he's wearing
protective groin and head gear.]
TEAL'C
What is the reason for these padded gloves, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
So we don't hurt each other.
[Teal'c stares at him unconvinced.]
O'NEILL
I'll be honest with you, Teal'c, it's so you don't hurt me.
TEAL'C
If our purpose is to not cause each other harm, why, then, are we
doing battle?
O'NEILL
What can I tell ya, it's boxing. It's fun. Come on.
[O'Neill starts dancing around. Teal'c stands still and watches him as
if he's lost his mind. O'Neill slows down seeing that Teal'c is not
getting into this.]
O'NEILL
Come on Teal'c, you've got to move around a little bit. You've got
to dance.
[O'Neill starts bouncing around again.]
TEAL'C
I do not understand O'Neill. Are we preparing to dance or to do
battle?
O'NEILL
(Stopping again)
Teal'c, if you don't move around, you're a sittin' duck. You're a
target. Whoo!
[O'Neill hits Teal'c in the chest, then dances some more.]
O'NEILL
Huh? Like that.
[Teal'c looks down at his chest then back up at O'Neill. O'Neill stops
moving and moves in closer to Teal'c, apologetic.]
O'NEILL
I'm sorry. You all right?
TEAL'C
I am fine.
O'NEILL
Well, that's why you've got to move...
[Teal'c punches O'Neill in the nose. O'Neill falls to the floor holding
his face, somewhat surprised.]
TEAL'C
How was that, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
(Brightly)
It's good, that was good.
[He rises to his feet, touching his nose.]
O'NEILL
Uh, the thing about keeping your hands up...
(He touches his nose again)
Is my nose bleeding?
TEAL'C
You are fine.
[O'Neill starts bouncing around again.]
O'NEILL
Keep your hands up. You got to keep moving your...your feet moving
and, uh, bend your cozars. Keep your cozars bent.
TEAL'C
I am unfamiliar with that word.
O'NEILL
(Stopping again)
What? Cozars?
[Teal'c tilts his head at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Cozars.
[O'Neill bends his knees slightly a few times.]
O'NEILL
You got to bend your cozars.
TEAL'C
I believe you are referring to your legs, O'Neill.
[O'Neill realises what he said. He looks down at his legs that back up
at Teal'c helplessly.]
INT--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE
[Daniel is pulling some papers out of a book, then goes to sit at his
desk. O'Neill and Teal'c burst into the office. Daniel looks at them.]
O'NEILL
(Striding to his desk)
All right, what the hell is going on with me?
[Daniel looks at Teal'c then back at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
What do you mean?
O'NEILL
Well, apparently I have lost the falatus to speak properly.
[Teal'c looks at O'Neill. O'Neill sees that he said something else.]
O'NEILL
That wasn't a joke, I didn't do that on purpose.
[Daniel looks at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Several times now Colonel O'Neill has used strange words in place of
common terms.
DANIEL
(To O'Neill)
Okay, wh-what was that word you just used?
[O'Neill holds out a hand in invitation to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
I believe it was falatus.
DANIEL
Okay, sounds kinda close to Medieval Latin.
[Daniel rises from his desk and goes over to another table and brings
back a book to his desk.]
DANIEL
So, possibly a derivation, maybe even a root.
[He looks up the word.]
DANIEL
"Faculatus" is Latin for ability; you said you've 'lost the falatus
to speak properly'.
[O'Neill looks at the monitor where the circle with the alien language
is displayed, O'Neill reads.]
O'NEILL
"Noo ani anqueetas."
[Daniel looks up at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
"Noo ani anqueetas. Hic qua videeum."
[Daniel goes over to the monitor and then looks back at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Jack, are you reading this?
[He points to the monitor screen.]
O'NEILL
(irritably)
I don't know, you tell me.
DANIEL
Well, I...I don't know, I haven't even been able to associate sounds
to the symbols. Do you know what this means?
O'NEILL
(rubbing his eyes)
No! I'm just looking at it and the words just pop right into my
fron.
[Daniel just stares at him. O'Neill shakes his head wearily.]
O'NEILL
Does anybody think this is odd?
[Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill exchange glances.]
INT--SGC--CORRIDOR
[Daniel and Carter are walking. Daniel has a very large,
antique-looking book in his arm.]
DANIEL
The language he's speaking has similar sounds to Medieval Latin but
it's still quite different.
CARTER
So he's in the infirmary now?
[They enter Daniel's office.]
DANIEL
Yes, but before we took him there, he picked up a chalk and did this
in about thirty seconds flat.
[He shows Carter a blackboard full of numbers and unfamiliar symbols.]
DANIEL
Do you have any idea what this means?
[Carter stares at it.]
CARTER
No. I mean, even the simple equations don't make any sense. No, this
is like no math I've every seen.
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[A monitor displays several PET scans of O'Neill's brain. Dr Fraiser is
at the computer while Daniel and Carter stand behind her looking at the
images she's displaying.]
FRAISER
A normal human brain operates at 5-10% of its functional capacity at
any given time.
[Pan from a normal brain with green and yellows and reds to the lower
image which show the brain almost entirely in red and orange.]
FRAISER
Colonel O'Neill's brain is working at over 90% capacity.
CARTER
How is that possible?
FRAISER
I don't know.
[Teal'c enters.]
TEAL'C
Where is Colonel O'Neill?
FRAISER
Well, he should be in the infirmary.
TEAL'C
He is not there.
INT--SGC--CORRIDOR
[SG-1 are searching for O'Neill.]
CARTER
Teal'c, you take the Gate Room.
DANIEL
I'll check the locker room.
CARTER
Right.
[They split up.]
INT--SGC--WEAPONS ROOM
[Carter enters one of the rooms on the base to find O'Neill taking
apart a staff weapon.]
CARTER
Colonel. What are you doing?
O'NEILL
I need this.
[He holds up a capsule of glowing green liquid naqahdah from the staff
weapon]
CARTER
What for?
[He studies it for a moment.]
O'NEILL
I have no idea.
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, Fraiser, Daniel and Carter are standing.]
HAMMOND
Where is he now?
CARTER
He's with Teal'c.
HAMMOND
Do you think his current condition poses any threat?
FRAISER
Sir, I don't even know what's wrong with him. All I can tell you is
that his brain function has increased tenfold.
DANIEL
Jack was able to read the alien language--both the inscription from
the wall, the meeting place on Ernest's planet, and the circle of
symbols from '272 where this happened to him.
HAMMOND
What does it mean?
DANIEL
Uh, w-well, my translation's a little bit vague, um, I think the
circle means 'the place of our legacy'. Um...
(hurriedly)
...or it could be 'a piece of our leg', but the first seems to make
more sense.
(sheepish)
CARTER
The point is Colonel O'Neill is unwillingly speaking an alien
language.
DANIEL
We know the Asgard oppose the Goa'uld so it's possible all the
members of this four-race alliance felt the same.
CARTER
Which might explain why the viewer locked out Teal'c.
HAMMOND
What are you saying?
DANIEL
What if this device somehow downloaded an alien language into Jack's
brain.
[Teal'c enters.]
TEAL'C
(To Hammond)
Your presence is required in the control room.
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill is working on a computer. Cut to Teal'c leading the Hammond,
Carter, Daniel and Fraiser down the stairs.]
HAMMOND
(To Teal'c)
What's he doing?
[They all cross the room to where O'Neill is busily typing away.]
TEAL'C
I do not know.
[Carter heads straight for a computer.]
HAMMOND
Captain Carter?
CARTER
Main system's down, Sir. I'm locked out.
HAMMOND
Colonel.
O'NEILL
(Typing)
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
What are you doing?
O'NEILL
I don't know, Sir. You know me and computers.
HAMMOND
Colonel, I'm ordering you to stop.
O'NEILL
I'd love to, Sir, but I can't.
HAMMOND
(To Teal'c)
Stop him.
[Teal'c pulls O'Neill away from the computer.]
O'NEILL
No! No, not yet! I'm not fargus!
DANIEL
Sir, I think he wants to finish what he's doing.
CARTER
I can't reboot, Sir.
[All the computers switch off.]
CARTER
Uh-oh.
HAMMOND
Captain?
[The numbers O'Neill entered come up on the computer screen.]
CARTER
Sir, this is machine code. The numbers the Colonel was entering
must've been some been some sort of program.
[O'Neill enters a few more numbers, but is pulled back quickly by
Teal'c. He sighs in frustration.]
CARTER
(To O'Neill)
What did you do?
[O'Neill holds out his hands helplessly and shakes his head.]
[Carter looks back at the monitor. A star field appears and symbols
start popping up all over the screen.]
CARTER
It's the destination map. These are all the Stargates we've been
through.
DANIEL
Sam, are those new Gates popping up?
[New symbols of a different color start populating the screen.]
CARTER
That's not possible. It takes days to calculate the planetary shift
of each new location.
[A new list pops into view and Gate addresses star scrolling up the
screen.]
CARTER
Whoa, wait a second.
[The monitor then pops up a message: "No Match with Abydos Cartouche."]
CARTER
Sir, the new Stargates did not come from the Abydos cartouche data
that we put in.
HAMMOND
But that's the only reference we have, isn't it?
CARTER
The Colonel must've input new Stargate locations into the computer.
DANIEL
(To O'Neill)
Well, I guess that thing must've downloaded more that a language
into your brain. That circular inscription read 'the place of our
legacy'. What if that thing you looked into was some sort of alien
database, like the one we found on Ernest's planet, all the
knowledge that these particular aliens possessed?
HAMMOND
Colonel, you are not under arrest, but you are also not to touch
anything else on this base without permission. Understood?
[O'Neill stares painfully at the screen for a few moments.]
O'NEILL
Eetium, Sir.
INT--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is writing on a small note pad. Carter enters.]
CARTER
You can only stare at a computer screen for so long. Colonel, that
program you entered re-wrote massive amounts of the machine code.
[O'Neill throws out a helpless hand, but doesn't respond.]
DANIEL
Jack seems to have completely lost the ability to speak anything but
the alien language.
CARTER
Really? Wow.
DANIEL
But the good news is we seem to have more of the alien inscription
translated. 'Noo ani anqueetus'--'We are the Ancients'.
CARTER
Who are the Ancients?
DANIEL
Well, I think they could be the teachers of roads. See, the Romans
were the first real road builders. They spoke Latin and they learned
to build roads from the gods, known as the Ancient ones.
CARTER
I'm still not following you.
DANIEL
Roads. Stargates. The Gate builders. What if these Ancients were the
alien race who invented the Stargate?
CARTER
You're still just speculating, right?
DANIEL
Well, that would certainly explain why Jack knew about Stargates
that the Goa'uld haven't even discovered yet.
CARTER
I don't know, Daniel. Why would they invent a device that would do
this?
DANIEL
'The place of our legacy', to pass on their knowledge. Jack may have
the knowledge of the original Gate builders downloaded into his
brain.
O'NEILL
Ego indeo navo locas.
DANIEL
Okay, ego means 'I'.
O'NEILL
Indeo.
DANIEL
Need.
O'NEILL
Navo.
DANIEL
New.
O'NEILL
Locas.
[Daniel looks the word up.]
DANIEL
(Muttering)
Locas, locas, locas. Locatia. Location. You need a new location. You
need a new location?
CARTER
Where do ya wanna go?
[O'Neill doesn't seem to know.]
CARTER
Okay, good luck you guys, I've got to get back to the computer.
[She turns then indicates the blackboard with the math equations on
it.]
CARTER
Sir, I really wish you could explain all this.
[O'Neill hands her the notepad he'd been writing on.]
CARTER
'Ten equals eight'...
(Mutters)
Ten equals eight, ten equals eight...
[She picks up chalk and adds to O'Neill's work.]
CARTER
Ten equals eight. Sir, this is base eight math!
[He just looks at her like it means nothing to him. Daniel looks at
O'Neill, very concerned.]
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is displaying more PET scans on the computer monitor. Daniel
and O'Neill are there. O'Neill is seated slumped over a table, his head
rested on his crossed arms.]
FRAISER
The problem may only be affecting the verbal language centre of your
brain. It's a different function than writing, but it looks like the
problem is advancing. Since he lost the ability to speak gradually,
I think whatever is affected him may be taking over incrementally.
DANIEL
Well, what's the worst-case scenario?
FRAISER
Well, your computer analogy is pretty good. Colonel, your hard drive
has been filled with information that is written in a language your
computer doesn't understand. If it continues to progress the way it
has thus far, you may eventually lose the ability to write or even
comprehend us. Or, worse, the computer could shut down all together.
[O'Neill shakes his head.]
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, Carter, O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c are gathered.]
CARTER
Sir, we've been sending probes to the addresses Colonel O'Neill
entered into the computer, hoping that one would lead us to the race
that affected his mind. We think we may have found something.
DANIEL
P9Q-281 has a pedestal near the Gate with symbols on it that match
the alien language that O'Neill is speaking.
HAMMOND
Then I suggest we check it out. You're authorized to go, Captain.
Major Castleman will be joining SG-1 on this mission.
DANIEL
Well, if Jack's not going, then I have to stay.
HAMMOND
Why is that, Doctor?
DANIEL
Well, if-if Sam and Teal'c make contact with the Ancients, and they
can report back and...and then Jack and I will go, but until then, I
mean, translating this language may be the most important thing
we've done since we opened the Stargate.
(Hammond looks at him)
You see, I'm pretty sure that Jack is speaking the language of the
original Gate builders. At the very least, I'm positive that it's
one of the races that created the repository of information on
Ernest's planet...the, uh...meaning of life stuff.
CARTER
And, Sir, I believe that the equation Colonel O'Neill wrote on the
blackboard is a revolutionary formula for calculating the distance
between planetary bodies.
DANIEL
And bottom-line, Sir, what about Jack? I mean, right now I'm
possibly his only hope for communicating on any kind of serious
level. I can't leave him like this, and I won't.
HAMMOND
(Nodding)
All right. The rest of you will leave at 1600 hours.
INT--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM
[The Stargate engages as klaxons sound. Carter, Teal'c, Castleman and
another soldier await orders to leave.]
HAMMOND
(over P.A.)
SG-1, your mission is a go.
[The team starts up the ramp as O'Neill and Hammond watch them leave.]
INT--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE
[Daniel is seated at his desk, while O'Neill paces irritably back and
forth.]
DANIEL
Okay, I think we're getting hung up on the grammar.
[O'Neill stops. He's holding his head in frustration. O'Neill grunts
and Daniel turns to him. O'Neill can only stare back. He wants
something. Daniel helplessly holds out his hands in question.
Frustrated, O'Neill stops, looks at Daniel who is waiting patiently,
then goes to the nearest computer and types on the keyboard.]
[O'Neill types, "I have to go through the Stargate!"]
DANIEL
Okay, you have to go through the Stargate. Where? Where to?
[O'Neill holds out his hands, unable to articulate an answer because he
clearly doesn't know.]
DANIEL
Back to the planet where this happened? You have to go back there?
[O'Neill shakes his head.]
INT--SGC--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is typing on a laptop. There's a knock at the
door.</blockquote>
HAMMOND
(Closing his laptop)
Come.
[Lt. Simmons enters the office.]
SIMMONS
Sir, SG-1 did not return the probe on schedule.
HAMMOND
Let's open the Gate and try to make contact.
SIMMONS
Yes, Sir.
[Hammond rises from his chair and precedes Simmons out of the office.]
INT--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM
[The wormhole establishes.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Lt. Simmons is speaking into his headset. Hammond is standing behind
him.]
SIMMONS
SG-1 this is Stargate Command. Do you read? Over.
[After a pause, he turns to Hammond.]
SIMMONS
They're responding, Sir. Video and audio.
[Carter's image appears on an overhead monitor. It's very bright and
she looks uncomfortably hot.]
CARTER
Do not send rescue team. Repeat. Do not send rescue team.
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond. We copy, Captain. Where's Major Castleman?
CARTER
He's looking for shelter, Sir. We're in a little trouble here. We
can't dial out; the DHD seized up when we tried to send the probe
back. Temperature here is increasing rapidly which probably explains
why we haven't found indigenous life forms. The probe data did not
reveal a second sun, which rose about half an hour ago. General,
we're going to get a heckuva sunburn if we stay here much longer.
HAMMOND
Can you dial in manually?
CARTER
Teal'c's attempting a manual dial now, Sir, but we can't do anything
with the wormhole open from your end.
HAMMOND
I copy that, Captain. If you're not back in one hour, we will open
the wormhole again for further communication. Good luck. SGC out.
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[O'Neill's making something using the naquadah capsule he got from the
staff weapon. It's the device he drew on his pad during the debriefing.
Daniel enters. Fraiser is watching O'Neill build this device.]
DANIEL
What's he doing now?
FRAISER
Building something. I've been taking some notes but I'm finding it a
little hard to follow.
[As O'Neill continues to tinker, Daniel takes Fraiser to one side.]
DANIEL
I have to go downstairs; Sam and Teal'c are in trouble.
FRAISER
What?
DANIEL
Just don't tell O'Neill, I think he's got enough on his mind.
[O'Neill scrubs his head uncomfortably. Fraiser looks at Daniel and
nods. He leaves and O'Neill continues to tinker.]
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
[An engineer and Sgt Siler stand near the briefing table presenting
something to Hammond.]
ENGINEER
Sir, this Mylar material added to a standard issue field tent should
provide 10-20 degrees worth of protection.
SILER
We've augmented some air coolers to work with portable generators.
DANIEL
But how are they going to get home?
ENGINEER
Well, based on Captain Carter's description of the problem, we've
been running probability tests using the function data we correlated
so far from the DHD found in Antarctica.
HAMMOND
(To Daniel)
Do you understand what he said?
DANIEL
It sounds like they have no idea.
ENGINEER
Well, actually, it's not 'no idea', Sir. Just not much of one yet.
SILER
...but we're working on it.
[The two shift awkwardly as Daniel and Hammond look at them.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter's image displays on one of the monitors.]
CARTER
Manual dial in failed, Sir. DHD is stuck mid-dial and seems to be
locking the Gate in place.
DANIEL
(To Simmons)
Are we recording this?
SIMMONS
Yes, Sir.
CARTER
By my calculations we could be facing a temperature of over 200
degrees Fahrenheit in less than four hours.
HAMMOND
Captain, we're sending through a package of heat resistant tents and
portable air coolers.
CARTER
General, I don't think you understand how hot it's going to get.
Nothing you send us will provide enough protection. We'll be dead
before the end of the day, Sir.
[Daniel and Hammond exchange glances.]
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[O'Neill is still tinkering with building the device as Fraiser looks
on. Daniel enters.]
FRAISER
I think he's finished.
DANIEL
What is it?
[O'Neill looks at the device, then turns it on. They stare at it, but
it does nothing.]
DANIEL
That's it?
[O'Neill just looks at him feebly. He has no idea.]
DANIEL
Okay, uh, well, let's, uh...let's just leave this thing for now.
Believe it or not, I have something a little more important to
discuss.
[Daniel points to the door and starts to leave. O'Neill switches off
the machine and he and Fraiser follow Daniel out of the infirmary.]
INT--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE
[Daniel leads them into his office. He's carrying a videotape in his
hand.]
DANIEL
I didn't want to tell you this before because I thought you had
enough on your mind.
[Daniel pulls out the tape and starts to load it in the VCR.]
DANIEL
Sam, Teal'c and the rest of SG-1 are in trouble; the DHD on P9Q-281
isn't working and they can't get home. To make matters worse there's
a very hot sun rising. They don't have much time.
[He puts the video in the machine and plays it.]
CARTER
(On the video)
...the rest of the symbols won't engage, the DHD is locking the Gate
in place, so we can't dial out manually. I've tried everything I
know about these things.
[Daniel pauses the video and looks to O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Look, no one else believes that you have the knowledge of the
original Gate builders in your head right now except me.
[O'Neill grabs some paper and drawing equipment and starts drawing.
Daniel and Fraiser look on.]
FRAISER
What...What's he doing?
DANIEL
I don't know.
FRAISER
Do you think this is going to help?
DANIEL
I...I don't...I really don't...know.
[O'Neill writes something on a clipboard and moves it so that they can
read it.]
DANIEL
(Reading O'Neill's note)
"Shut up and go away."
[They both move away from him and allow him to work on his own.]
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond looks out the window over the Stargate. Siler, the Engineer,
and other scientists are also in the room.]
SILER
The problem they're having is powering up the DHD and getting it to
recharge its capacitors.
ENGINEER
Removing the power source and reinstalling always rebooted the
system in the tests.
SILER
We never simulated a mid-dial lock out.
[Daniel, O'Neill and Fraiser hurriedly enter with the plans O'Neill was
drawing and his machine.]
DANIEL
(interrupting)
We have to dial in right now.
HAMMOND
What is it?
FRAISER
The Colonel has a solution.
ENGINEER
He does?
[O'Neill rolls out the plans on the table.]
DANIEL
We weren't sure what he was drawing at first but...
ENGINEER
That's the dial home device.
DANIEL
And the instructions on how to fix it. There isn't much time.
[As they leave the scientists, Daniel puts O'Neill's device on the
table.]
DANIEL
Here, you guys can, er, work on this for a while.
ENGINEER
What is it?
DANIEL
(As he's leaving)
No idea, well not 'no idea', just not much of one yet, but work on
it.
[They watch him leave.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond, Daniel, O'Neill, Fraiser and Simmons are watching the
progress of the DHD schematic on the monitor as it traverses the
wormhole.]
SIMMONS
The object has reached its destination, Sir.
[The Stargate disengages.]
HAMMOND
Now we have to hope those instructions were right.
INT--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM
[Some time later, the Stargate opens. SG-1 walk through the Gate,
seemingly shaken. Hammond smiles as Carter approaches. She looks very
sunburnt.]
HAMMOND
Glad to have you back.
CARTER
Thought our goose was quite literally cooked this time, Sir. These
plans were perfect, who came up with them?
[General Hammond looks at O'Neill, who just stands there.]
CARTER
Colonel?
[O'Neill shrugs. Teal'c approaches O'Neill solemnly.]
TEAL'C
I am sorry, O'Neill. We could not find a way to help you.
[Carter looks down regretfully.]
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[Daniel and Teal'c are looking over O'Neill's machine. O'Neill is
rubbing his head as Carter enters.]
DANIEL
Feel better?
CARTER
Much, thanks. Is this what you wanted to show me?
DANIEL
Yes, Jack built it but no one seems to be able to figure out what...
(he switches it on)
...*it* is.
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Colonel, you have no idea what it is or why you built it?
[O'Neill shakes his head, the heel of his hand buried in his left eye.
Daniel looks at him compassionately. Then the klaxons begin t osound.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Captain Carter to the control room. Captain Carter to the control
room.
[Carter leaves the room.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter heads up the steps and approaches Hammond.]
HAMMOND
(To Carter)
We were preparing to send SG-11 to the next new Stargate address
that Colonel O'Neill programmed into the computer.
SIMMONS
The Gate wouldn't dial out, the computer's frozen.
CARTER
That doesn't make any sense, we've just run a full diagnostic.
[Simmons types a command into the computer. The monitor gives an energy
output reading. Carter looks at it.]
CARTER
The Stargate's trying to draw more power than usual from the system.
INT--SGC--INFIRMARY
[O'Neill picks up his machine and hurriedly leaves the room. Daniel and
Teal'c watch him leave.]
DANIEL
(dryly)
I'm guessing we should follow him.
INT--SGC--POWER VAULT ENCLOSURE
[O'Neill opens the Gate as Teal'c and Daniel look on. O'Neill enters
the caged power vault and stares momentarily at the main breaker.
Opening the main breaker box, he begins to hook up his device to the
power system.</blockquote>
TEAL'C
(in a low voice)
Should we not attempt to stop him, Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
Wait a minute. Jack, what are you doing?
O'NEILL
Euge.
[O'Neill fastens the device to the door of the breaker box. The lights
flicker.]
DANIEL
I think that means 'good'.
[O'Neill hooks up what appear to be power cables to his device.]
DANIEL
Jack, I really don't know if this is a good thing.
O'NEILL
Euge. Euge.
DANIEL
I don't think he understands us anymore.
[O'Neill attaches one of the cables to the main board, then switches
the machine on. It hums and glows.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is looking at the power output monitor.]
CARTER
(to Hammond)
Sir, somehow the Stargate just got a huge power boost. It's drawing
ten times more power than normal.
HAMMOND
Isn't that impossible?
CARTER
Yes, Sir, the circuit should've blown.
HAMMOND
(Goes over to the phone and picks it up)
This is General Hammond. I want Sergeant Siler and a maintenance
crew to the power room immediately.
[The Stargate begins to dial outonitsown.Chevrons start to lock in
place.]
CARTER
Uh, Sir?
[Hammond comes over to her.]
CARTER
The Gate is dialing out.
HAMMOND
Where to?
CARTER
I have no way of knowing. We've completely lost control, Sir.
INT--SGC--CORRIDORS
[Various different shot of SF's dashing around the complex, brandishing
guns.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Chevrons continue to lock in.]
SIMMONS
Chevron five is encoded.
[Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c enter the control room.]
DANIEL
The device that Jack built is some sort of energy source. He just
hooked it up in the power vault.
CARTER
Well, that explains where the Gate's getting all the extra power.
HAMMOND
I would not have authorised that, Doctor Jackson.
(To Carter)
Captain, how do we stop this?
CARTER
You could have Siler pull the main breaker.
SIMMONS
Chevron six is encoded.
DANIEL
Wait. Jack has been saying that this is a good thing. Now, so far
he's done nothing bad.
HAMMOND
So far.
SIMMONS
Chevron seven...
[The seventh chevron locks in but it's not Earth's point of origin
chevron and the number 8 appears on the screen under the seventh
chevron's slot]
SIMMONS
...is encoded?
CARTER
And it's not the point of origin.
HAMMOND
What?
[O'Neill gazes out upon the Stargate, which has not activated yet.]
DANIEL
General, what if all these anomalies that have been happening to
Jack are part of some big plan?
HAMMOND
What plan?
[Daniel looks at O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Well, earlier Jack was telling me he had to go through the Gate.
Maybe everything up until now has been leading to this.
[He indicates the Stargate]
CARTER
What's it doing?
SIMMONS
Chevron *eight* is locked.
[The Stargate activates.]
SIMMONS
Wormhole is tracking...
(freaked out, then to Carter)
Captain?
CARTER
Sir, the computer indicates that the wormhole is leaving our known
network of Stargates. It's going outside of our galaxy. Far out.
[O'Neill continues to gaze out at the Stargate.]
DANIEL
That's why the Gate needed all the extra power.
HAMMOND
Hold on, I thought Stargate addresses were six points in space with
the seventh being the point of origin.
CARTER
The extra chevron must add a new distance calculation to the
existing points. It's kind of like dialing a different area code.
[O'Neill looks at Hammond and Hammond looks at O'Neill.]
HAMMOND
Now what?
[Daniel warily watches, then O'Neill starts for the door.]
HAMMOND
Colonel!
[A guard blocks his path and O'Neill stops. Hammond approaches him as
does Daniel.]
HAMMOND
(To O'Neill)
I'm just supposed to let you go?
DANIEL
He's already gone, General. I don't think we have much of a choice.
[Hammond nods to the guard, who stands aside. O'Neill leaves and
Daniel, Hammond and Teal'c follow him.]
INT--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM
[The blast doors open and O'Neill strides in. Daniel rushes in behind
him, followed by Hammond and Teal'c. O'Neill gazes out at the activate
Stargate, and Teal'c approaches him.]
TEAL'C
I will accompany you, O'Neill.
DANIEL
I really think he needs to do this alone, Teal'c.
[Teal'c watches as O'Neill walks up the ramp and stops in front of the
event horizon.]
HAMMOND
(To Daniel)
I really hope this is the right thing to do.
[Carter runs into the embarkation room.]
CARTER
Wait, without the remote code device he won't be able to get back.
HAMMOND
Without knowing where he's going and why, that could put us in
further jeopardy. I'm sorry, I can't authorize it.
[Daniel leaves Hammond's side and rushes up to O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Jack. You understand that if you do this, if you go, you might not
be able to come back.
[O'Neill shares a long look with Daniel, then goes through the Gate.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL SHOT
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Simmons is at the controls. Carter comes in and sits next to him.
Hammond, Daniel and Teal'c join them at the console.]
SIMMONS
Traveler is still on route.
[Computer then flashes "Tracking Lost". Simmons looks at Carter.]
SIMMONS
We've lost the traveler.
[Hammond looks out over the Stargate.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL SHOT
INT--ALIEN PLANET--STARGATE ROOM
[O'Neill is thrown from the wormhole and lands heavily on the floor and
rolling down the steps.]
O'NEILL
Arrgh!
[From behind a corner, an alien figure peeks out to see who's arrived.
O'Neill is lying face down on the floor as the Stargate disengages.
O'Neill looks around uncertain of his surroundings. From his vantage
point he can see two pairs of very thin, grey legs. As the camera pans
up, he recognizes the aliens as Asgard. The two Asgard regard him, as
does he them. Stiffly, he rises to his feet and gets up to see many
Asgard gathering and whispering. There are several dozen of them
standing around a long corridor. The two that were close by are still
there.]
O'NEILL
(pleadingly)
Ego...deserdi...asordo...
ASGARD #1
(In the Asgard language to the other Asgard)
He's human. From Earth.
ASGARD #2
(In the Asgard language)
But he's speaking the language of the Ancients.
O'NEILL
Comdo...asordo...
ASGARD #2
(In the Asgard language)
He wants help.
[The Asgard uses a device embedded in his hand that flickers gently. He
points the device at O'Neill. A ray of light appears from O'Neill's
forehead. It seems that the knowledge is being extracted from O'Neill.
O'Neill collapses, unconscious.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL
[Carter and Simmons are at the console as Hammond looks on.]
CARTER
I'm going to redial.
[She types in a command.]
CARTER
The computer won't accept the eighth chevron.
[The phone rings. Hammond goes to get it.]
HAMMOND
(Into the phone)
Hammond.
SIMMONS
It's Sergeant Siler, Sir. The device that's hooked to the power grid
seems to be dead.
INT--ASGARD PLANET--STARGATE
[O'Neill is coming around. He remains lying on the floor, looking
around. Then he turns and sees the two Asgard who'd helped him.]
O'NEILL
(weakly)
Hello.
[The two Asgard exchange looks while O'Neill slowly gets to his knees.]
O'NEILL
Um. Thank you.
ASGARD #1
You are welcome.
O'NEILL
You understand me?
ASGARD #2
We speak many languages.
O'NEILL
You're the Asgard. Thor's race, right?
ASGARD #1
You have heard of us?
O'NEILL
Nothing but good things.
ASGARD #2
You looked into the archive that stores all the Ancients' knowledge.
O'NEILL
Apparently.
ASGARD #2
It was not meant for you.
O'NEILL
What? This was all an accident?
ASGARD #1
Human physiology has not advanced to the point where your brain
could handle that technology.
O'NEILL
Oh. So where am I?
ASGARD #1
This is the Asgard planet, Othala, in the galaxy of Ida.
O'NEILL
Why did I come here?
ASGARD #2
The Ancients moved on from our region of space long ago, but your
sub-conscious mind used their knowledge to find us here, where you
could get help.
ASGARD #1
Very impressive.
O'NEILL
Well, you know...
ASGARD #1
We did not think your brains had advanced even that far.
O'NEILL
How is it you know so much about our brains?
ASGARD #1
We have studied your race closely.
O'NEILL
Ah. What did you learn?
ASGARD #2
That your species has great potential.
O'NEILL
Great potential, that's good.
ASGARD #1
Understand this, there was once an alliance of four great races in
the galaxy; the Asgard, the Nox...
O'NEILL
Met them.
ASGARD #1
...the Furlings...
O'NEILL
Don't know them.
ASGARD #1
...and the Ancients, the builders of the Stargates.
O'NEILL
That's a pretty heady group.
ASGARD #1
The alliance was built over many millennia. Your race has much to
prove before we may interact on that level.
[O'Neill stands up and approaches the two main Asgards; there's more
whispering from the others.]
O'NEILL
Look, you all seem to be quite wonderful...people.
(He crouches down to their level)
And I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I really, really
appreciate you getting all that stuff out of my head, but you folks
should understand that we're out there, now, and we might not be
ready for a lot of this stuff but we're doing the best we can. We
are a very curious race.
[The Asgard exchange glances, the first Asgard offers O'Neill his hand.
O'Neill looks at it and then gently takes it. Then he stands up as the
rest of the Asgard look on.]
ASGARD #2
You have already taken the first steps towards becoming the fifth
race.
[O'Neill looks out at the Asgard.]
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is still at the console. Hammond is right there, as are Daniel
and Teal'c.]
CARTER
Sir, we're going to have to shut the whole system down and reboot.
HAMMOND
Can you close the iris, if necessary?
CARTER
Apparently not.
DANIEL
That's not good.
HAMMOND
Captain, I don't care what you have to do. I want control of this
system back.
CARTER
Yes, Sir, I'm trying.
[Suddenly, the Stargate starts to dial up again. The monitor shows
"Incoming Traveler".]
CARTER
We have an incoming wormhole.
[Daniel looks at Teal'c as they wait for what happens next. The
wormhole actives. SF's stand ready in the Gate room to open fire. They
wait and in a few moments, O'Neill appears through the event horizon
and slowly starts to head down the ramp. Hammond looks at Carter in
shock, then smiles. She, in turn, appears relieved. Daniel heads out of
the control room and Teal'c follows.]
CARTER
Everything seems to be back online again, Sir, including the iris.
HAMMOND
Good work, Captain.
INT--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM
[Daniel and Teal'c are at the base of the ramp as O'Neill approaches
them. O'Neill regards them with a slight smile.]
O'NEILL
I'm back.
DANIEL
What happened?
TEAL'C
Do you still possess the knowledge of the Ancients?
O'NEILL
(sighs)
Nope. Don't remember a thing.
(to Daniel)
But you know that meaning of life stuff?
[Daniel nods slightly.]
O'NEILL
I think we're going to be all right.
[O'Neill smiles at his friends.]
