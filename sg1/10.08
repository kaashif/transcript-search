   EXT--SOL'S DINER, DAY

   [Sol's is a typical small-town-America diner on the corner of two
   streets. A few pedestrians pass by on the sidewalk, and a man comes out
   the front door to talk on his cell phone.]

   INT--SOL'S DINER

   [The diner is busy, and it seems to be lunchtime. A couple with two
   young boys sit at a table in the middle of the room. The kids are
   playing with hand-held electronic games. The father looks up as their
   waitress approaches. It is Vala, dressed in a green and yellow uniform
   with an apron, and she's wearing matching eye-shadow.]

     VALA

     Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner. I'm Val.
     (she moves her hair to reveal her nametag)
     I'll be your waitress today. Have you had a chance to look over the
     menu? Might I suggest the meatball sandwich? It's the owner's
     personal favorite.

   [Vala gestures toward the kitchen where the owner, Sal, is plating up
   the food and rings to bell to indicate an order is ready. He smiles and
   waves, then goes back to his grill.]

     MOTHER
     Sounds good.

   [Vala nods and writes it on her order pad.]

     VALA

     (to father)
     Sir?

     FATHER
     Uh, two junior meals for the kids... and I'll have the club
     sandwich.

     VALA

     (still writing)
     Okay.

     FATHER
     Oh, and can I get some extra pickles on that?

   [Two shady-looking men are checking out the diner through one of the
   windows. They look at each other and nod before heading toward the
   entrance.]

     VALA

     (cheerily)
     No problem.

     FATHER
     Thank you.

     VALA
     Waters all 'round?

     MOTHER AND FATHER
     Sure.

     VALA
     Okay.

   [Vala walks away to get them water glasses from a tray.]

     MOTHER

     (to boys)
     Okay, once the food comes that's it for the games.

   [The shady men come in the front door; the taller one pulls a gun from
   the back of his waistband.]

     GUY #1

     (shouting)
     All right, wallets and purses on the tables in front of you, now!

   [He pulls a plastic grocery bag out of his pocket and holds it out
   towards Vala. She looks over her shoulder at him, uncertain.]

     GUY #1

     Valuables in here.
     (pointing gun at Vala)
     Hey, you listenin' to me?

   [Vala backs up until she's facing him, glancing between the bag and the
   gun that is now pointed straight at her chest. Suddenly, she grabs his
   right hand and pushes it aside, then forces the arm back and twists his
   wrist which makes him loosen his grip on the gun. Vala spins around
   behind him, pulling his gun hand over his shoulder, and elbows him in
   the kidney. A blow to the base of his neck keeps him stunned long
   enough for her to get in a kick to the groin of the other robber who
   was trying to come at her from behind. When Guy #2 doubles over in
   pain, she knees him in the face and shoves him away. He lands on the
   nearest table, which breaks and dumps him to the floor. Vala grabs a
   napkin dispenser off the counter and whacks Guy #1 on the back of the
   head. He crumples to the floor, unconscious. Vala spins the revolver
   into her own hand, gunslinger style, and points it at him, just in
   case. A single saucer spins on the tile floor as Sal rushes out of the
   kitchen wielding a meat mallet. The diner's patrons look on in shock.]

     SAL

     (softly)
     What did you do?

     VALA

     (shaking her head)
     I don't know.

   OPENING CREDITS

   THREE WEEKS EARLIER

   EXT--IL FIORE BIANCO RISTORANTE ITALIANO, NIGHT, THREE WEEKS EARLIER

   [Valets bring cars in and out on the brick driveway in front of a
   swanky, glass and metal building.]

   INT--IL FIORE BIANCO RESTAURANT

   [The restaurant's ambiance is very upscale Italian. Small tables are
   covered in long white tablecloths and everything is lit by candles and
   twinkle lights. The hostess seats Vala and Daniel at a table with a
   single white rose in a vase.]

     VALA
     Thank you.

     HOSTESS

     (to Vala)
     Your menu.
     (to Daniel)
     And for you, sir.

   [Daniel and Vala begin to look over their choices on the fancy menu.
   Vala takes a moment to admire the decor.]

     VALA

     (appreciatively)
     Fancy.

     DANIEL
     Well, I know you don't get off the base much except for official
     business, so I thought I'd take you somewhere nice.

   [Daniel takes his napkin out of his glass and places it in his lap,
   then pushes the tall vase to the side of the table out of the way.]

     VALA
     Well, I don't mind telling you, I've been looking forward to this
     little date all week.

     DANIEL
     I wouldn't exactly call it a 'date'. It's--

     VALA
     Oh, I've watched enough of your television to know what a date is,
     Daniel. It's a romantic event typified by dinner, movie and/or
     karaoke and, usually, culminating in a night of...

   [She shoots him a flirty, knowing look.]

     DANIEL

     (flustered)
     O-okay, this is... this is definitely not a date. It's, it's two
     friends and coworkers out for dinner.

     VALA
     Oh. Well, I--

   [She's cut off by the arrival of their waiter.]

     WAITER
     Hi.

     VALA

     (to waiter)
     Hi.

     WAITER
     Can I start you off with a drink?

     VALA
     Absolutely.

   [Daniel looks slightly nervous at her eagerness.]

     WAITER
     Well, tonight's featured martinis are the chocolate, passion fruit,
     and shochu plum.

     VALA
     They all sound wonderful. So... one of each, then?

     DANIEL

     (jumping in)
     Yeah, I-- I think we're gonna pace ourselves. She'll do the...
     passion fruit.

   [Vala gives a playful growl.]

     DANIEL
     And, um, I'm gonna have the bottled water.

     WAITER
     Sure.

   [The waiter glances between them, amused, as he walks away. Vala and
   Daniel start talking at the same time.]

     VALA
     Uh...

     DANIEL
     Listen...

   [Both stop awkwardly.]

     VALA
     Oh.

     DANIEL
     Uh... Let me start.

     VALA
     Okay.

     DANIEL
     Um... Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you adjusting to your new
     life here, learning to trust other people and, most importantly,
     refusing the temptation to fall back on your old ways. But you have
     worked hard to make a place for yourself with us and-- and dinner
     tonight is my way of saying thank you. Thank you for... for proving
     me right when I said we could take a chance on you.

   [Vala is a pleased and a little embarrassed at the praise. She smiles
   and ducks her head.]

     VALA
     I don't know what to say.

     DANIEL

     (shakes his head)
     Just say what you were gonna say before I interrupted.

     VALA
     Okay. I need to use the bathroom.

   [Daniel deflates a bit at her response.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it's--

   [He points over his shoulder.]

     VALA
     Okay.

   [She gets up and heads toward the restrooms, giving him a playful poke
   in the cheek as she passes. Daniel laughs quietly, sighs, and clears
   his throat as he resumes looking over the menu. Meanwhile, Vala strides
   down the hallway toward the ladies' room. As she walks past a man at a
   payphone, he hangs up, spins around behind her and jams a syringe into
   her neck. She immediately groans and goes a bit limp. He pulls her arm
   around his neck and quickly starts walking her toward the front door.]

     KIDNAPPER

     (to waiter)
     She, uh, needs some fresh air.

   [The waiter looks concerned, but goes about his business. He returns to
   Daniel's table and sets down their drinks.]

     WAITER
     Your friend has taken ill.

     DANIEL

     (lifting his gaze, very concerned)
     What? Where is she?

     WAITER
     Um... she was escorted outside by another gentleman.

   [Daniel quickly drops his menu and napkin onto the table and heads for
   the door.]

   EXT--IL FIORE BIANCO, NIGHT

   [The kidnapper and his cohort manhandle a drugged Vala into the back of
   a large white sedan driven by a third man. They burn rubber out of the
   driveway just as Daniel comes racing out the door. He finds the flower
   Vala had been wearing in her hair lying on the ground and picks it up,
   clearly upset.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [Vala is strapped to a gurney with leather restraints. She awakens
   groggily and pulls at her left wrist. As she looks down, she notices a
   large Band-Aid on her upper arm. A blonde woman in a business suit
   steps toward her.]

     ATHENA
     I apologize for that. The surgery was performed in a moving car.
     They were more concerned about removing the subcutaneous transmitter
     than being gentle about it.

   [Vala looks around the room, getting her bearings. There are two men,
   an operative and Weaver, standing in front of an array of computers and
   other devices, but little else.]

     VALA

     (to Athena)
     Do I know you?

     ATHENA

     You did. A long time ago.
     (her eyes flash gold -- she is a Goa'uld)
     Qetesh, the Goa'uld that once occupied your body, was a rival of
     mine. She was a very intelligent adversary, which is why I
     eventually decided to partner with her. In retrospect, it's also the
     reason I should have been more careful about trusting her.

     VALA

     As the host to her Goa'uld, I was an unwilling participant in many
     of Qetesh's thoughtless actions, so if this is (laughs nervously)
     a revenge thing, your anger is, well, misplaced.

     ATHENA
     This isn't 'a revenge thing'.

     VALA

     (disheartened)
     Oh.

   [Athena nods to Weaver and he comes around the workbench to the other
   side of the gurney.]

     ATHENA
     This is a search for answers. My position in the Trust has afforded
     me considerable resources.

   [Weaver presses a Tok'ra memory device into Vala's temple.]

     VALA
     Ow. OW!

     ATHENA
     Ever since I heard that you joined Stargate Command, I've been
     watching and waiting for an opportunity... which finally presented
     itself tonight.

     VALA
     What exactly do you want from me?

     ATHENA
     The code. To an Ancient tablet that I helped Qetesh locate long ago.
     A treasure map of sorts. She was supposed to share it with me, but
     instead decided to keep it for herself. From what I understand, she
     was never able to decipher it. I'd like that opportunity.

     VALA

     (shrugging)
     To be honest, it doesn't ring a bell.

     ATHENA
     That's because you suppressed many of the details from your time as
     Qetesh. The full genetic memory of the Goa'uld would drive your
     inferior human mind insane. Luckily, we have this device to help us
     find what we're looking for.

   [Vala resumes looking around the room for a means of escape. Her
   attention is drawn to a metallic device that is clearly not from Earth.
   The operative manipulates its controls.]

     OPERATIVE

     (to Athena)
     This'll take a while.

     ATHENA
     I'll leave you to it, then.

   [She gives Vala one last nasty smile as she leaves. Vala is
   understandably nervous.]

   INT--SGC, LEVEL 16 CORRIDOR

   [Personnel go about their business. Daniel and General Landry converse
   as they walk purposefully through the corridors. Not much time has
   passed, because Daniel is still wearing his clothes from the
   restaurant.]

     LANDRY
     We've got the local authorities searching the area and conducting
     interviews with every possible witness. So far they've come up
     empty.

     DANIEL
     General, there's no question the Trust is behind her disappearance.
     I mean, they're the only ones with the resources capable of pulling
     something like this off.

     LANDRY
     Agreed. I've already put a call through to Agent Barrett. He's got
     his people working on it. We'll find her.

   [Daniel shakes his head in frustration as they walk past the elevator
   and continue up the hall.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [Vala moans and struggles against her bonds as images from her time as
   Qetesh's host play randomly in her mind.]

     WEAVER
     We're starting to get images from her suppressed memory.

   [Short scenes from Qetesh's life flash on the screen of a laptop: the
   throne room on P8X-412, a sarcophagus chamber, a fleet of death gliders
   passing in front of a sun. Along the left side of the screen, there are
   boxes of text in English and Ancient.]

     WEAVER

     (to Operative)
     Dial it down.

   [Vala pants and blinks rapidly as she once again becomes aware of her
   surroundings. Weaver walks around the workbench to her side.]

     WEAVER

     (conversationally)
     How're you feeling?

     VALA
     A little dizzy. A little tired. And very, very angry.

     WEAVER
     Oh, that's because the flashbacks you're experiencing are dredging
     up some long-buried emotions that may be coloring your conscious
     mind.

     VALA
     I'm gonna kill both of you in the most painful way possible.

     WEAVER

     Things'll go a lot faster if you just relax.
     (to Operative)
     Whenever you're ready.

   [The operative reactivates the memory device, and Vala groans and
   grimaces in pain.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel sits at his workbench, lights blazing and books lying open on
   top of each other. Daniel has his elbow propped on the tabletop and his
   head resting on his hand. He's presumably been working all night and
   fallen asleep where he's sitting. Mitchell walks in, startling him
   awake.]

     MITCHELL
     Jackson! Rise and shine.

     DANIEL
     What is it? Wh-- what's, what's goin' on?

   [Daniel finds his glasses and slides them on.]

     MITCHELL
     Barrett, he came through for us. Just sent over a list of suspected
     Trust safehouses. Hopefully our girl's in one of 'em.

   [Mitchell walks briskly out and Daniel hurries to catch up.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [All is as before. The operative and Weaver watch more random bits of
   Qetesh's life on the monitor: a troop of serpent guards, someone firing
   a zat.]

   EXT--TRUST WAREHOUSE TWO, DAY

   [A heavily armed and armored assault team piles out of a black SUV to
   join SG-1 outside the warehouse door.]

     LANDRY

     (over radio)
     Team One, what's your status?

   [Carter gives Mitchell the thumbs-up.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Team One is in position.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry stands at the microphone next to Harriman, who is in his usual
   seat at the control board.]

     LANDRY

     (into microphone)
     Team Two?

   EXT--ANOTHER TRUST WAREHOUSE, DAY

   [More Air Force personnel and another assault team take up their
   posts.]

     LEADER #2

     (into radio)
     Team Two in position.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY

     (into microphone)
     Team Three.

     LEADER #3

     (over radio)
     Team Three is in position.

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [The operative shuts down the memory device. Weaver once again goes to
   talk to Vala.]

     WEAVER
     You know what I think the problem is?

     VALA

     (panting)
     That I can't strangle you?

   [Weaver laughs at her bravado and leans over her.]

     WEAVER
     You're fighting the process. In the end, all you're really doing is
     delaying the inevitable. Why don't we try and keep an open mind?
     Hmm?

   [Weaver nods to the operative, who starts up the device again. Weaver
   smiles smugly as Vala grunts and writhes.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY

     (into microphone)
     All five teams are in position.

   EXT--TRUST WAREHOUSE TWO, DAY

   [Daniel and Mitchell take their places beside Teal'c and Carter, near
   the door.]

     LANDRY

     (over radio)
     You have a go.

   [Teal'c triggers a small explosive on the door lock and the teams
   prepare to storm the building.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [Weaver and the operative look up from their instruments.]

     WEAVER
     What was that? Turn it down.

   [The operative reduces the power on the memory device.]

   INT--TRUST WAREHOUSE TWO

   [The door flies open and Mitchell bursts in, followed closely by
   Teal'c, Daniel, Carter, and the assault team. Unfortunately, all they
   find is a flatbed truck with large, tarp-covered crates on it. The
   assault team fans out to secure the building just in case, but there's
   clearly nothing here.]

     MITCHELL
     Damn. Maybe they'll have better luck at the other locations.

   EXT--TRUST WAREHOUSE, DAY

   [The team blows the hangar-style door in the same manner as SG-1 did
   the normal sized one, and hurries inside.]

   INT--TRUST WAREHOUSE

   [The SGC personnel are met with automatic weapons' fire. They quickly
   take cover wherever they can -- behind crates, oil drums, a car -- and
   return fire with P-90s and zats. Men on both sides go down in the
   firefight.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [Weaver and the operative hear the gunfire and immediately react.]

     WEAVER

     (to Devon)
     Cover the door.

     OPERATIVE
     Right.

   [He grabs a handgun and moves to do so as Weaver starts undoing Vala's
   bonds. The operative fires a few shots, but is taken down by a zat
   blast. Frantic, Weaver moves to the workbench to shut down the
   equipment, but as he does so, the same airman rushes into the doorway
   and zats him. The energy runs through his body and into the memory
   device controls, shorting them out in a cloud of sparks and smoke. The
   corresponding device on Vala's head surges as well, and she regains
   awareness after a moment, though she looks confused. The Air Force
   leader moves to free her feet.]

     LEADER #2

     (to Vala)
     It's all right. We're here to help.

   [As Vala rips off the leads to the medical equipment, the airman is
   shot twice in the back. Weaver has recovered enough to get at his
   pistol, but promptly passes out on the floor.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [The Trust minions and Air Force team continue to shoot at each other.]

   INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE

   [Vala springs off the gurney, pulling the memory device out of her
   temple as she goes.]

   INT--TRUST WAREHOUSE

   [Another Trust operative is shot down as Vala makes a break for it.]

   EXT--TRUST WAREHOUSE, DAY

   [Vala crashes through a glass door onto the sidewalk. Two members of
   the assault team stationed at the larger door recognize her then turn
   their attention back to the immediate threat. As Vala gets up and
   starts to run away, a huge, fiery explosion rips through the warehouse
   and obliterates the guards. She looks around in a panic and heads off
   down the street.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1 and Landry are seated at the table in the aftermath of the
   warehouse strike.]

     CARTER
     Four out of the five safehouses we hit were empty. Only one, it
     turned out, was still in play, and that was SG-15's. We lost them
     and three members of the local team. One Trust operative survived
     the explosion with minor injuries. He confirmed that the place was
     rigged to blow in the event it was stormed. He also confirmed that
     Vala was being held at that location.

     DANIEL
     So it's possible they moved her before the place was raided.

     CARTER
     Unlikely. They wouldn't have had the time. Besides, the guy we
     caught claims he saw Vala making a run for it.

     DANIEL
     Then she could've gotten out on her own.

   [Carter nods.]

     TEAL'C
     If that were the case, why has she not yet attempted to contact us?

   [At a loss for an explanation, Daniel lets out a heavy sigh.]

   EXT--SOL'S DINER, DAY

   [Vala, looking very lost and a little cold, walks along the sidewalk
   and stops in front of the diner. She appears a bit more hopeful as she
   cautiously walks toward the door and goes in.]

   INT--SGCSGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Weaver sits handcuffed at a table. He has some scratches and bruises,
   but the worst visible wound is held together with just a few butterfly
   bandages. Daniel sits across from him. An SF stands guard in a corner,
   while Teal'c backs up Daniel. Carter and Mitchell watch from the
   observation room above.]

     DANIEL
     So, what did you want with her? I mean, what exactly was going on in
     that warehouse?

     WEAVER

     (exasperated)
     Look, I already told you...
     (to Carter and Mitchell)
     I can't say!
     (to Daniel)
     It's not that I don't wanna help you, but right now I'm more
     concerned for my well-being.

     DANIEL
     We can protect you.

     WEAVER
     No, you can't!

     DANIEL

     (cheerily)
     Okay.

   [Daniel gets up to leave.]

     DANIEL

     (to Teal'c)
     He's all yours.

   [Daniel slaps Teal'c on the shoulder and steps to the doorway. In the
   observation room, Carter and Mitchell head for the door, as well, their
   expressions regretful.]

     WEAVER

     (nervously)
     Where're you going?

     DANIEL
     I'll be out in the hall; just yell loudly if you need me.

   [The blast door slides shut. Carter and Mitchell exit the observation
   room. Teal'c walks toward Weaver, calm, silent, and menacing.]

     WEAVER
     Don't bother. Your Jaffa interrogation tactics won't work.

   [Teal'c just stares at him appraisingly and paces around the end of the
   table.]

     WEAVER

     (with false bravado)
     Believe me, I've seen some pretty horrible things in my life. You
     can't break me.

   [Weaver sets his jaw and stares straight ahead, determined to withstand
   whatever physical torture might be inflicted on him. Teal'c simply
   steps up next to his chair and leans down to whisper in his ear.
   Whatever it is Teal'c has to say obviously makes an impact. Weaver is
   horrified.]

   INT--HALLWAY OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Daniel, Carter and Mitchell stand by the door, waiting for Teal'c to
   do his thing.]

     CARTER
     A member of this facility gets kidnapped unchallenged, it's no
     wonder he doesn't think we can protect him.

     DANIEL
     But we can protect him.

     CARTER
     Yeah, by locking him away for the rest of his life.

   [Daniel nods.]

     MITCHELL
     What can you say? There's a downside to workin' for super-villains.
     Well, this is probably gonna take a while. What d'you say we grab a
     bite to eat?

   [Just then, the blast door opens and Teal'c steps out. The rest of the
   team is surprised.]

     CARTER
     You're done?

     TEAL'C
     He was surprisingly forthcoming.

   INT--SOL'S DINER, DAY

   [Vala sits at a table, finishing a meal with enthusiasm. She licks her
   fingers and then dries them with her napkin. The middle-aged waitress,
   wearing the same uniform Vala will end up donning, sees that she's done
   and slides the check onto the table.]

     WAITRESS
     Whenever you're ready, honey.

   [Vala looks around nervously. One of the people at the counter turns
   around; he has a police badge clipped to his belt. Taking a moment to
   steel herself, Vala gets up and heads calmly for the door. She's
   brought up short when Sal steps into her path, as if knowing what she
   is about to do.]

     SAL

     (friendly)
     How ya doin'?

     VALA

     (sunnily)
     How are you doing?

     SAL
     Ah, terrific. I'm Sal, the owner.

     VALA
     Sal, the owner... of Sol's Diner.

     SAL
     Yeah, Sol was the original owner. I bought the place from him.

     VALA
     Oh.

     SAL
     So, how was lunch?

     VALA
     Delicious.

     SAL

     (getting serious)
     Delicious enough to... pay for?

     VALA
     Yes. If I had the money, I would certainly have paid for that meal
     and given the lovely waitress a sizable gratuity.

   [Sal looks at her in disbelief.]

     VALA
     The service was impeccable.

     SAL
     Look, lady, everybody's got problems. I got rent on this place, a
     mortgage, a wife, three kids, and a Shih Tzu with a recurring
     gastrointestinal condition that requires a very specialized diet.
     Alright?

     VALA

     (meekly)
     Okay. I'm sorry for trying to cheat you.

   [She shrugs helplessly.]

     SAL
     O-okay, alright, look. If I let you leave, can I trust you to come
     back with the money you owe me?

     VALA
     No.

     SAL
     No? What d'you mean 'no'? You tellin' me you can't be trusted?

     VALA

     Truthfully?
     (sits against on a nearby table)
     I don't know. I-- I don't remember. I have no idea who I am, much
     less what I am capable of. All I know for certain is that, about an
     hour ago I was lost, hungry and drawn to the delightful aroma of the
     blue plate special.

     SAL

     (laughing)
     Is this a joke?

     VALA

     (very serious)
     I have absolutely no memory of my life prior to wandering in here.

     SAL

     (concerned)
     If that's true, we need to get you to a hospital.

   [Sal puts his hand around Vala's wrist, and she looks down in alarm.
   The sensation causes her to have a flashback to when Weaver and the
   operative strapped her to the gurney in the lab. She tries to pull out
   of Sal's grip.]

     VALA

     (frightened)
     No hospitals!

     SAL
     Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hang on.

   [The policeman at the counter, Detective Ryan, gets up to intervene.]

     RYAN
     Hey. Everything okay here, Sal?

     SAL
     Yeah, everything's fine.

   [Ryan doesn't look convinced.]

     SAL

     (insistent)
     Don't worry about it.

   [Ryan still looks doubtful, but he sits down and goes back to his
   newspaper.]

     VALA

     (whispering)
     Let me go.

     SAL
     Go where?

     VALA
     Please.

     SAL
     What, y-- you got a home? You got a family?

     VALA
     I don't know. I would pay you back. I would. Just right now I don't
     have the means.

   [Sal sighs, sympathetic.]

     SAL
     Maybe I can do somethin' to help ya.

   [He pats her shoulder. Vala looks at him uncertainly.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [By the light of a desk lamp, Daniel sits at his desk, contemplating
   what looks like a leather bound journal. Mitchell gets his attention
   from the door before entering.]

     MITCHELL
     Jackson. How's it goin'?

     DANIEL

     Well...
     (sighs)
     From what we learned from the Trust operative, and the information
     provided to us from the Jaffa and the Tok'ra, this is what I've been
     able to piece together so far.

   [Daniel stands and meets Mitchell at the workbench, which is strewn
   with open books, some face-up and some upside-down. He pulls out
   various tomes from the mound to illustrate his story as he tells it.]

     DANIEL
     Athena, Greek goddess of war, a.k.a. Charlotte Mayfield, a.k.a. the
     Goa'uld responsible for kidnapping Vala. Now, according to what I've
     learned, she was a minor player who rose to mid-tier status by
     pursuing alliances with more powerful rivals: Cronos, Camulus,
     Svarog, and even Anubis when he was first on the outs with the
     System Lords.

     MITCHELL
     So, her partnering up with Vala is just her latest power play?

     DANIEL
     No, it's more than that. See, we know Athena was once allied with
     Qetesh, the Goa'uld that formerly inhabited Vala. See, apparently,
     Qetesh double-crossed her when they partnered up to search for the
     Clava Thessara Infinitas...

   [Daniel plops a book in front of Mitchell. It's written in Ancient, but
   the illustration in the middle of the page shows a figure holding up a
   large stone with a shining square within it.]

     DANIEL
     ...the Key to Infinite Treasure. Now, according to legend, it would
     allow he who possesses it entry to a vast storehouse of riches
     hidden away by the Ancients prior to their ascension.

     MITCHELL
     Wow, that's big.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, and by all indications nothing but an elaborate hoax.

     MITCHELL
     So they didn't find it?

     DANIEL

     No, but for some reason Qetesh wanted Athena to think she had.
     Athena believed her, which is why she went after Vala. And she used
     Ba'al's resources here on Earth to get her.
     (realizing)
     Which reminds me, I'm supposed to check in with Major Harper.

   [Daniel walks over to his desk.]

     DANIEL
     He's got people querying hospitals in the area where Vala
     disappeared. It's possible that she may have been injured and has
     been unable to contact us.

   [Daniel puts the phone to his year.]

     MITCHELL

     (uncomfortable)
     Hey, listen, I, um... I spoke with the Medical Examiner's office.
     They're doing DNA testing on the remains recovered at the blast
     site. But it's gonna take a while.

   [Daniel puts the phone down, appearing worried.]

     DANIEL
     You know, when Vala first disappeared, when the Ori gate was
     destroyed, I refused to write her off. Although the odds were
     against it, I believed somehow she'd found a way to survive. And it
     turned out I was right. I wanna be right again.

   [Mitchell gives him a tiny, sympathetic nod.]

     MITCHELL
     Sure. I just figured you should know.

     DANIEL

     (subdued)
     Yeah. Thank you.

   [He puts the phone to his ear and dials. Mitchell turns to leave,
   contemplative.]

     DANIEL
     Major Harper, please.

   EXT--OFFICE BUILDING, DAY

   [A very tall building that looks like it was put up in the 1980s rises
   into the cityscape.]

     ATHENA

     (voiceover)
     I don't care what the so-called experts have to say.

   INT--OFFICE BUILDING

   [Athena, in her Charlotte Mayfield persona, is on the phone, a wireless
   headset hooked over one ear.]

     ATHENA
     I want you to free up the capital and move it into a company called
     Berringer Consolidated.

   [Devon, a young Trust operative in a business suit, enters her office.]

     ATHENA

     I have it on good authority that they'll be announcing a major
     breakthrough before week's end.
     (listens)
     All right.

   [She hangs up the phone and nods to her visitor.]

     DEVON
     The DNA results are in. They were able to ID twelve victims, none of
     them our girl. My guess is there wasn't enough of her left to run
     tests on.

     ATHENA
     Or there wasn't anything left because she didn't die in that
     explosion.

     DEVON
     If she got out, she would've gone straight back to Stargate Command.
     They wouldn't still be looking for her.

     ATHENA
     I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe she is dead.

   [Devon smiles slightly.]

     ATHENA
     But until we have confirmation, I want you to keep looking for her,
     too.

   [He deflates a bit, but nods in acquiescence and leaves to get back to
   his work.]

   TWO WEEKS LATER

   EXT--SOL'S DINER, DAY

   [The day is overcast. A woman hurries past.]

   INT--SOL'S DINER

   [Vala, now in her waitress uniform, goes from her customers at the
   counter to the pass-through window. She clears her throat to get Sal's
   attention.]

     VALA
     Okay. Dead cow on a turban, hold the yellow, extra spud mush.

   [She tears off the order slip and slaps it down on the pass-through.]

     SAL

     (pleased)
     Whoa-ho! Listen to you. You've been practicing. Very nice.

   [Vala curtsies playfully. As she puts her order book into her pocket,
   she's hit with a series of Qetesh flashbacks: a sarcophagus, a serpent
   guard zatting a prisoner, a ring transport beam, two Jaffa marching
   down a hallway, a Horus guard, a contingent of serpent guards. Vala
   sways on her feet.]

     SAL
     Val, you okay?

   [He rushes out of the kitchen to check on her. She snaps out of her
   trance when he touches her shoulder.]

     SAL
     Hey. You all right?

   [She nods woozily.]

     SAL
     Is it that visions thing again?

   [Another nod.]

     SAL
     Ah. Look, I told you, you should go get yourself checked out, honey.

   [Vala shakes her head vehemently.]

     VALA
     No.

   [Sal sighs in exasperation.]

     VALA
     Sal, what am I doing? Working here, sleeping out the back, watching
     reruns of The X-Files in my spare time. I appreciate everything
     you've done for me, but... I've gotta tell you, I've been thinking
     about leaving.

     SAL
     So, where you gonna go?

     VALA
     I don't know. But this isn't my life. It just doesn't feel right.

     SAL
     Trust me, sweetheart, running away isn't gonna make things better
     for you. Workin' tables here, it may not feel right, but at least
     you got a roof over your head, and some friends who care about you.

   [Vala smiles a little.]

     SAL
     May not feel like your life right now. Just give it some time, okay?

   [Vala considers it, snapping her gum.]

     VALA

     (quietly)
     Okay.

     SAL
     Good. Now, get back to work before I fire your butt.

     VALA
     Oh.

   [She scampers off to attend to her customers as Sal retreats to his
   kitchen. Meanwhile, two shady-looking men are checking out the diner
   through one of the windows. Vala steps up to a table in the middle of
   the room where a couple is sitting with their two young boys.]

     VALA

     Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner. I'm Val.
     (she moves her hair to reveal her nametag)
     I'll be you waitress today. Have you had a chance to look over the
     menu?

   [In the kitchen, Sal is frying up a couple of hamburger patties.
   Unbeknownst to him, the shady men come in the front door; the taller
   one pulls a gun from the back of his waistband.]

     GUY #1

     (shouting)
     All right, wallets and purses on the tables in front of you, now!

   [Sal turns to the prep station where he grabs a cleaver and a large
   chef's knife. Hearing the sounds of a fight, he tosses the knives onto
   the counter and grabs a large meat mallet instead, giving it a test
   swing before he rushes out into the dining room. By the time he gets
   there, Vala has subdued both robbers and is holding a gun on one of
   them. A single saucer spins on the linoleum. The diner's patrons look
   on in shock.]

     SAL

     (softly)
     What did you do?

     VALA

     (shaking her head)
     I don't know.

   INT--POLICE STATION

   [Detective Ryan sits at his desk as Vala stands nervously near the
   doorway, looking out through the glass into the office area. She has
   been brought in to give a statement about the attempted robbery at the
   diner.]

     RYAN
     Okay. Name?

     VALA
     You know my name. You're a regular at the deli.

     RYAN
     So, what, is Val short for Valerie?

     VALA
     Okay. Yes, Valerie.

   [Ryan shakes his head at her demeanor, but writes it on the form
   anyway.]

     RYAN
     Last name.

     VALA
     Todad.

   [Ryan starts to write it on the form, but hesitates. Vala snags a candy
   out of a container on the desk and plops herself in a chair, eyeing him
   nervously.]

     VALA
     Valerie Todad.

   [Noting Vala's line of site, Ryan turns to the bulletin board on his
   wall. There are photographs and hand-drawn pictures. Right in the
   middle is a child's drawing of a cat that bears the inscription 'To
   Dad'. He blinks and turns back to Vala.]

     RYAN
     Look, Val, is there any reason why you don't want me to know your
     real last name?

   [Vala shakes her head.]

     VALA

     No, of course not. I'm just... a very private person.
     (makes a face at the candy in her hand)
     Would you mind if I took a moment to freshen up?

   [She tosses the candy in the garbage and looks at him expectantly. Ryan
   considers for a moment, then picks up his mug.]

     RYAN
     Sure, I need coffee anyway.

   [They walk through the main room. Ryan stops at the coffee maker and
   points down the hallway.]

     RYAN
     Straight ahead, second door on your left.

   [Vala strides down the hall, glancing furtively at the officers all
   around. When she reaches the ladies' room, she looks back to see if
   Ryan is watching. He is. She points to the door and gives a falsely
   cheerful laugh. She grits her teeth and reaches for the door just as a
   uniformed officer is coming out.]

     VALA
     Oh. Sorry.

   [Vala hurries into the bathroom and locks the door. She goes to the
   window, obviously intending to flee, but it's covered in plexiglas and
   secured with padlocks. She leaves the bathroom. Ryan is no longer
   standing right where he can see her, so she heads down the hall away
   from the squad room. When she opens the door to the stairwell, Ryan is
   waiting for her with a disapproving look on his face.]

     VALA

     Oh. Hello.
     (falsely)
     I didn't know how long we were going to be, so I was just going out
     to get us some lunch.

   [Ryan looks at her dubiously. Vala's smile falls.]

   INT--POLICE STATION, A LITTLE LATER

   [Ryan hands a Jane Doe notice with Vala's picture and description on it
   to an officer.]

     RYAN
     Run it through the channels, see if anything comes up.

   [He goes back into his office where Vala is waiting.]

     VALA

     (pleading)
     I don't understand. I didn't do anything illegal. I didn't hurt
     anyone. Well, apart from those two fellows who, from what I
     understand, I was totally within my rights to hurt.

     RYAN
     Witnesses say you took 'em both down without even breaking a sweat.
     How'd you manage that?

     VALA
     Instinct.

     RYAN
     No, I think training. Don't suppose you wanna tell me where you
     learned those moves?

   [Vala winces, but says nothing.]

     RYAN
     That's what I thought.

   [They both sigh in frustration.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Sergeant Harriman strides down the hallway, brandishing a sheet of
   paper. He enters the office, where Landry is consulting with another
   noncom.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir.

     LANDRY
     What is it, Chief?

     HARRIMAN
     I thought you should see this.

   [He hands the paper to Landry. It's the Jane Doe notice for Vala.]

   EXT--OFFICE BUILDING, DAY

     ATHENA

     (voiceover)
     Listen to me. This is what you're going to do.

   INT--OFFICE BUILDING

   [Athena is on the phone again. Devon enters, but doesn't interrupt. He
   pulls a sheet of paper out of his portfolio and waits.]

     ATHENA

     (into phone)
     You're gonna sell all of our remaining stock in Berringer
     Consolidated. I have it on good authority that they're about to be
     rocked by a major accounting scandal that will--

   [She stops as she sees what Devon is holding up. It's the Jane Doe
   notice for Vala.]

     ATHENA

     (into phone)
     Nathan, I'm gonna have to call you back.

   INT--POLICE STATION

   [Ryan sits down at his desk, looking somewhat worried.]

     VALA
     What is it?

     RYAN
     We got a call. Apparently, some people are looking for you.

     VALA

     (sitting up straighter)
     Who?

     RYAN
     The United States Air Force. They're sending a Colonel Carter to
     pick you up.

     VALA

     (frightened)
     No.

     RYAN

     (confused)
     What do you mean, 'no'?

     VALA
     I'd rather stay here. If you need me to commit a crime, I'd be happy
     to oblige.

     RYAN
     Look, Val, I don't pretend to know what you're all about, but when
     people start throwing around words like 'national security', there's
     not a lot I can do.

     VALA

     (resigned, pleading, voice shaking)
     All right, I'll be honest with you. The reason why I can't tell you
     who I am is because I don't know. I don't remember. I-- I don't know
     where I'm from. I'm not even sure if Val is my real name. My memory
     only goes as far back as that day two weeks ago when I wandered into
     the deli for a lunch I couldn't pay for. I don't remember any of my
     life before that. Although, I do have flashbacks. Occasionally
     they're... terrifying, like something out of a horror movie. But
     they don't make much sense. I was hoping that sooner or later my
     memories would just come back, or that something would help remind
     me of who I really am, but... After what happened today, I'm not
     sure I want to know anymore.

   [Ryan's expression is unreadable, but Vala's is desperate and hopeful.]

     RYAN
     You know, Val, it'd be a lot easier if you'd just be honest with me.

   [Vala drops her head to the desk in frustration. Behind her a woman and
   a man, both in Air Force uniforms, walk through the squad room toward
   the office. The woman is forty-ish with short blonde hair. She flashes
   a badge as she enters.]

     FAKE CARTER
     I'm Colonel Carter. I'm here to take custody of the prisoner.

   [Vala's head pops up at that last word.]

     VALA
     Prisoner?

     RYAN

     (standing)
     You mind telling me what this is all about?

     FAKE CARTER
     The government has been looking for Ms. Mal Doran for a while now.

   [The other "officer" pulls out a set of handcuffs and walks around
   behind Vala's chair.]

     RYAN
     Why? What did she do?

     FAKE CARTER
     I'm sorry, Detective, that's classified.

   [The "officer" hauls Vala to her feet and snaps on the cuffs.]

     VALA

     (to Ryan)
     Don't let them take me away.

     FAKE CARTER
     We appreciate you cooperation in this matter, sir.

   [They drag Vala toward the door.]

     VALA

     No. No, no, please.
     (almost crying)
     Mr. Ryan?

   [Ryan watches uncertainly as they pull her out of the office. Through
   the window, he sees them put her into the back of a black sedan and
   drive away. He looks into his coffee cup and realizes it's empty again.
   Ryan walks into the squad room. An officer is booking a man with a
   bloody bandage on his nose. SG-1, all in civilian clothes, come up
   behind Ryan as he's getting more coffee.]

     CARTER

     Detective Ryan? Hi.
     (flashing her ID)
     I'm Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter, United States Air Force.
     We're here for the Jane Doe you've been holding.

     RYAN

     (confused)
     Another Colonel Carter just picked her up.

     DANIEL
     When?

     RYAN
     About a minute ago. Yeah, there were two of 'em. You must've passed
     them on your way in here. Black sedan, government plates?

   [SG-1 hastily turns to leave.]

     RYAN

     (calling after them)
     They were headed for the freeway.

   EXT--POLICE STATION, DAY

   [SG-1 runs toward the parking lot, but their SUV is blocked in by a
   patrol car. A couple of officers are standing near a third vehicle.]

     CARTER

     (shouting)
     We need you to move that car!

   [Mitchell motions for the rest of the team to stay where they are. He
   pulls out his ID and runs over to a man getting on a motorcycle,
   grabbing the helmet out of his hand.]

     MITCHELL
     I'm commandeering your bike. Get off.

   [Mitchell cranks up the bike and peels out of the lot, popping a
   wheelie in his haste.]

   EXT--HIGHWAY, DAY

   [Mitchell tears down the road in pursuit of the black car. He weaves in
   between vehicles and rides the lane lines, narrowly avoiding several
   collisions. He nearly catches up to the sedan, when it takes the Surrey
   exit from the highway. Mitchell follows.]

   EXT--BACK ROAD, DAY

   [The black sedan drives quickly, but its occupants don't yet appear
   aware that they're being followed. Mitchell pursues but hasn't quite
   caught up.]

   INT--BLACK SEDAN

   [Vala is in the back seat, her hands hand-cuffed in front of her. One
   operative drives, while another sits beside her. The fake Carter sits
   in the front passenger seat.]

     VALA
     Why won't you tell me where we're going?

   [The Trust operatives ignore her. Suddenly, she drives her elbow into
   the face of the man next to her, then loops the chain of her handcuffs
   around the driver's throat. He swerves wildly as he and the fake Carter
   fight to regain control of the car.]

   EXT--BACK ROAD, DAY

   [Behind the car, Mitchell is closing the distance. Vala continues
   choking the driver. As the car comes to an intersection, it flips over
   several times and skids to a stop on the grassy shoulder. Mitchell
   pulls the motorcycle to a stop in the middle of the intersection and
   gets off. He pulls a handgun out of the back of his pants and starts
   toward the car. The rear door opens and Vala stumbles out, raising her
   hands.]

     MITCHELL

     (relieved)
     You all right?

   [Seeing that Vala's still wary, he lowers his gun and holds out his
   other hand.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

   [The operative from the back seat pops up from behind the car. Mitchell
   instinctively shoots him, but the operative manages to hit him in arm
   as well. Mitchell falls to the pavement.]

     MITCHELL
     Augh! Son of a-- Mother--

   [Mitchell drops his gun beside him and grabs his injured arm. A young
   man in a beat-up blue car pulls up to the intersection. Seeing the
   smoking car, he stops and gets out. Vala grabs Mitchell's gun and
   points it at him.]

     DRIVER
     Is anybody hurt?

   [Vala points the gun at the concerned driver. He hastily puts his hands
   above his head.]

     VALA

     (calmly)
     Throw me the keys.

   [He does so.]

     VALA
     Run away.

   [The driver turns back the way he came and starts running. As she
   hurries toward the blue car, Mitchell becomes aware of what she's
   doing.]

     MITCHELL
     Vala, wait!

   [Vala cautiously walks back to Mitchell, keeping the gun pointed at
   him.]

     VALA
     What did you just call me?

     MITCHELL
     Vala.

     VALA
     Get up.

   [Mitchell hesitates, still in pain.]

     VALA
     Get up!

   [Reluctantly, he rolls to his feet. They get in the blue car, Mitchell
   in the driver's seat and Vala next to him, gun still aimed in his
   direction.]

     MITCHELL
     Where're we goin'?

     VALA
     Just drive.

     MITCHELL
     Y'know, I'm bleeding here.

     VALA
     Shut up.

   [Mitchell puts the car in gear and turns right, heading back down the
   road they came in on.]

   EXT--MOTEL, DAY

   [The blue car is parked outside a motel room.]

   INT--MOTEL ROOM

   [Mitchell is asleep on the bed wearing nothing but his underwear,
   watch, and dog tags. He's a little bruised, and there's a blood-stained
   towel under his left arm. The bullet wound appears to be a long graze.
   As he wakes up, he realizes that his right wrist is handcuffed to the
   headboard.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, boy.

   [Hearing him stir, Vala comes out of the bathroom tearing strips of
   cloth -- probably from a sheet or pillowcase -- in her hands.]

     VALA
     What are you doing?

     MITCHELL
     Checking to see if I still have both of my kidneys.

   [Vala comes to sit in the chair next to the bed.]

     MITCHELL
     Vala, what the hell's goin' on here?

     VALA
     You know me?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, of course. Why?

   [Vala begins wrapping the makeshift bandages around his wounded arm.
   Mitchell flinches.]

     MITCHELL

     Ah-ugh.
     (realizing)
     You don't remember me?

     VALA
     I don't remember much of anything. Least of all who I am, or why
     everyone is after me. That's why I brought you here. You're going to
     supply me with some much-needed answers.

   [Vala knots the bandage around his arm tightly.]

     MITCHELL
     Aaah. You know, maybe we should call the rest of the team; they're
     generally better at answers.

   [Vala just stares at him expectantly.]

     MITCHELL

     (resigned)
     Okay, here goes. Your name is Vala Mal Doran. You're a member of
     Stargate Command, a top secret facility located beneath Cheyenne
     Mountain. It's the command center for a military organization
     responsible for offworld exploration and reconnaissance by means of
     a device known as a Stargate, a portal which allows
     near-instantaneous transport between planets.

   [Vala picks up one of Mitchell's dog tags, reads it, but drops it again
   as he finishes his spiel.]

     MITCHELL
     How'm I doing so far?

     VALA
     Not good.

   [She puts another knot in the ends of his bandage.]

     MITCHELL
     I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

     VALA

     (humoring him)
     Hm. Okay. So, we're space explorers?

     MITCHELL
     Well, technically, me and my team are the explorers. You're just...
     along for the ride, because... Well, you're not originally from this
     planet; you're an alien.

   [Vala gets up, rolling her eyes, and goes to the pile of Mitchell's
   clothes near the desk. She pulls his wallet out of his pants, and sits
   back in the chair to go through it.]

     MITCHELL

     (placating)
     And I mean that in the nicest possible way! Y'know, when you say
     'alien', people think green skin, four eyes, tentacles, what have
     you, but the-- the reality is very, very different.

     VALA

     (dismissive)
     Mm-hm. I'm borrowing some more money.

     MITCHELL

     (pressing on)
     Look, take you, for example. You're human. Hell, you're more human
     than most of my neighbors, especially that guy in 304.

   [Vala pulls a handful of bills out of his wallet and heads for the
   door.]

     VALA
     I'll be back.

     MITCHELL
     Look, since you're part of the team maybe you should think about--

     VALA
     Won't be long.

     MITCHELL
     --trusting me?

   [The door slams behind her. Mitchell gives the handcuffs a futile
   shake.]

     MITCHELL
     Or uncuffing me? Or giving me my pants back?

   INT--POLICE STATION

   [Detective Ryan is interviewing the owner of the blue car Vala stole.]

     RYAN
     Okay, just wait right here. I'll be right back.

   [Ryan walks out into the squad room where Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are
   waiting.]

     RYAN
     Well, he's of no help. All he remembers was the gun, and then he was
     off to the races.

     TEAL'C
     Presumably you are searching for the missing vehicle.

     RYAN
     We got all available units looking. In the meantime, it turns out
     the deceased in that overturned sedan were all carrying phony ID.

   [Carter rolls her eyes; none of the three appear surprised.]

     RYAN

     The license plate was also bogus. As for the car itself, it was a
     company vehicle registered to a...
     (checks his notes)
     ...Forsythe Chemicals. But that's a dead end because, apparently,
     they reported the car missing this morning.

     DANIEL

     (dryly)
     Of course they did.

   [Carter's cell phone rings, and she pulls it out of her jacket.]

     CARTER

     (into phone)
     Carter.
     (listens)
     All right. Thank you.
     (hangs up)
     We got a lock on Cam's transmitter.
     (to Ryan)
     Thank you, Detective.

   [The team turns to leave.]

     RYAN
     Yeah, sure. Anytime.

   INT--MOTEL ROOM

   [Mitchell is still handcuffed to the bed but has pulled the bedspread
   up over himself. The door opens and Vala enters, carrying a paper
   grocery bag.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, I think I've figured out what happened to you, why you don't
     remember anything.

     VALA

     (sarcastically)
     Oh, good. Does it involve an alien abduction?

   [She sets the bag on the desk where it promptly tips over, spilling
   junk food in individual wrappers onto the desk. Vala plops down on the
   chair.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, in as much as that you're an alien who was abducted, yes.

   [Vala props her feet up on the desk and grabs something that looks like
   a waffle drizzled with chocolate. She opens the wrapper and starts
   eating.]

     MITCHELL
     You were undergoing a procedure which was designed to dig up some of
     your suppressed memories. The scientist that we captured told us
     that, during the procedure, the device was destroyed, which allowed
     you the opportunity to escape.

     VALA

     (dubious)
     From the aliens?

     MITCHELL
     No, they weren't aliens. Though they're working for an alien, but
     that's not really important.

     VALA

     (pausing from eating)
     Vala isn't a particularly alien name.

     MITCHELL

     (pressing on)
     So I'm thinking that this device was in the middle of digging up
     these suppressed memories when -- bam -- it overloads and fries your
     brain. So instead of helping you remember, it actually made you
     forget. Everything.

   [Vala ignores him in favor of reading the ingredients on her snack's
   label.]

     VALA
     Disodium guanylate. That would make a great alien name, don't you
     think?

     MITCHELL

     (sighs)
     I can understand why you might be having difficulty believing what
     I'm telling you. But there is one thing you cannot deny. There are
     some very, very bad people after you.

   [Vala gets up and crosses to the bed, still eating her waffle thing and
   bearing a package of Twinkies.]

     VALA
     Mm. And how do I know you're not one of them?

   [She sits next to him.]

     MITCHELL
     Because I saved you from them!

     VALA
     What if they were trying to save me from you? How am I supposed to
     know?

     MITCHELL
     Let me take you back to Stargate Command. We have a device that can
     help you remember.

     VALA
     I thought you said the device was destroyed.

   [Mitchell tugs at the headboard in frustration.]

     MITCHELL
     It's a different device. It's one I brought back from another planet
     last year.

     VALA
     Oh, good. Were they having a sale?

   [Vala pulls a Twinkie out of the package and shoves it in his mouth.]

     MITCHELL
     Mmph.

   EXT--BACK ROAD, DAY

   [A nondescript silver sedan drives down the road.]

   INT--SILVER SEDAN

   [Devon from Athena's office is in the passenger seat, talking on his
   cell phone. Another man drives.]

     DEVON

     (into phone)
     Understood.
     (hangs up)
     We intercepted a communication from Stargate Command. They've found
     him. Turn around.

   EXT--BACK ROAD, DAY

   [The silver sedan come to the intersection, which has now been cleared,
   and makes a U-turn. It speeds back the way it came.]

   INT--MOTEL ROOM

   [The door bursts open. Teal'c, Carter and Daniel burst in wielding
   zats. They stop in utter confusion as they see Mitchell, shirtless and
   handcuffed to the bed. He's channel surfing, eating, and surrounded by
   the detritus of several snack cakes. He waves with his cuffed hand.]

     MITCHELL
     This, uh... isn't what it looks like.

   [The other three stare at him intensely. He pulls the bedspread up over
   his chest.]

   EXT--SUBURBAN STREET, DAY

   [Slowly and warily, Vala walks along a narrow street between an
   apartment building and a warehouse surrounded by a chain-link fence.
   Seeing a police cruiser at the next intersection, she slips through the
   gate and heads toward the warehouse.]

   INT--MOTEL ROOM

   [Mitchell has been released from the handcuffs and is finishing getting
   dressed. Daniel is on the phone, and Teal'c is reading the back of one
   of the snack cakes. Mitchell turns to find Carter watching him with a
   smirk on her face.]

     MITCHELL
     What?

     CARTER

     (innocently)
     Nothin'. I just think it's funny how you're always losing your
     pants.

   [Mitchell picks up his jacket and gingerly pulls it on, careful of his
   wounded arm.]

     MITCHELL
     I'm not always losing my pants. It's happened twice. Twice is not
     always.

     DANIEL

     (into phone)
     Okay, thank you.
     (hangs up)
     Uh, we've got something on Vala.

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [Tall industrial shelving holds crates, 50-gallon drums, etc. The
   hangar-style door slides open and SG-1 enters cautiously, all carrying
   zats. They start to spread out and search the building.]

     DANIEL

     (shouting)
     Vala? Vala, it's me, Daniel. We know you're in here. There's nowhere
     else you could've gone.

     MITCHELL

     (also shouting)
     Vala!

   [Mitchell sees a shadow moving on the far wall and starts towards it.]

     DANIEL
     Vala? I know you're scared. But we're not here to hurt you. We can
     help you remember.

   [On the other side of the room, a gunman kneels atop a shipping
   container. Teal'c sees him just as he raises an automatic weapon.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter!

   [Teal'c and Carter take cover behind some crates as the gunman starts
   firing at them. Daniel and Mitchell hear the commotion, but they've got
   problems of their own. Devon pops out from behind a stack of building
   supplies and opens fire on Mitchell. He ducks behind a pair of barrels,
   and fires back with his zat, but misses. In a dark corner, Vala pulls
   the handgun from the back of her jeans and pulls the slide. Carter
   takes out her shooter with a zat blast and moves closer to get a better
   angle on two more on the next container over. Mitchell and Devon
   continue trading fire. Vala makes a run for the door, but Daniel steps
   into her path. They're in a standoff, pistol vs. zat.]

     VALA
     Get out of my way.

   [Daniel shakes his head.]

     VALA

     (insistent)
     Get out of my way, or I will shoot you.

   [Daniel loosens his grip on his zat and drops it to the floor. He
   raises his hands, but makes no move to let her leave. Meanwhile,
   Mitchell zats the metal shelving the operative is behind, and the blast
   travels down the metal to knock the operative out.]

     DANIEL

     (soothingly)
     You don't remember who you are, but I do. You won't shoot.

   [Meanwhile, Carter and Teal'c are still trading fire with the two
   shooters on top of the shipping container. Mitchell comes at them from
   the side and fires, distracting them long enough for Carter and Teal'c
   to zat them. One of the shooters rolls off the high container onto a
   stack of wooden pallets. Vala is momentarily distracted by the sudden
   silence, but she recovers and goes back to pointing her gun at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     If I let you go, I know you're gonna make yourself disappear. You've
     been running so long it's almost second nature to you. You don't
     remember it, but you made a decision to stop running. It's over. Now
     it's time to come home.

   [Vala is hit with another series of flashbacks, but these are much more
   pleasant: SG-1 and Landry in a mission briefing, Daniel in a hallway at
   the SGC, Daniel riding in an elevator and smiling over his shoulder.
   Her memories appear to return. She is crying and takes a deep breath.]

     VALA

     (whispering, crying)
     Daniel.

   [She lowers the gun. Daniel takes it from her and sets it aside. He
   pulls her into a reassuring hug as the rest of the team makes their way
   over.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [SG-1 and Landry are gathered for an informal meeting. Mitchell has his
   arm in a sling.]

     MITCHELL
     Y'know, I don't mind gettin' shot, but I pulled a hammie when I took
     out that last Trust operative.

     CARTER

     (teasing)
     At least you didn't lose your pants.

   [Vala walks into the doorway and knocks on the wall. She seems to be in
   a bit of a hurry, as she's still pulling on her BDU jacket.]

     VALA

     (to Landry)
     You wanted to see me?

     DANIEL

     (cheerful)
     Hey! What did Doctor Lam say?

     VALA
     I've been cleared for active duty.

     LANDRY
     Glad to hear it.

   [Landry picks up a small box from the workbench and holds it out to
   Vala.]

     VALA
     What's this?

     LANDRY
     Let's just call it a welcome back present.

   [Vala looks at the team with a curious smile. She opens the box to
   reveal two round patches: SGC and SG-1.]

     VALA
     These are...

     LANDRY
     Team badges. You're now officially a member of SG-1.

   [Vala grins hugely and ducks her head.]

     CARTER
     Congratulations, you earned it.

   [Vala pulls out the SGC patch and admires it. Daniel and Mitchell smile
   in amusement. Vala shoves Landry's shoulder in lieu of a thank you.]

     TEAL'C

     (bowing slightly)
     Perhaps a celebration is in order.

     MITCHELL
     That's a great idea. We can check out that new rib joint near my
     place.

   [Mitchell gets up and walks over to Vala. He pulls the SG-1 patch out
   of the box and hands it to Teal'c, then takes the SGC patch out of her
   hands. As one, they press the patches onto the matching velcro patches
   on the sleeves of her jacket.]

     VALA

     Excellent.
     (to Daniel)
     Of course, that means we'll have to wait until next week to complete
     our date.

   [Everyone turns to stare curiously at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     It wasn't a date. It, it was two friends and coworkers out for
     dinner.

     MITCHELL
     Uh huh.

   [Mitchell leaves.]

     DANIEL

     (insistent)
     Seriously.

   [Carter give him a dubious look as she, Teal'c and Vala head out the
   door.]

     DANIEL

     Uh...
     (to Landry)
     It wasn't a date.

   [Landry just quirks his eyebrows noncommittally and walks out the door.
   Daniel is left alone in his office, exasperated.]

   FADE OUT
