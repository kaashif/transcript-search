   TEASER

   INT--AN ALIEN CHAMBER

   [The room has several columns of red draperies, a DHD, and a Stargate.
   It is quiet and deserted. The Stargate activates.SG-1 comes through
   it.]

     O'NEILL
     Looks like somebody's closed up for the winter, hmm?

   [They step into the room and investigate the sheer draperies, each of
   which seems to cover some sort of device.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c, is this Goa'uld technology?

     TEAL'C
     These devices are unfamiliar to me.

   [Carter picks up an electronic tablet and activates it. It shows
   Egyptian-looking symbols or icons.]

     CARTER
     Ah, this is interesting.

     DANIEL
     I wonder what's in there.

     MA'CHELLO

     (from behind a curtain)
     I am in there.

   [Alarmed, O'Neill and Carter bring up their weapons. Ma'chello enters
   from behind the curtain. He is a very old, frail-looking man.]

     MA'CHELLO
     I am unarmed.

     O'NEILL
     Who are you?

   [Teal'c walks up to him and stares at him for a moment.]

     TEAL'C
     You are the one called Ma'chello, are you not?

     MA'CHELLO
     Do I know you?

     TEAL'C

     You do not. But I have seen images of you. Though your face had not
     seen as many years, it was you.
     (to the others)
     Since before I was born, this man has been a fugitive from the
     System Lords. One of my first assignments as First Prime of Apophis
     was to hunt this man.

     DANIEL
     What did he do?

     TEAL'C
     He was developing advanced technology to battle the Goa'uld. He was
     captured and tortured. The System Lords marked him to become a
     Goa'uld host, so his knowledge could be retained. Before the
     ceremony of implantation, he killed several Jaffa and escaped.

     O'NEILL

     (disbelieving)
     He did that?

     MA'CHELLO
     I am not this person you speak of. You are mistaken.

     DANIEL
     Um, you don't have to be afraid. We're not Goa'ulds.

     MA'CHELLO
     We're not? Of course we are not! But if we are not Goa'ulds, who are
     we?

     DANIEL
     Well, I'm...I'm Daniel Jackson, from the planet Earth.

     MA'CHELLO
     Yes. Yes, that's right! I am Daniel Jackson from the planet Earth.
     Pleased to meet you.

     DANIEL
     No, I'm...I'm Daniel Jackson.

     MA'CHELLO
     No, I'm Daniel Jackson.

     CARTER
     Uh, these are very interesting machines. Are they inventions to
     fight the Goa'uld?

     MA'CHELLO
     Yes, inventions to fight the Goa'uld!

     DANIEL
     Well, do you think you could show us how they work?

     MA'CHELLO
     Are we sure we are not Goa'uld?

   [O'Neill rolls his eyes. Daniel nods]

     MA'CHELLO
     You, you, you...here, quickly. Inventions to fight the Goa'uld.

   [He uncovers one of the devices, which has two sets of handles, one on
   either end. He grabs one set of handles and nods to Daniel. Daniel
   grabs the other set. There is a sound and some sort of small jolt.
   Ma'chello falls to the ground.]

     CARTER
     Daniel?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     I'm fine. I think.
     (to Ma'chello/Daniel)
     Are you all right, sir?

     CARTER

     (checking Ma'chello)
     He's got a faint pulse.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Carter, why don't you dial us out of here? Teal'c, grab
     the gentleman. Let's take him back to the base.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [Shot of Ma'chello unconscious on the floor.]

   OPENING TITLES

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser enters. Daniel/Ma'chello is sitting on a bed.]

     FRAISER
     Well, everything seems fine. Yep, all your numbers are normal.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Good. I feel fine.

     FRAISER
     Yeah? You just...you seem a little out of it, Daniel. Is there
     something bothering you?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     No. I'm just exhausted.

     FRAISER
     Well, that's not unusual for someone who just received a
     high-voltage electric shock. Any idea what that machine was supposed
     to do?

   [He shakes his head.]

     FRAISER
     Okay, well if you are not back to normal in a couple of days, you
     let me know.

   [He stands up. She stops him with a hand on his arm.]

     FRAISER
     Uh, wait a minute. I don't want you driving for a couple of days.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     All right.

     FRAISER

     (bemused)
     Okay.

   [He stops to look at Ma'chello/Daniel, who is unconscious in the next
   bed, with an oxygen mask on his face.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     How is he?

     FRAISER
     Not good. He has severe scar tissue all over his body. Looks like he
     was burned or electrocuted. My guess is he was tortured.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     He's not going to live much longer, is he?

     FRAISER
     I don't think so.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond, O'Neill, Teal'c, and Carter are sitting at the table.]

     HAMMOND
     Let's continue without Doctor Jackson. Captain Carter, you were
     about to brief us about the device?

   [Carter is holding the electronic tablet she found on the planet.]

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. I believe it's some sort of database for all of
     Ma'chello's inventions. These symbols are like icons on a computer.
     When I press one of them, a schematic diagram appears with notes on
     the side.

     HAMMOND
     Any idea what any of it is?

     CARTER
     Well, sir, that's the problem. It's not in any dialect that I
     understand. I was hoping that Daniel or maybe Teal'c could shed some
     light on these symbols.

   [She hands the tablet to Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not recognize them.

   [Daniel/Ma'chello walks in.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I apologize.

     HAMMOND
     How are you, Doctor Jackson?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (sitting)
     Tired. Doctor Fraiser says it'll wear off in a few days. I'll be
     fine.

     CARTER

     (handing him the tablet)
     Daniel, do you recognize any of these symbols?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     No.

   [Carter looks uncertain about Daniel's response.]

     HAMMOND
     Keep trying, people. This could be some valuable technology.
     Dismissed.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     General. Doctor Fraiser thought I should go home, get some rest.

     HAMMOND
     Take a day.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Thank you.

   EXT--A CITY STREET, OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING

   [Daniel/Ma'chello gets out of the passenger side of a car.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Thank you, I'll be fine from here.

     AIRMAN
     Yes, sir.

   [He starts to go into the building but hesitates. A pretty woman exits
   the building, smiling at him, and he starts to follow her down the
   sidewalk.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Hammond is at the foot of Ma'chello/Daniel's bed when O'Neill, Carter,
   and Teal'c enter. Fraiser is standing near the head of the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     You called, sir?

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     Jack, Sam, Teal'c. Finally.

     O'NEILL
     How does this gentleman know our names?

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     As I've been trying to tell the General and the good Doctor here, I
     am not Ma'chello, I am Daniel Jackson.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, here we go.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     I realize what I look like. But I'm telling you, that machine
     somehow switched us.

     FRAISER
     He, uh, knows a lot about Daniel.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     Ask me anything. Something only Daniel would know.

     CARTER
     Okay. Who's Cassandra?

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     She's a twelve-year-old girl we found abandoned on P8X-987.

     O'NEILL
     P8X...

     CARTER
     987, yeah.

     O'NEILL
     All right, lucky guess.

     HAMMOND
     Where was the Stargate found?

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     At a dig in Giza.

     O'NEILL
     All right, describe for me the dress your sister wore last week when
     I took her out.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     I don't have a sister, Jack, and if I did, I wouldn't let you near
     her.

     HAMMOND
     Okay, let's assume for a moment that you are Daniel Jackson. Then
     who the hell did we just send home?

   EXT--ALONG A CITY STREET

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (to various people walking along, who all ignore him)
     Hello, friend. I am new to this area. I would like to learn about
     your culture and customs. Will you teach me? Do you not understand
     me?

     FRED

     (holding out a paper cup)
     Spare any change, please?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Why does no one answer me?

     FRED
     'Cause you're strange.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Am I? Tell me how I am strange.

     FRED
     Man, you can't be just walking up to people you don't know on the
     street, and talking all weird like that, asking for stuff.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Isn't that what you are doing?

     FRED
     Well, yeah, but...

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Then you must be strange as well.

     FRED
     I been called worse. Sure, I'm strange, too.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I am called Ma'chello.

     FRED
     I'm Fred.

   [They shake hands.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Let us feast together, Fred, and celebrate our strangeness, and
     new-found friendship.

     FRED
     On you?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     If that is the custom, we will feast on me!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Doctor Fraiser?

     FRAISER
     Well sir, medically speaking, he is an elderly gentleman suffering
     from acute pulmonary damage. With the conscious awareness and memory
     of Doctor Daniel Jackson.

     HAMMOND
     How?

     FRAISER
     Well I can't tell you the method used to do it, General, but I can
     tell you that our personality, our memory, our conscious selves are
     derived from unique networks of neurons in the cerebral cortex.
     Somehow Daniel's networks were remapped onto the old man's by that
     alien device.

     O'NEILL
     So this could be a one-way deal, right?

     FRAISER
     I'm not following, sir.

     O'NEILL
     We don't know that it went both ways. Daniel could still be Daniel.

     HAMMOND
     His doorman said he never came into the building after he was
     dropped off.

     O'NEILL
     There you go. Let's find him.

     CARTER
     And what if he isn't Daniel?

     HAMMOND
     We're going to have to prepare for that possibility. Doctor Fraiser?

     FRAISER
     Sir, this, uh, problem is beyond my expertise. I'm going to have to
     consult with some neural specialists, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

     O'NEILL
     General, wouldn't it be a little easier if we just went back, got
     this machine, tried to slam it into reverse?

     HAMMOND
     All right, Colonel, retrieve it. But consider that device hazardous
     material. Prepare yourself accordingly.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

   INT--MA'CHELLO'S CHAMBER

   [O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c enter from the Stargate, all dressed in
   full-body green hazmat suits.]

     CARTER
     I want to check out Ma'chello's room. Maybe he has some electronic
     notebooks that I can actually read.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Uh, Captain? Maybe you shouldn't touch anything in there.

     CARTER
     I'll be careful, sir.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c pull insulating block-like handles from a case.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, let me get mine on first, here.

   [O'Neill puts his handles over the handles of the switching device.
   Teal'c does the same.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, on three. One, two...

     CARTER

     (from behind a curtain, where she has seen a sort of bed)
     Colonel!

   [O'Neill pulls his hands back from the handles, spooked.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain?

     CARTER
     Sorry. Uh, I think I know how Ma'chello has lived so long. I think
     this is some sort of medical device. There's all sorts of tubes and
     thermal units that look like they're for life support.

     TEAL'C
     But Ma'chello was conscious when we found him.

     CARTER
     Well maybe it's triggered to automatically deactivate when someone
     comes through the Gate.

     TEAL'C
     Then we can place Daniel Jackson in the hibernation chamber so his
     body can be maintained.

     CARTER
     Yeah, possibly, if I can figure out how to get it to work again.

     O'NEILL
     How long, Captain?

     CARTER
     I don't know, sir. I might not be able to figure it out at all.

     O'NEILL
     Well, then, let's just get this thing back to Earth. It might be all
     we need. On three. One, two, three.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c grab the insulated handles they have placed on the
   device. The device makes a sound and vibrates. Teal'c looks surprised.]

     CARTER
     What?

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c come through the wormhole with the device
   on a cart.]

     HAMMOND
     How did it go, Colonel?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     It did not go well, General Hammond.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Ya think?

   [Everyone realizes Teal'c and O'Neill have switched bodies.]

   INT--SGC LABORATORY

   [The device is sitting on a table.]

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     This is indeed uncomfortable.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     How do you think I feel, Teal'c? I've got a snake in my gut. You've
     got a comfortable, normal body.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     It is normal to you, O'Neill. Having a symbiote within is normal to
     me.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Yeah, well, whatever. It's bad, okay?

   [Carter enters.]

     CARTER
     Hey.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Have they located Doctor Jackson?

     CARTER
     No, they're still looking. The good news is I found the switching
     device on Ma'chello's computer. The problem is all of the notations
     are in that strange dialect. You know, when you think about it, it's
     actually kind of a good think that this happened. I mean, I can
     experiment with the two of you, and then when we find Daniel,
     Ma'chello, we can reverse the process. Assuming of course that it's
     reversible.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Captain, can we just get on with this?

     CARTER
     Right. Well, uh, I couldn't find any buttons or switches, so unless
     I've missed something, it must be triggered by the handles
     themselves. I think that we should try different ways of grasping
     the handles. First, let's just try grasping it normally, the same
     way you did before.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c grasp the handles. A shortened sound is heard.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Nope. Still got Junior.

     CARTER
     All right. Uh, all right, uh, maybe there's an in and an out handle.
     Why don't you switch sides.

   [O'Neill/Teal'c spins the machine around on the table. They grasp the
   handles again. The same abortive-type sound is heard.]

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     We did not make progress.

     CARTER
     Okay, um, maybe it has something to do with the order in which you
     grab the handles.

   EXT--ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC LABORATORY

   [Some time has passed. Teal'c/O'Neill looks sweaty and restless.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     I'm not feeling so hot.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     What are you feeling, O'Neill.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     All of the sudden, Junior's moving around a lot in there.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     This likely means my body has contracted an illness my symbiote must
     repair.

     CARTER
     Illness. Great.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     It is common. The symbiote will remedy the problem.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Okay, when?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     It can only accomplish its work if you put your body into a state of
     kelno'reem.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Translation, Teal'c.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Similar to a state of hibernation.

     CARTER
     Meditation?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Perhaps, but I sense much deeper than that of any human meditation.
     It is imperative that you do this, O'Neill, or my body will be as if
     it has no immune system.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Okay. Tell me what to do.

   INT--TEAL'CS QUARTERS

   [O'Neill/Teal'c is lighting candles while Teal'c/O'Neill looks into a
   mirror on the wall. He looks quite ill.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL

     (speaking to his own reflection)
     You don't look so good. You mean I don't look so good.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     You will become increasingly ill as long as my symbiote does not
     have the opportunity to make the necessary repair.

   [Teal'c/O'Neill sits on a chair, weakly.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     So you're telling me this is just going to get worse.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     If you do not perform kelno'reem, it could lead to my death. Rather,
     your death.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     What do I do?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Please, be seated.

   INT--A DINER

   [Fred and Daniel/Ma'chello enter. A pretty waitress walks up to them.]

     WAITRESS
     Can I help you?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     Hello. This is Fred. I am Ma'chello. We wish to feast, on me.
     (louder)
     In fact, let everyone here feast on me.

     WAITRESS
     You celebrating something?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Indeed we are. Life.

     WAITRESS
     Okay, but I'm going to need a credit card.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     A credit card. Where would I find such a card?

     WAITRESS
     Usually, in your wallet.

   [She gestures to his pocket and he finds a wallet and takes it out,
   opens it, and shows it to her.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Will one of these cards do?

     WAITRESS

     (taking a gold one)
     Absolutely.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (gazing at her)
     You are one of the most enchanting women I have seen in my lifetime.
     I would be honored by a kiss.

     WAITRESS

     (smiling and walking away)
     Yeah, I bet you would.

   INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Very good, O'Neill.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     It is? I'm not feeling any better.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     You have not yet reached kelno'reem.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     So how do I do it?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     Relax. Concentrate. You must imagine the center of your mind and
     focus. Allow it to take you into a waking sleep. There you will
     dream. When you do so, it will be in harmony with the symbiote. Your
     subconscious minds will be as one. At that moment, you will have
     achieved kelno'reem. Here the symbiote will receive information
     necessary to repair your sickness.

   [Teal'c/O'Neill, eyes closed, appears to be succeeding.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Ma'chello/Daniel is in bed with books and one of Ma'chello's
   electronic tablets on a table over his lap. Carter is sitting with
   him.]

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL

     (defeated)
     It's useless.

   [He leans back into the pillow with his eyes closed]

     CARTER
     No, it's not. You've already figured out that it's a mixture of
     ancient Latin and Greek. We're getting closer.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL

     That's obvious because of the forms. The alphabets may be the same,
     but it's an entirely original language.
     (agitated and struggling)
     There's no sentence structure, there's no...

   [Medical monitor begins to be epinalarm.]

     CARTER
     Take it easy.

   [He appears to become unconscious as the machines continue to beep.
   Fraiser enters.]

     FRAISER

     His blood pressure's going up.
     (shines penlight into his eyes)
     He's not responding. Let's get a CT and check for hemorrhage. And,
     uh, get a respirator ready just in case.

     CARTER

     (alarmed)
     Janet?

     FRAISER
     He's non-responsive. He's in a coma.

   INT--DINER

   [The waitress takes away empty plates and sets down hot-fudge sundaes
   in front of Daniel/Ma'chello and Fred.]

     FRED
     Dig in, Ma'chello, before the hot fudge melts all the ice cream.

   [Daniel/Ma'chello takes a big bite of whipped cream, leaving bits of it
   around his mouth.]

     FRED
     So, uh, I get the feeling you fought in the Gulf. Am I right?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     No, but I was a soldier. I fought many battles. I was captured and
     tortured.

     FRED
     That explains a lot.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I continued to fight, and lost all that I loved and cared for. But I
     knew I could not surrender. For you. If it were not for me, you
     would all be conquered by now.

     FRED

     (incredulous)
     By who, Saddam?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     He is not a System Lord I am familiar with. But several others would
     have wiped you out.

     FRED
     Whatever you say, man.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     But I do not wish to fight any longer. From now on I only want to
     eat hamburgers and french fries and ice cream sundaes, and I want to
     be with good people like you, Fred.

     FRED
     All good things come to an end, Ma'chello.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Oh no, my friend. Only evil things must come to an end. For good
     things, such as ourselves, it is possible to go on forever.

     FRED
     Cool.

   INT--TEAL'C QUARTERS

   [Teal'c/O'Neill opens his eyes, looking amazed.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL

     Whoa. Sweet.
     (turns to look at Teal'c/O'Neill, becomes alarmed)
     Teal'c?

   [O'Neill/Teal'c is beginning to cut his hair withapairofscissors.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     What are you doing?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     If I am to remain in this body, I must shave my head.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     You're making a joke, right?

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     I am not joking.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you will not shave my head.

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     It is presently my head, O'Neill.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Teal'c, this is temporary!

     O'NEILL/TEAL'C
     And, if it is not?

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Just give 'em a chance to find Daniel, okay? Teal'c, I'm going to
     see General Hammond. Promise me you won't touch the head until I get
     back.

   [O'Neill/Teal'c raises an eyebrow as Teal'c/O'Neill leaves.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond waves Teal'c/O'Neill in.]

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Sir, I feel like I need to be involved in finding Daniel.

     HAMMOND
     Well, I think we may have him soon. Daniel's credit card was just
     used at a local diner.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Request permission to go there, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Denied. You'll remain here until they bring him in. Be patient,
     Colonel.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     I can't be patient, sir. Daniel is dying. And I'd rather we get to
     Ma'chello than risk some yahoo civvy officer shooting him and
     blowing any chance we have of saving him.

     HAMMOND

     Much as I'd like to, you're not exactly yourself.
     (standing to face him)
     Request denied.

   EXT--ALONG A CITY STREET

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     It has been a lifetime since I have enjoyed such companionship,
     Fred. I have truly enjoyed it.

     FRED
     Likewise.

   [They look at a passing woman.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     How does one court a wife, Fred?

     FRED
     Usually with lots of time, energy, and those credit cards.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Good. Let us begin now.

   [Two policemen have approached them from behind.]

     COP
     Hold it there, buddy.

   [Daniel/Ma'chello and Fred turn around to face the officers.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I will not go back. It is impossible.

     COP
     Put your hands behind your head.

   [Fred does so.]

     FRED
     Do it Ma'chello. You don't know these cops like me.

   [Daniel/Ma'chello turns and runs. Cops begin to chasehim.]

     FRED
     Don't shoot him, man! He's a hero!

   [Daniel/Ma'chello runs right into a police car. Three officers grab him
   and force him face down onto the hood of the car. They handcuff his
   hands behind his back.]

     FRED
     Aw, don't hurt him.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (standing and turning to face Fred)
     You were right, Fred. All good things do come to an end.

   [They push Daniel/Ma'chello into the back of the police car.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Carter is standing at the foot of Ma'chello/Daniel's bed.]

     CARTER

     (anguished)
     Come on, Daniel. They've found the guy, they're bringing him in. You
     have to wake up.

   [She moves to the side of the bed and takes his hand, then leans over
   him.]

     CARTER
     Daniel. You can't die on me now.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL

     (weakly)
     It's nice to know you don't just like me for my looks.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Hey.

   [She looks up at the sound of footsteps]

     CARTER
     Janet.

   FRAISER
   (smiling to see Ma'chello/Daniel awake)
   Well, it is good to have you back, Doctor Jackson. You have impeccable
   timing. Sam, they're on their way in. We should get that machine of his
   in here.</blockquote>

   [Carter kisses Ma'chello/Daniel on the temple, then leaves.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Carter and Fraiser wheel in the body-switching device. Teal'c/O'Neill
   is standing next to Ma'chello/Daniel's bed. Hammond enters followed by
   Daniel/Ma'chello and two SF's.]

     HAMMOND
     Reverse what you've done to my people.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I cannot do what is impossible.

     HAMMOND
     Then you won't cooperate?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     On the contrary, I am telling you the truth. It is not possible.

     CARTER
     Why not?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     In simplest terms, the device retains a memory of every
     transference. For the very reason you are asking me, I designed it
     so that it encrypts the transference, blocking any reversal.

     HAMMOND
     Then reprogram it so it will unblock it.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     You do not have the necessary technology. Even if I wanted to change
     it, I could not.

   INT--SGC BRIG

   [Daniel/Ma'chello is inside, alone. An SF opens the door; Hammond and
   Carter enter. Carter is holding one of Ma'chello's electronic tablets.]

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Thank you for coming.

     CARTER
     Hope you're enjoying the scenery. It's the only view you'll have for
     the rest of your life.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Yes, that is why I called you. I thought perhaps I might be able to
     negotiate for better accommodations.

     HAMMOND
     We're listening.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (sits on the lower bunk bed)
     First, let me apologize for the unfortunate transference of your
     Colonel and the Jaffa.

     HAMMOND
     Just get to the point.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     The symbols you've no doubt tried to decipher are unique. In form
     they're similar to my native language, but they're actually an
     original code I devised, in case my work came into enemy hands.

     HAMMOND
     We're not your enemy. If anything, we're allies.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     That is why I will teach Captain Carter that code. With my knowledge
     I guarantee you not only will you be able to effectively defend
     yourselves against the Goa'uld, you will in fact be able to defeat
     them.

     CARTER
     And our cost for this knowledge?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     My freedom, of course.

     HAMMOND
     And Doctor Jackson?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     He is not an issue.

     CARTER
     Not an issue? We're talking about a friend's life.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Your friend was my solution to hiding my face permanently. Consider
     him a casualty of war. I am offering you the salvation of your
     planet. Is this not worth more than the life of one archaeologist?

     HAMMOND

     (serious, indignant)
     I don't know about the customs of your planet, but here on Earth,
     the value of a life is priceless.

   [Hammond leaves.]

     CARTER
     I want you to get to know your casualty.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Carter enters, followed by Daniel/Ma'chello. Carter angrily makes him
   sit in the chair next to Ma'chello/Daniel.]

     CARTER
     I believe you two have met.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     Well, from what I can see, you're looking good.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (patronizing)
     What would you like me to say? I am sorry? That I wish I could undo
     it? I do not.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     Why?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Why? Because I earned it. That is why. I earned it because I
     sacrificed my life for you and your people. The least you could do
     was compensate me with another.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     What right do you have to judge the value of my life?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I have suffered more than anyone should suffer in a lifetime. For
     fifty years I fought against the Goa'uld. Then I was betrayed by my
     wife, whom they secretly turned into a host.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     So was mine. She is still with them.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     At least you still have a planet. And friends. Two billion of my
     people died rather than surrender me to the Goa'uld.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     You have made great sacrifices. We owe you gratitude. But still it
     does not give you the right to take another's life.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     If you had the technology, you would do the same.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     No, I wouldn't. Because then I would become no better than the
     Goa'uld.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO

     (angry)
     I am not a Goa'uld. I hate the Goa'uld.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     The Goa'uld use hosts because they think they are better than
     humans. Because they believe they deserve it. You're a Goa'uld,
     Ma'chello. I am nothing but a host to you.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     I am not a Goa'uld.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL
     My wife is still alive. There is a chance I can still save her. You
     are stealing that chance.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Even if you still had this body, you will never find her.

     MA'CHELLO/DANIEL

     (defiant but weak)
     I will find her. I will find her.

   [He goes still, but with his eyes open. Tears run down his temple. The
   heart monitor alarm goes off. The display shows his heart has stopped.]

     FRAISER

     He's in V-Fib.
     (begins compressions on Ma'chello/Daniel's chest)
     Prepare the paddles!
     (keeps up compressions)
     Come on, Daniel!

   [Slow motion view of Fraiser doing CPR, Carter upset, looking at
   Daniel/Ma'chello, who is now uncertain. Heart monitor display shows a
   pulse starting up.]

     FRAISER
     Wait a minute. I've got a heartbeat, but I don't know for how long.
     Give me one mil eppy.

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     If I could trade places with him again, I would. But unfortunately,
     I am the only one who cannot.

     CARTER
     Wait a minute. You're the only one who can't?

     DANIEL/MA'CHELLO
     Yes.

     CARTER

     (to SF)
     Get Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c/O'Neill, Hammond, and O'Neill/Teal'c walking through the
   corridor into the infirmary.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     What's going on, Captain?

     CARTER
     I think I may have come up with a solution to this whole mess.

     TEAL'C/O'NEILL
     Finally.

     FRAISER
     Well, whatever you're going to do, do it fast.

     CARTER

     All right, it's a little complicated, so I need you to do exactly as
     I say. We're going to have to play a little musical chairs with your
     bodies. First, Colonel, you and Ma'chello will switch.
     (Teal'c/O'Neill looks doubtful)
     Trust me, Colonel.

   [Daniel/Ma'chello and Teal'c/O'Neill grab the handles of the device.
   The device makes the same transference sound as before.]

     CARTER

     (to Daniel/O'Neill)
     Colonel?

     DANIEL/O'NEILL
     I'm here.

     CARTER
     How do you feel, physically?

     DANIEL/O'NEILL
     Peachy.

     TEAL'C/MA'CHELLO
     The transference was successful. Physically we are fine. Please
     continue, Captain.

     CARTER

     All right.
     (to O'Neill/Teal'c)
     Now you and Daniel should switch.

   [She pulls the device over to Ma'chello/Daniel's bed. She places his
   hands on the handle of the device. O'Neill/Teal'c grabs the other
   handles, and the transference takes place.]

     O'NEILL/DANIEL
     Whoa! Whoa, what a dream. What happened?

     CARTER
     I don't have time to explain right now, Daniel. Just bear with me.

     O'NEILL/DANIEL
     Okay.

     DANIEL/O'NEILL
     Danny-boy.

   [He gestures with a finger for him to walk over]

     O'NEILL/DANIEL
     Jack?

   [He walks over to join Daniel/O'Neill]

     TEAL'C/MA'CHELLO

     (to Carter)
     I wish I had time to teach you the symbols. In your hands my
     inventions could go on fighting the Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     It's all right, I'll figure it out. Please.

   [He grabs the handles, and Ma'chello transfers back into his own body.]

     TEAL'C
     I am myself again. Thank you, Captain Carter.

     CARTER
     Any time.

   [Fraiser and Carter take Ma'chello's hands off the device. Carter
   gestures to Daniel/O'Neill and O'Neill/Daniel to come over to the
   machine.]

     DANIEL/O'NEILL

     (patting O'Neill/Daniel on the shoulder)
     Our turn.

   [They grab the handles and exchange bodies.]

     O'NEILL

     Yes, Yes!
     (to Teal'c)
     Shave my head!?

   [He pats Teal'c on the belly and face.]

     DANIEL
     I'm back.

     FRAISER
     He's conscious again.

   [Daniel approaches him.]

     MA'CHELLO

     (to Daniel)
     Thank you, for my holiday.

   [Ma'chello dies. Fraiser closes his eyes with her hand. She is tearful.
   She turns off the blaring heart monitor. Everyone looks sad at his
   death.]

     HAMMOND

     (somberly)
     Welcome back, SG-1.

   FADE OUT
