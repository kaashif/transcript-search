     VALA

     (low to Carter)
     Wasn't Daniel telling me about a very powerful weapon in the hands
     of the Jaffa on Dakara?

     CARTER
     It's not a weapon, technically. But we did adapt it to destroy the
     Replicators.

     VALA

     (smiling but confused)
     Wait, wait, where are you going? I want to see!

   [The nursemaid looks back at her but begins to go through the opening
   doors. Tomis is with her. A Prior looks on.]

     VALA
     Can I hold her? She's my baby!

     PRIOR
     She will be the beacon of light in the darkness, to the warriors of
     the Ori. She will lead us to glorious victory.

   INT--VALA AND TOMIN'S QUARTERS, ORI WARSHIP

     DANIEL
     Wait, wait, wait. We're talking about a baby here, right?

     VALA
     She's been genetically altered. She'll be a fully grown figurehead
     in a day or so.

   INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala are surrounded by flames. Vala is injured, and Adria
   lies unconscious.]

     VALA
     Leave me, grab her.

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah, like that's going to happen.

   [The Asgard beam begins to activate. Sensing it, Daniel wraps his arms
   around Vala. They beam out together.]

   high council Jaffa robes.]

     TEAL'C
     Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori. According to those who
     witnessed the battle, the enemy is led by a young woman of
     extraordinary powers.

   [Vala looks shaken.]

   TEASER

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [An Ori warship sits on the surface of an alien planet, beside a
   village.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The warship looms above the village, which is comprised of stone
   buildings with steep roofs, similar to 17th Century Europe. Villagers
   dressed in simple clothing gaze up at a Prior who is speaking to them
   from a second-story balcony. He wears a brown robe and a large pendant
   symbol of Origin. Near him is a large standard also bearing the Origin
   symbol in brown, on yellow fabric.]

     PRIOR
     Mark this day, for the darkness of your world has been lifted so the
     light of Origin may shine upon it.

   [The villagers cheer and raise their hands in praise. In the audience
   are Mitchell, Carter, Daniel, Teal'c, and Vala, all dressed in village
   clothing. They look around in interest.]

     PRIOR

     You have cast aside the shackles of the past to welcome a brighter
     future.
     (reverently)
     Now, hear the words of the Orici.

   [Curtains on a door to the interior open, and out comes a beautiful
   woman dressed in a strapless dress with a large pendant around her
   neck. The crowd whispers in surprise and curiosity.]

     VALA

     (to Daniel)
     It's Adria!

   [Daniel is surprised; he had not recognized the adult Adria.]

     ADRIA
     The unbelievers amongst you sought to hinder our message. They took
     up arms in an attempt to suppress the truth. But they failed and
     were vanquished. A reminder to all that Origin cannot be
     extinguished. It will flourish throughout this world and countless
     others.

   [The crowd cheers enthusiastically. After a moment she holds up her
   right hand to quiet them.]

     ADRIA

     The believers amongst you have been richly rewarded -- with truth,
     with Origin... It is now up to you to help others see as you have
     seen.
     (voice rising)
     To spread the message by joining the armies of the Ori.

   [The crowd cheers. She steps back, says something brief to the Prior
   and goes inside.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR PLANET

   [The Odyssey is in orbit around the planet.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Marks is looking at his console instruments.]

     MARKS
     Sir, I'm picking up an energy reading coming from the surface of the
     planet.

     EMERSON
     What is it?

   [His console shows a schematic of a wave spreading in a circle from a
   point on the planet.]

     MARKS

     (urgently)
     It's a wave of radiation, sir. Emanating from the gate, spreading
     fast.

     EMERSON
     Get 'em out of there.

   [Marks makes inputs into his console.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The villagers see something strange approaching; they whisper
   nervously. The Prior looks up in surprise as well. Daniel and the
   others are beamed away.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The wave of radiation approaches the village and Ori warship very
   quickly. It appears as a high wall of light distortion. It passes
   across the village and ship with no apparent affect, seen from a
   distance.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [SG-1 and Vala arrive on the bridge via the Asgard beam. They look
   around in confusion.]

     MITCHELL
     What happened?

     EMERSON
     That's what we're trying to figure out.

     MARKS
     Sir, I'm not picking up any life signs on the planet.

     CARTER
     That's impossible.

   [She joins Emerson at Marks' console.]

     EMERSON
     What is it, sensor malfunction?

     MARKS

     (at a loss)
     All systems are operating normally.

     DANIEL

     (stepping over)
     There are thousands of people on that planet.

     CARTER
     He's right. We're not picking up anything.

   [Vala appears disturbed by the news.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Where there were villagers are now just piles of empty clothing. Even
   the Prior's robes are lying on the balcony wall.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--CORRIDOR OF ODYSSEY

   [Dressed now in black BDU's, Vala walks through the corridors,
   adjusting her sleeves. Daniel comes jogging up from behind her, also in
   black BDU's.]

     DANIEL
     Vala, wait!

   [They begin walking together.]

     DANIEL
     Look, we-we still don't know what happened down there.

     VALA

     (trying to be matter of fact)
     They're all dead, Daniel, that's what happened.

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry.

     VALA
     What for?

     DANIEL
     Well, believe it or not, I know how you feel.

   [Vala stops, as does Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Adria was your daughter, and even though she was--

     VALA

     Relief. That's what I feel, relief.
     (at Daniel's surprise)
     What, you don't think I'd want to be responsible for the enslavement
     of an entire galaxy, do you?

     DANIEL
     It was hardly your fault.

     VALA
     I knew she was the will of the Ori even before she was born. I could
     have done something about it, but I didn't.

     DANIEL
     She was your child.

     VALA
     Maternal instinct can only excuse so much. Of course I did tell
     myself that my relationship with her might prove to be an advantage.
     That at some point, some critical moment, I might be able to reach
     her in a way that no one else could.

     DANIEL
     And you might have been right.

     VALA
     I'm just relieved I'll never have to find out for sure.

   [She turns and walks quickly away, leaving Daniel to contemplate what
   she has said.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Unscheduled off-world activation.

   [The wormhole is established. Landry descends the stairs into the
   control room.]

     LANDRY
     Chief.

     HARRIMAN
     Receiving Bra'tac's IDC, sir.

     LANDRY
     Open the iris.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The iris opens. Landry enters from the corridor. Bra'tac descends the
   ramp, dressed in Jaffa robes.]

     LANDRY
     Bra'tac! What brings you by.

     BRA'TAC

     (placing a hand on Landry's shoulder)
     A matter that threatens millions of lives.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Odyssey personnel in red hazmat isolation suits are taking readings
   from the area with Geiger counters and other instruments.]

     EMERSON

     (over radio)
     Lieutenant Evans, report.

     EVANS
     There's no sign of residual radiation, sir.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Carter and Emerson are listening to Evans' report.]

     EVANS

     (via radio)
     No chemical or biological agents in the atmosphere. The place is
     clean.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Evans is walking amid the clothing as she continues speaking.]

     EVANS

     (into radio)
     The weird thing is, whatever it was, it only seems to have targeted
     living tissue. Because everything else was left behind.

   [She kneels beside a suit of Ori warrior armor.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Carter, Mitchell and Teal'c are there with the crew.]

     CARTER
     You said the wave emanated from the Stargate.

     MARKS
     That's right. From there it spread over the entire surface of the
     planet before dissipating.

   [Teal'c looks up in realization.]

     EMERSON
     What?

     TEAL'C
     We know of only one device that would operate in such a manner.

   [Carter shakes her head as if in denial.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry and Bra'tac enter and walk toward the window overlooking the
   gate room.]

     BRA'TAC
     The council is convinced our only hope for survival against the
     armies of the Ori is to attack them using the Ancient device on
     Dakara.

     LANDRY
     The same device we used to wipe out the Replicators.

     BRA'TAC
     Except that now it strikes with new purpose. To unmake living
     beings. Hours ago the first target was struck. A planet--

     LANDRY
     We already know about it. SG-1 was there, doing recon.

   [Bra'tac appears shocked and worried.]

     LANDRY
     They were beamed out before your weapon could hit them. The
     villagers weren't so lucky.

     BRA'TAC
     That is tragic.

     LANDRY

     (angry)
     It's mass murder! Why the hell didn't you do something about it?

     BRA'TAC
     Our new leader Se'tak has convinced the council that this is our
     only hope for survival. The more I spoke out against it, the more
     isolated I became.

     LANDRY

     (intensely)
     I need to contact the Odyssey, let them know what's happening. And
     then I need to meet this man myself.

   [Landry turns and walks away.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Mitchell and Teal'c look down on the planet through the forward
   viewscreen. Carter joins them.]

     TEAL'C
     I am ashamed that my brothers have utilized these methods.

     MITCHELL
     They're desperate.

     TEAL'C
     There is no honor. Freedom without honor is meaningless.

     MITCHELL
     What's done is done. And there's still an opportunity here.

     CARTER
     We've got an Ori ship sitting on the ground, unmanned and unguarded.

     TEAL'C

     (as if guessing the Jaffa will come)
     We must act quickly.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [SG-1 and Vala beam into the ship. They are all in black BDU's and
   carry machine guns, which they hold at the ready.]

     MITCHELL
     You know your way around this tub?

     VALA
     All the corridors look the same. I haven't got my bearings yet.

     CARTER
     There has to be some sort of control room. I'm guessing it'll be in
     one of the forward sections.

     MITCHELL
     We've got a lot of ground to cover. TIme to split up.

   [Mitchell heads in one direction, and Teal'c follows. The other three
   head down a different corridor.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Daniel and Vala search together as they walk and talk.]

     VALA
     Can I ask you a question?

     DANIEL
     Just the fact that you have to ask me to ask me makes me think I
     should say no.

     VALA
     Back on the Odyssey, you said you knew how I felt. What did you
     mean?

     DANIEL
     What?

     VALA
     Well, with Adria. You said, "believe it or not I know how you feel."
     What did you mean?

   [Daniel sighs and groans a little. He looks into a room, his back to
   Vala.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah. Um.

   [He turns back toward her then moves on in his search.]

     DANIEL
     Ten years ago, my wife was taken as host by a Goa'uld.

   [Vala looks shocked. She begins to follow him, jogging to catch up.]

     VALA
     The framed picture, on the wall in your office, is that her?

     DANIEL
     Yeah. Her name was Sha're. We'd been married for just over a year
     when she was...taken. I swore I would get her back.

     VALA
     What happened?

   [They stop and Daniel faces Vala.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, I joined SG-1 and searched for her for over two years, but in
     the end I couldn't save her. For a long time I felt guilty that I'd
     failed her.

     VALA
     And now?

     DANIEL
     Now I can at least draw comfort from the fact that she's no longer
     suffering at the hands of the Goa'uld. I guess in a small way, I
     feel relieved as well.

   [Daniel looks a bit uncomfortable and turns to continue walking. Vala
   looks after him sympathetically.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Teal'c arrive at a closed door. Mitchell waves his hand
   in front of the door, and it opens. As Teal'c guards the corridor,
   Mitchell glances inside the room.]

     MITCHELL
     Wow. Check this out.

   [Teal'c turns around and stands beside Mitchell. The room is a huge
   chamber, many stories high. Suspended in the middle and reachable via a
   walkway is an elongated vertical structure with a glowing white ball
   sitting in the middle, above a pedestal.]

     MITCHELL
     I'm no expert, but... this looks important.

     TEAL'C
     It appears to be a power generation chamber.

     MITCHELL
     Exactly. Which has me thinkin'. It could be a good place to drop a
     little C-4.

   [He hands some blocks of C-4 to Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     It would be our best opportunity to disable the vessel should it be
     necessary.

     MITCHELL

     (kneeling and pulling items from his vest pockets)
     Just in case we can't get this thing flying before the Ori come
     back, we win one for the home team, while we're hauling ass for the
     gate.

     TEAL'C
     Umm. A great Jaffa warrior once said exalted is the warrior who
     achieves victory without battle.

     MITCHELL
     Winning shows strength. Winning without fighting shows true skill.

     TEAL'C
     Hmm. You are a student of ancient strategies.

   [Mitchell stands up, C-4 blocks and detonators ready and in hand.]

     MITCHELL
     No, General Landry said it to me. I think he was quoting Sun Tzu. Or
     it could have been Doctor Phil.

   [They proceed onto the walkway toward the power generator.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Landry and Harriman walk side by side. Landry is dressed in dessert
   BDU's.]

     LANDRY
     I've already advised the Pentagon that I'm heading off-world. I may
     be a while.

     HARRIMAN
     With all due respect, sir, uh, you think you might consider taking
     along a few marines?

     LANDRY
     This is a diplomatic mission, Chief. The last time I checked the
     Jaffa were our allies. I can't go disrespecting them in their own
     house.

     HARRIMAN
     If you say so, sir.

     LANDRY
     Sometimes you make the right decisions, sometimes you make the
     decision right.

     HARRIMAN
     Patton.

     LANDRY
     That one's Doctor Phil. Now if you'll excuse me, Bra'tac is waiting.

   [Landry walks away; Harriman raises his eyebrows then turns and goes
   the opposite direction.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter enters a large room, weapon raised. In the center on a raised
   platform is a single large chair in the Ori style. Beside it are a set
   of empty Prior robes and a Prior staff.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Guys, I think I've found something.

     DANIEL

     (over radio)
     What have you got?

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Daniel and Vala are walking.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     I think it might be the bridge.

   [Daniel and Vala stop walking.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     And it looks like the main command interface is a chair, similar to
     the weapons platform in Antarctica.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Well it makes sense that the technology would be similar to the
     Ancients'.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter circles the command chair and kneels beside the robes and
   staff.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Vala, you said most of the people on this ship were simple
     villagers, right?

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     VALA

     (into radio)
     Yes, why?

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     CARTER

     (into radio, handling Prior staff)
     Well, I think it's likely the Priors who are flying the ships.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Teal'c listen in as they walk.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Unfortunately that probably means the chair is keyed to their unique
     brain physiology.

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Don't sweat it. Plan B is in place.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter is near a console along the wall of the bridge.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Okay, let's not jump the gun just yet. At the very least I'd like to
     try to get some information out of this database before we start
     blowing things up.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     I hear you, Sam, but it won't be long before the Ori come back for
     this ship. We're not gonna let 'em--

   [Teal'c reaches out with his machine gun and stops Mitchell. Teal'c
   listens for a moment. There are sounds of marching boots nearby. They
   hear something behind them and turn to face it, weapons raised. There
   is a sound of staff weapons powering on.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Cam? Cam, what's happening?

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Not much. But we've got ourselves some company.

   [Four Jaffa warriors in full armor are facing Mitchell and Teal'c,
   aiming zats and staff weapons at them. The one in front speaks.]

     BO'REL
     I am Bo'rel of the free Jaffa. We have come to lay claim to this
     vessel.

     MITCHELL
     Slow down, brother. We were here first.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Cam, report.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     It's all right, Sam. Just a little misunderstanding with some of our
     Jaffa friends. Go back to work.

     BO'REL
     There is no misunderstanding. We achieved this victory, therefore we
     claim the spoils.

     TEAL'C
     What you have done is sacrifice the lives of thousands of innocents.

     BO'REL
     No one is innocent who joins my enemy.

     MITCHELL
     They were invaded by an army with massively superior fire power.

     BO'REL
     They should have resisted.

     MITCHELL
     So, die at the hands of the Ori or die at the hands of the Jaffa.
     Some choice.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter touches something on the console. There is a sound of power
   dropping, and all the lights in the ship dim.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

     DANIEL
     What was that?

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and the others note the lights.]

     BO'REL
     Enough of this! The ship is ours, now lower your weapons!

     MITCHELL
     That's not going to happen.

     TEAL'C

     (warningly)
     Colonel Mitchell.

   [Other Jaffa have approached from the corridor to their right. At a
   signal, Teal'c starts to fire at the Jaffa in front of them and
   Mitchell turns to fire to the right. Mitchell is immediately hit by a
   zat blast and falls to the floor. Teal'c fires his machine gun
   continuously but the Jaffa take cover.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Nearby, Daniel and Vala hear the firing.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Sam, we've got trouble!

   [They run in the direction of the firing.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c grabs Mitchell's machine gun and starts firing with one in each
   hand. He takes cover around a corner from the Jaffa.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Odyssey, this is Carter, requesting immediate extraction.

     EMERSON

     Do it.

   [Marks works his console but nothing happens.]

     EMERSON
     Major?

     MARKS
     Something's wrong. I can't get a lock on them.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [The Jaffa are firing staff blasts at Teal'c from around the corner. A
   Jaffa sneaks up behind him. Teal'c sees him, but not in time to stop
   the Jaffa from firing a zat at him. Teal'c slides to the floor
   unconscious. Bo'rel walks quietly into the corridor to gaze at both
   Mitchell and Teal'c lying on the floor.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Odyssey, what's happening?

     EMERSON

     We're getting too much signal degradation for successful beam-out.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     As far as I can tell, the malfunction's not coming from this end.

     VALA

     (into radio)
     Why would you do that?

     CARTER

     (over radio, a bit annoyed)
     It wasn't intentional.

     Oh.

   She kneels down to look inside.]

     (over radio)
     All right. Be advised that we're leaving range to avoid detection.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (to Marks)
     Get us out of here.

   [Marks complies; Emerson appears tense.]

   EXT--GATE ON DAKARA, DAY

   INT--PLANNING ROOM ON DAKARA

   [The Jaffa Se'tak speaks to his council.]

     SE'TAK
     The Ori, it turns out, are not invincible. This first strike against
     them must be considered nothing less than a complete success.

     BRA'TAC

     (entering the room)
     But at what cost?

   [Bra'tac stands at the entrance, with Landry.]

     SE'TAK

     (to council)
     Leave us.

   [They leave; Bra'tac and Landry enter.]

     SE'TAK
     Unable to gather support from your fellow Jaffa, you dishonor
     yourself by seeking it elsewhere.

     LANDRY
     I'm honored. General Hank Landry.

   [He makes a small bow.]

     SE'TAK
     The Tau'ri, your people...

     LANDRY
     Are pissed. Your use of this Ancient device violates our prior
     agreement.

     SE'TAK
     An agreement made with the former leadership, that I no longer feel
     bound to.

     LANDRY
     So you're gonna have your people go back on their word?

     SE'TAK
     Much has changed since my predecessors consented to that agreement.
     We now face an enemy powerful enough to have rendered our
     conventional weapons useless. Your forces have proven equally
     ineffective. This device is our only means of striking back at them.

     LANDRY
     Which includes slaughtering innocent people.

     SE'TAK

     (stepping forward, intensely)
     If future attacks against armies of the Ori allow us to recover
     enough of their ships, we will then have a powerful fleet with which
     to strike back against them. But until then, this device is our only
     option.

     LANDRY
     Incidental genocide is not an option.

     SE'TAK
     Granted. The cost of victory is great, but the cost of defeat would
     be even greater.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Daniel and Vala run down the corridor. Daniel stops them when he hears
   the sounds of Jaffa marching. He gestures for her to move, and they
   turn into a side chamber before the four Jaffa come around a different
   corner.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [A book sits open on a table. Unlit candelabras sit on either side of
   it. Across the room, beside the door to the corridor, are two flames
   burning in Ori-styled pedestals. Daniel and Vala are crouched on the
   floor behind the table, hiding from the passing Jaffa.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

   [Mitchell lies unconscious on his side on a rug on the floor. A Jaffa
   prods him with a staff weapon, and he slowly wakes. Teal'c sits on a
   chair against the wall nearby.]

     MITCHELL

     (waking, moving)
     All right. All right!

   [Mitchell sits up and groans as he rubs his eyes. He looks around until
   he sees Teal'c.]

     BO'REL
     Where is the rest of your team, Colonel Mitchell?

     MITCHELL
     I don't what you're talking about.

     BO'REL

     (crouching near him)
     You were speaking with a female.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, right. Um, she's back at the village. Probably gone through the
     gate by now.

     BO'REL
     You are lying!

   [He stands and activates Mitchell's radio.]

     BO'REL

     (into Mitchell's radio)
     This is a message to all Tau'ri on board this vessel.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala listen.]

     BO'REL

     (over radio)
     My name is Bo'rel. My brothers and I have taken this ship in the
     name of all free Jaffa.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter listens.]

     BO'REL

     (over radio)
     We have Teal'c and Colonel Mitchell in custody. Surrender now, and
     no harm will come to them.

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL

     (into radio)
     If you do not identify yourselves immediately, we will have no
     choice but to assume your intentions are hostile. In which case, we
     will deal with the prisoners harshly.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala hear but don't answer.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter looks around in concern but also doesn't answer.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL

     (into radio)
     So be it.

   [He nods at a Jaffa, who activates his staff weapon, aimed at Mitchell.
   Behind him Teal'c stands, agitated. Bo'rel holds the radio, perhaps
   allowing the others to hear the staff activate.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter moves to activate her radio but hears Daniel first.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Bo'rel, this is Daniel Jackson of Stargate Command. Listen, there's
     no reason we should be fighting each other. We should be working
     together.

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL

     (into radio)
     I'm afraid that would not be possible.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Look, we're dealing with some very advanced technology, and we have
     some experience that might be useful.

   [Vala nods in approval of his tactic.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL

     (into radio, insulted)
     You doubt our ability to fly this ship?

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Vala tries to take Daniel's radio, but he pulls it away.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     I'm just saying, there's not a lot of time, and it would be in
     everyone's best interest if we pool our resources.

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL

     (into radio)
     My orders are to take this ship and all on board. You will reveal
     your location to me now.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala hear the sound of staff weapons charging behind them.
   They cautiously rise to look over the top of the table at the room
   entrance. They see that four Jaffa have found them and stand up,
   putting their hands up. The Jaffa hold their weapons on them.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     That won't be necessary.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter listens.]

     JAFFA

     (over radio)
     Bo'rel, we have them.

     BO'REL
     Well done. Hold them until our patrols find the control room.

   [Carter goes back to working on the computer, which has leads attached
   with banana clips to various parts of the control console.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala have their hands on top of their heads.]

     DANIEL
     You're making a big mistake. More Ori ships will be here soon.

     VALA

     (agreeing)
     Umm hmm.

     JAFFA
     Then they will suffer the same fate.

     ADRIA

     (not visible)
     I think not.

   [Vala and Daniel look around without moving their heads. Suddenly the
   weapons are ripped from the hands of the three Jaffa. The Jaffa grab
   their throats, gasping, apparently unable to breathe. They are lifted
   off the ground, still gasping. Suddenly they fall to the ground,
   unconscious. After a moment, Adria enters the room from the corridor.]

     VALA
     Adria?

     VALA
     Hello, Mother.

   [Daniel quickly kneels, grabs a zat gun, and aims it at Adria. She
   pulls it from his hands with her mind then levitates a staff weapon and
   points it at him. He grabs his throat as if he can't breathe.]

     VALA
     Okay! We all know darling that you have telekinetic powers. You can
     stop showing off now!

   [Daniel holds his throat while staring at the tip of the staff weapon.
   Adria releases her hold on the staff, and it drops to the floor. Daniel
   continues holding his throat, but he appears able to breathe.]

     ADRIA

     (stepping toward Vala)
     I've missed you, Mother. They said I should forget about you. That
     you'd abandoned me because you didn't care.

     VALA
     No.

     ADRIA

     (smiling)
     I knew you'd come back for me.

     VALA
     How is it that you're even alive? Everyone else on the planet was
     killed.

     ADRIA

     (touching the large pendant on her necklace)
     I was saved by this. It holds a piece of the holy city of Celestis.
     It protects me, keeps me safe.

     VALA
     Oh.

     ADRIA
     Soon the other ships will come for us. And once we're back with the
     fleet, I promise you, Mother, we'll never be separated again.

   [Adria hugs Vala, who looks troubled.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

   [Bo'rel surveys the items they have taken from Teal'c and Mitchell. He
   picks up what appears to be a grenade. He walks around the room as he
   speaks to Mitchell. Teal'c sits silent.]

     BO'REL
     There are some who hold the Tau'ri in great esteem for the
     assistance they provided us against the Goa'uld.

     MITCHELL
     I'm guessing you're not one of them?

     BO'REL
     While I recognize the contributions made, I question the motive. I
     suspect it had more to do with self-preservation than generosity. We
     had a common enemy. And as much as the Tau'ri would have us believe
     that we could not have defeated the Goa'uld without them, I know
     better.

   [He has set down the grenade and picked up the C-4 remote detonator.]

     BO'REL
     What is this device?

     MITCHELL

     (after a pause)
     Haven't got a clue.

   [Bo'rel pushes a button that turns on the detonator. Mitchell makes
   himself look away.]

   INT--POWER GENERATION ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

   [The detonators on the C-4 bricks start flashing and beeping in time.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

   [Mitchell sits facing forward, expressionless.]

     BO'REL
     I will not ask you again.

   [Mitchell starts to say something, then stops himself.]

     MITCHELL
     Nope, still nothin'.

   [Bo'rel lifts the guard off of the detonation switch and is about to
   push it. Teal'c draws himself up but says nothing.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter continues working on her laptop. Suddenly the ship powers down,
   and the lights go off.]

     CARTER
     Yes!

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Adria is holding Vala's hands. Daniel is still frozen with his hands
   to his throat. Vala and Adria look up in surprise at the dark, quiet
   ship.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

     BO'REL
     Find out what's happening!

   [He puts the detonator back on the table.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter picks up her machine gun and flashlight and starts to leave.
   She turns back, aiming her flashlight at the Prior staff on the raised
   platform. She walks over picks it up.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     VALA
     Listen, we're not rejoining the fleet. You're coming with me.

     ADRIA

     (pulling her hands away)
     No, I can't abandon my army.

     VALA
     It's not your army.

     ADRIA
     Of course it is.

     VALA
     Well, as your mother I'm putting my foot down. You're too young to
     have your own army.

     ADRIA
     They look to me for guidance, for protection, and for answers.

   [She turns her gaze to Daniel.]

     ADRIA
     Tell me what happened to my people here on this planet.

   [Daniel's arms are released. He looks up at her. He refuses to answer,
   but his body shakes with the effort to resist telling her as she tries
   to pull the information from him.]

     VALA
     No, d-don't. He doesn't know anything!

   [Daniel continues to resist while Adria stares at him intensely.]

     VALA
     Adria!

   [Adria releases her mental hold. Daniel gasps and falls back off of his
   knees. He takes several breaths, touching his throat.]

     ADRIA

     (to Daniel)
     You have a strong mind.

   [Vala kneels beside Daniel. Adria walks by Daniel and looks down at the
   Jaffa on the floor. Vala helps Daniel stand up behind Adria.]

     ADRIA
     Wake up, Jaffa!

   [The young Jaffa wakes up, surprised. Adria smiles at him.]

     ADRIA
     Welcome back.

   [He gets to his feet, but is still having trouble breathing. She lifts
   him off the floor with her mind.]

     ADRIA
     Now, tell me. What happened to the believers who came to spread
     Origin to this world?

   [The Jaffa struggles but doesn't answer.]

     ADRIA
     Yours is a backward people. Too primitive to have created such an
     effective weapon. So tell me, how did it come into your hands?

   [The Jaffa still won't answer.]

     ADRIA

     (insistent)
     Where is it?

     VALA

     (stepping forward)
     Stop it.

   [Adria pushes Vala back into Daniel's arms telekinetically.]

     ADRIA
     Don't interfere, Mother!

   [Vala is in some pain.]

     ADRIA
     Where, Jaffa?

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, ORI WARSHIP

   [The room is lit only by torchlight. Bo'rel paces nervously. Mitchell
   and Teal'c exchange looks. A Jaffa hears something and turns toward the
   doorway. Suddenly Carter appears in the open doorway. She hits the
   Jaffa guard with the Prior staff. Teal'c and Mitchell stand and begin
   fighting other Jaffa. They hit and zat the Jaffa, neutralizing them
   all.]

     MITCHELL
     I didn't know you knew how to use one of those things.

     CARTER
     Well, piece of cake.

   [They begin to gather their supplies and weapons from the table.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     ADRIA
     Where is the weapon?

     JAFFA

     (struggling)
     Da- Dakara.

   [Adria tilts her head quickly, and the Jaffa's neck breaks in response.
   Vala and Daniel look on, horrified.]

     ADRIA
     Dakara.

   EXT--TEMPLE ON DAKARA, DAY

   INT--PLANNING ROOM ON DAKARA

     LANDRY
     If you continue to use this weapon in violation of our previous
     agreement, our alliance is in jeopardy.

     SE'TAK
     And what does this alliance do to benefit the Jaffa?

     BRA'TAC
     If it were not for the Tau'ri, we would still be slaves to the
     Goa'uld!

     SE'TAK

     That was in the past. Now we face a much more dangerous enemy. And
     every day while we lose ground to the Ori, the Tau'ri homeworld
     remains curiously untouched.
     (stepping toe to toe with Landry)
     We are the ones fighting this battle. We are the ones dying by the
     thousands.

     LANDRY
     And yet you choose to test your new toy on a human world, not on one
     of a dozen Jaffa planets that have fallen to the Ori. Why is that,
     exactly?

     SE'TAK
     This discussion is over.

   [Se'tak steps away. Landry and Bra'tac exchange unhappy looks.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Carter, Teal'c, and Mitchell are walking, lighting their way in the
   dark corridor with their flashlights.]

     CARTER
     The Odyssey tried to beam us out of here but somehow the shields had
     been activated. At first I thought it was something I had done, but
     after checking the controls I realized it wasn't me.

     MITCHELL
     There's someone else on board.

     CARTER
     Three motherships are in orbit over the planet. The Odyssey had to
     retreat in order to avoid being detected.

     TEAL'C
     Then the Stargate is our only means of escape.

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Jackson, Vala, come in.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel, Vala, and Adria hear the radio transmissions.]

   over the ship.]

   into a large conduit.]

   and look around.]

     MITCHELL

   [They are stopped by two armed Jaffa in front of them. Se'tak and other
   Jaffa approach them from behind.]

     BRA'TAC
     What is the meaning of this?

     SE'TAK

     (reaching them)
     We just received word. The Ori ship has taken flight.

     CARTER
     I might be able to override primary systems from the control room.

     Scans are detecting no transmitter signals on the surface of the

     EMERSON
     Well if they had, Stargate Command would have given us the heads up
     by now. No, it's more likely they're still on that ship.

     MARKS
     Sir, if that's the case, and it's on its way to rendezvous with the
     rest of the Ori fleet, we've lost them.

     EMERSON
     Maybe not. We still may have a shot at rescuing SG-1 provided that
     ship is headed where I think it is. Major, set a course for Dakara.

   [Marks complies.]

   INT--PLANNING ROOM ON DAKARA

     SE'TAK
     The Ori ship destroyed three Ha'tak vessels before jumping into
     hyperspace.

     LANDRY
     I'm sorry to hear that.

     SE'TAK

     (circling around to stand next to Landry)
     The Jaffa on the planet reported no gate activity, no other ships in
     the vicinity. Nor were there any survivors after the initial attack.
     Not a single soldier of the Ori was left alive.

     LANDRY
     What's your point?

     SE'TAK
     The only other people on board that ship were from Stargate Command.

     BRA'TAC
     You cannot possibly think the Tau'ri are responsible for this!

     SE'TAK
     What other explanation is there?

     LANDRY
     We're not in the habit of conducting sneak attacks on our allies,
     however much we may disagree with their tactics.

     SE'TAK
     You were jealous of the power we command through the Ancient device.
     You sought to redress that imbalance by taking the Ori ship. When
     the Ha'taks stood in your way, they were swept aside.

     BRA'TAC

     (intensely)
     Se'tak, this is madness.

     SE'TAK

     We shall see.
     (to the Jaffa)
     Guard them!

   [Se'tak walks swiftly out, and the two Jaffa guards bar the way of
   Bra'tac and Landry with staff weapons.]

   They open a door and enter.]

     MITCHELL
     Here's a question. Who's flyin' this boat?

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     ADRIA
     I know Tomin will be happy to see you again.

     VALA

     (amazed)
     Tomin's alive? He wasn't on the planet with you?

     ADRIA
     No, I've been traveling with various ships. As the leader of this
     great enlightenment, it's important that I make my presence known.
     Especially now when the first inroads are being made. Once the rest
     of the fleet arrives, I'll have a much harder time of it.

     DANIEL
     How many other ships are coming?

     ADRIA
     Many, many more. By my estimation, the galaxy will be converted
     within the year.

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter is once again working on the console with her laptop.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Jackson, come in... Jackson, Vala, can you hear me?

   [There is only static in response.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Teal'c)
     We're gonna have to go out there and look for them.
     (to Carter)
     Sam?

     CARTER
     I'll keep at it.

   [Mitchell and Teal'c leave.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Teal'c search room by room. They come around a corner and
   face three Jaffa with their staff weapons aimed. They raise their
   machine guns in response.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, at least it's not raining.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     ADRIA
     I don't know why you're complaining. You should be delighted. As the
     mother of the Orici you will be revered by all the followers of
     Origin.

     VALA
     Well, while I appreciate the celebrity status, I have to admit it
     would get very tiresome very quickly, especially if I had to perform
     for the-- for the masses. I'm not very good with crowds.

     ADRIA
     There'll be no demands made on you. All you have to do is accept
     Origin into your heart.

     VALA
     That could be a problem.

     ADRIA
     Perhaps at first, but eventually you will embrace the truth.

     VALA
     I don't think so.

     ADRIA

     (angry and a bit desperate)
     You're my mother. If I am unable convince you, how can I be expected
     to sway the countless worlds in this galaxy? Until I have brought
     you into the fold, my mission here is a failure.

     VALA
     I can be very stubborn.

     DANIEL

     (agreeing)
     Um hmm.

     ADRIA
     Then I'll be... patient and very... determined.

     DANIEL
     What about all the other people that refuse to bow down to the will
     of the Ori. Are you gonna show them the same courtesy?

     ADRIA
     There is a limit to my patience.

     DANIEL
     And there's a difference between devotion and blind submission. You
     can't expect to win the faith of your followers through fear and
     intimidation.

     ADRIA
     What would you have me do?

     DANIEL
     Give people a choice.

     ADRIA
     I'm trying to bring an entire galaxy from darkness into light. In
     order to do that, all doubt must be removed or it will spread like a
     cancer. It's that simple.

   [She stares at Daniel in a challenging way, and he meets her gaze.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Teal'c face off against Bo'rel and two other Jaffa.]

     MITCHELL
     This is getting a little old, don't you think?

     BO'REL
     You will turn this ship back immediately.

     MITCHELL
     Love to. Unfortunately, we're not the ones flying it.

     BO'REL
     You lie!

   [Teal'c lowers his weapon and steps forward.]

     TEAL'C
     Would you accuse me of lying as well? We are unaware of who is in
     control of this vessel but suspect they may be on board with us. We
     in fact share a common enemy.

     MITCHELL
     Whatever's between us? We can finish that later. Right now we have
     to re-take this ship.

   [After a moment, the Jaffa lower and deactivate their staff weapons.
   Bo'rel sighs.]

     MITCHELL
     That's more like it.

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     VALA
     Adria, listen to me--

     ADRIA
     I'm sorry, Mother, the time for talking is over. We've arrived.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR DAKARA

   [The ship exits hyperspace near Dakara.]

   INT--ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP

   [Mitchell and Teal'c enter a room with a viewscreen. Through it they
   see the planet below, very near.]

     MITCHELL
     Is that what I think it is?

     TEAL'C
     Dakara.

   INT--PLANNING ROOM ON DAKARA

   [Se'tak enters.]

     SE'TAK
     My suspicions have been confirmed.

     LANDRY
     What are you talking about?

     SE'TAK
     The Ori ship has arrived. You would try to force us to give up the
     Ancient device rather than have us wield its power.

     LANDRY

     (adamant)
     I'm telling you my people are not responsible for this.

     SE'TAK
     We will gather our fleet and lay siege to your world. We will take
     back the Ori ship and avenge our fallen brothers.

   [They stare each other down.]

   INT--ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP

   [Teal'c gazes out the window, distressed.]

     MITCHELL
     You don't think that whoever's flying this boat is on a friendly
     trip, do you?

   [Teal'c barely moves his head, as if annoyed at the question.]

     MITCHELL
     No, me neither.

     TEAL'C
     With the engines activated, there may be a significantly greater
     reaction to the C-4.

   [Mitchell pulls out the detonator and turns it on.]

     TEAL'C
     The ship may well be destroyed.

     MITCHELL

     (holding up the detonator)
     Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

     TEAL'C

     (stepping toward Mitchell)
     We must not allow this ship to launch an attack.

     MITCHELL
     Right.

   [Mitchell lifts the trigger guard and puts his thumb on the switch
   beneath it.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DAKARA

   [The Ori warship is moving slowly, apparently entering orbit around the
   planet.]

   INT--ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP

   [Mitchell hesitates to throw the switch, his eyes closed for a moment.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell?

     MITCHELL
     I was just trying to think of some appropriate last words.

   [Teal'c growls but says nothing. After a moment, Mitchell cringes and
   throws the switch. Nothing happens. Teal'c looks at Mitchell in
   surprise.]

     MITCHELL
     What happened?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I know. Why not?

   [Mitchell begins re-trying the switch over and over.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

     ADRIA

     (turning to face Daniel and Vala)
     You should thank me. I just saved your lives.

     VALA
     What are you talking about?

   [A Jaffa comes to the door, pointing a staff weapon at Adria. She rips
   the weapon from him and throws him backward into the corridor. She
   closes the door on two more Jaffa.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR DAKARA

   [The Odyssey exits hyperspace and moves toward the Ori warship.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

     EMERSON

     (over radio)
     SG-1, this is Odyssey, do you read?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Odyssey, this is Colonel Carter.

     EMERSON

     (over radio)
     We're going to try and beam you out of there.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     It won't work. The shield is still active. I'm trying to shut it
     down. Please stand ready.

   [She goes back to the console.]

   INT--ANCIENT WEAPON CONTROL ROOM ON DAKARA

   [Se'tak, Landry, Bra'tac and other Jaffa enter the room. The Ancient
   control station is there.]

     SE'TAK
     The weapon is capable of firing through a gate, but it is also
     capable of releasing a wave that will encompass this world and
     beyond, wiping out all life forms on any ships that happen to be in
     planetary orbit. We will be perfectly safe here within the shield
     chamber.

   [A Jaffa begins pushing on the large control blocks.]

     SE'TAK
     You will survive to bear witness. The Jaffa have finally taken their
     rightful place as a true power in this galaxy.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Bo'rel and two other Jaffa fire their staff weapons at the door to
   Adria's chamber.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Adria stoically watches the staff blasts hit the other side of the
   door.]

     DANIEL
     It won't be that easy.

     ADRIA
     Why wouldn't it be? I'm about to destroy the only real threat
     against us.

     DANIEL
     You're forgetting about someone. What about the Ancients?

     ADRIA

     (smiling)
     You know as well as I do they'll never get involved. We have free
     reign in this galaxy.

     VALA

     (stepping forward)
     Adria, listen to me. I promise to stay with you. I'll hear you out
     on the whole Origin thing. I'll even try and keep an open mind. Just
     let everyone else go.

     ADRIA

     (turning her head toward the door)
     It's too late for them.
     (turning back to Vala)
     But don't worry, I'll be keeping him alive.

   [She turns her gaze to Daniel.]

     ADRIA
     We have plans for you.

   [Daniel stares at her worriedly.]

   INT--ANCIENT WEAPON CONTROL ROOM ON DAKARA

   [The Jaffa pushes two more blocks, then stops.]

     JAFFA
     We are ready.

     LANDRY

     (stepping forward)
     My people may be on board that ship!

   [Other Jaffa threaten him.]

     SE'TAK
     Not for much longer. Fire the weapon.

   [The Jaffa nods and pushes the block near him. Landry is angry but
   unable to do anything.]

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   [The Ancient weapon begins to activate, rising out of the top of the
   mountain.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter is typing furiously into her laptop while looking at schematics
   of the ship on a large monitor. The monitor refreshes then shows the
   shield is down.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Odyssey we're good to go!

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     EMERSON
     Get them the hell out of there.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   [Emerson rushes to sit in his command chair.]

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   [The weapon emanates a wave that begins to travel across the surface of
   the planet.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel and Vala are beamed out. Adria looks around in question.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [All of SG-1 and Vala beam onto the bridge.]

     EMERSON
     Now!

   EXT--SPACE NEAR DAKARA

   [The Odyssey turns and moves quickly, then enters hyperspace. The wave
   approaches and encompasses the Ori warship.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [The wave reaches the Jaffa standing in the corridor.]

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [The wave passes across the floor in front of Adria, destroying the
   bodies of the dead Jaffa. It then travels through her, with no apparent
   affect.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR DAKARA

   [The Ori warship begins firing energy weapons very precisely at one
   point on Dakara.]

   INT--ANCIENT WEAPON CONTROL ROOM ON DAKARA

   [The room is under attack. Pieces of the ceiling fall to the floor.]

     SE'TAK
     What happened?

     JAFFA
     The weapon appears to have had no effect.

   [The room continues to be hit, the ceiling crumbing and the room
   shaking.]

     BRA'TAC

     (grabbing Landry by the arm)
     Come, come!

   [Bra'tac and Landry rush out.]

   INT--CORRIDOR IN TEMPLE OF DAKARA

   [Landry and Bra'tac make their way through.]

     BRA'TAC
     The area was evacuated. The gate is unguarded.

   INT--ANCIENT WEAPON CONTROL ROOM ON DAKARA

     SE'TAK
     Fire again!

   [The Jaffa starts to move the blocks.]

     SE'TAK
     Fire the weapon!

   EXT--DAKARA, DAY

   [The Stargate is active. Bra'tac and Landry run up to the event
   horizon. They turn to see the Ori energy weapons hitting the Ancient
   weapon, blowing the mountain apart. They turn and enter the wormhole.]

   [The attack continues, and the weapon is completely destroyed, raining
   debris upon the planet.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c and Carter enter from the stairs. Landry, Mitchell, and Bra'tac
   are seated at the table. Daniel and Vala look out onto the gate room.]

     TEAL'C
     There is news. A cargo ship dispatched to the area has reported
     complete and utter devastation. Dakara is no more.

   [Bra'tac turns away in distress.]

     CARTER
     Meanwhile we received word that five more planets have fallen to the
     Ori, including Hebridan and Langara. So far we haven't heard
     anything from our allies on either world.

     MITCHELL
     We are gettin' our asses whooped. And it looks like that Merlin
     device is the only shot we have a stopping them.

     LANDRY
     Then find it! Dismissed.

   [Landry stands and leaves. Carter touches Teal'c's shoulder then
   leaves.]

     BRA'TAC
     The council is in disarray. The Jaffa nation is fractured. And
     without Dakara to bring us all together, I fear everything we have
     fought for all these years will be lost.

     TEAL'C
     The war is not over, old friend.

     BRA'TAC
     If only I could have done more to oppose Se'tak.

     VALA
     There's nothing to be gained by second guessing yourself. You can't
     remake the past, so look ahead... or risk being left behind.

   [As she speaks, Bra'tac looks at Vala as if he is finally taking notice
   of her. She leaves.]

     BRA'TAC
     She displays the wisdom of a battle-seasoned warrior.

   [Teal'c hums in agreement.]

     DANIEL
     She's a mother. Close enough.

   FADE OUT
