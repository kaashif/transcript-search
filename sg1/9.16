   SCENES FROM 9.04 "THE TIES THAT BIND"

   EXT-SPACE

   [A large group of al'kesh face a small cargo ship.]

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     Unfortunately, that ship is now in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry stands at the end of the table. Daniel sits next to Vala.
   Mitchell and Teal'c sit across the table from them.]

     LANDRY
     The who?

     VALA
     It's a coalition of former smugglers and mercenaries who've banded
     together to take advantage of the power vacuum left by the demise of
     the Goa'uld.

   SCENES FROM 9.06 "BEACHHEAD"

   INT--SGC RECREATION ROOM

   [Mitchell leans forward and tries to catch his breath from his
   exertions. Teal'c and the others gather around Landry, who holds their
   basketball.]

     LANDRY
     We received a communique from a Goa'uld named Nerus. Ring any bells?

     TEAL'C
     He is a Goa'uld known for his many...appetites.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-3 and Nerus, wearing a Greco-Roman robe, arrive through the active
   Stargate.]

   INT--SGC VIP ROOM

   [The room has been decorated with Greco-Roman busts, ivy and other
   artwork. A large dining table is in the center of the room, filled with
   silver bowls and platters of fruits and cheeses. A three dimensional
   holographic image of Kallana rotates a foot above the table.]

     NERUS
     I was the one who figured out how to activate all of the Stargates
     in the galaxy at once! Didn't Ba'al mention that?

   [Teal'c and Vala exchange looks.]

   INT--SGC BRIG

     LANDRY

     (moving uncomfortably close to Nerus)
     You will descend, to a small, dark room, in the basement of Area 51,
     and you'll stay there till you come up with a defense against the
     Ori.

     NERUS

     (shaking his head in amused disbelief)
     What would possibly compel me to do that?

     LANDRY
     Hunger.

   [Nerus looks at Landry and gulps in shock.]

   EXT--FOREST, P6G-452, DAY

   [SG-1, wearing leather garb, run through a forest, exchanging automatic
   weapons fire with their pursuers. They pause and take cover by some
   trees. Carter hands Mitchell an automatic weapon which he primes to
   fire.]

     CARTER
     What did you say to them?

     MITCHELL
     Look, obviously it didn't go so well.

   [Daniel runs ahead into a clearing where the Stargate is located and
   takes cover behind a rock near the DHD.]

     TEAL'C

     (shouting over the gunfire)
     I did advise that you were a most unlikely drug smuggler, Colonel
     Mitchell.

     MITCHELL

     (exasperated)
     Can we please just fall back to the Gate?

   [They continue to exchange fire with their pursuers as they retreat to
   Daniel's position, who is firing his weapon to give them some cover
   fire. Once Carter takes his place, Daniel moves ahead and starts
   dialing the DHD from a crouched position. The pursuers continue to
   advance, taking refuge by the trees where SG-1 once hid.]

     TEAL'C
     We cannot hold this position.

   [Daniel dials several glyphs, but before he can activate the wormhole,
   it disappears as if beamed using an Asgard transporter. Daniel looks
   stunned. The leader of the pursuers also stares in shock. The rest of
   SG-1 is focused on defending themselves and did not see the Stargate
   disappear behind them.]

     CARTER

     (to Daniel, without turning)
     What's taking so long?

     DANIEL

     (shocked)
     Guys?!?

   [The DHD is beamed away.]

     DANIEL

     (panicked)
     We got a problem!

     MITCHELL
     Yes! Bad men are shooting at us! Just hurry up and open the damn...

   [Mitchell turns around and sees Daniel crouched in the open with no DHD
   or Stargate in sight. The pursuers have stopped firing. So have SG-1.
   Teal'c and Carter turn around and exchange surprised and concerned
   looks.]

     MITCHELL

     (stunned)
     ...Gate.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   EIGHT HOURS EARLIER

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Reynolds and SG-1 sit with Landry. An ear of corn in a cylinder
   labeled "Biohazardous Containment Unit" has been set on the table while
   Reynolds briefs the group.]

     REYNOLDS
     It's called Kassa.

     MITCHELL
     Looks a lot like corn.

     DANIEL
     Which I always thought was indigenous to North America.

     MITCHELL
     Must be pretty damn tasty if it's causing all this fuss.

     REYNOLDS
     I believe Lieutenant Mooney described it as "sweet corn heaven."

     LANDRY
     What's his condition?

     REYNOLDS
     He's still craving it, sir. He didn't even want to leave the planet.
     I had to restrain him to get him back here.

     DANIEL
     That's amazing.

     MITCHELL
     Obviously you've never had my grandma's corn bread and black-eyed
     peas.

   [Daniel and Teal'c look at Mitchell oddly.]

     DANIEL
     No. Um, what about the rest of the population? Were they
     demonstrating any of the same addictive behaviors?

     REYNOLDS

     Everybody was fine when we first got there. A fight broke out in the
     marketplace when supplies ran low, and my men and I had to move in
     to restore order. That's what made Mooney want to taste it in the
     first place.
     (forcing composure)
     I...just didn't think it would...

     LANDRY
     It's all right. What does Doctor Lee have to say about it?

     CARTER
     He's still analyzing the sample now, sir, to determine whether or
     not it's naturally occurring.

     DANIEL

     (thinking aloud)
     Which makes me wonder if the Ori have something to do with this.

     MITCHELL

     (making a skeptical face)
     Get all the population Jonesing for space corn? I don't know.

     TEAL'C
     I also do not believe that to be likely.

     DANIEL
     I guess it doesn't really fit their M.O., does it?

     REYNOLDS
     Besides, there was no evidence that a Prior had ever been there
     before.

     TEAL'C
     In the last session of the interim council, several Jaffa leaders
     complained of erratic behavior on several planets. We did not
     suspect tampering with the food supply.

     LANDRY
     Colonel, were you able to determine where this Kassa came from?

     REYNOLDS
     Aah. I pressured one of the vendors for a Gate address, but to be
     honest, I don't know if it's accurate.

     MITCHELL
     It's worth checking out, sir.

     LANDRY
     Well, find out what you can, but try and stay under the radar.

     MITCHELL
     Will do.

   EXT--SPACE, WORMHOLE PASSAGE

   EXT--P6G-452, DAY

   [Several fields of Kassa are spread out on the planet.]

   EXT--KASSA FIELD P6G-452, DAY

   [A farmer pulls his cart along a path by Kassa fields. He stops for a
   moment and glances furtively around. He then pulls off an ear of corn
   and starts eating it. Behind him, SG-1 rises from where they have been
   hidden among the stalks and watches him. They are dressed in
   earth-toned, leather clothing. Mitchell pulls a blade of grass out from
   between his teeth. They step out onto the path.]

     MITCHELL
     Taste testing the produce, huh?

   [The farmer turns, frightened.]

     FARMER
     Please, I have two daughters.

     CARTER
     Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.

     FARMER
     Who are you? What do you want?

     MITCHELL
     We're looking to buy some Kassa.

     FARMER
     It is available at every market.

     MITCHELL

     (fidgeting)
     We're looking for a sizeable quantity.

     FARMER
     I can maybe spare you one or two carts full.

     MITCHELL
     Ah. How much for the whole field?

   [Carter gives Mitchell a concerned look.]

     FARMER

     (suspicious)
     This is not the way the Alliance does business.

     DANIEL
     As in the Lucian Alliance?

     MITCHELL

     (through his teeth to Daniel)
     How many alliances do we know?

     TEAL'C
     Many.

     FARMER
     The Lucian Alliance will know you have come. They have eyes
     everywhere!

     MITCHELL
     Great. Because we're looking to set up a meeting. Maybe you can
     arrange that.

     FARMER
     Worrel returns this afternoon.

     DANIEL
     Worrel is...?

     FARMER
     This is his land, his crop. He lives in a house just up the road.

   [The farmer points further up the path.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, tell him Mister Shaft would like to meet with him. Any
     specific time, or should I just block off the whole afternoon?

   [Carter shifts uncomfortably, clearly unhappy with Mitchell.]

     FARMER
     I will arrange it, but I must warn you. He will not take kindly to
     your request, or to your presence.

   [The farmer pushes his cart down the path quickly. SG-1 remain standing
   in the dirt road, three of them glaring at Mitchell.]

     DANIEL

     (clearing his throat)
     What the hell was that?

     MITCHELL

     (innocently)
     What was what?

     CARTER
     We're supposed to stay under the radar.

     TEAL'C
     I doubt if this world possesses such technology.

     MITCHELL
     See, when he's right, he's right.

     DANIEL
     Sam has a point. We're not equipped to take these guys on right now.

     MITCHELL
     I have no intention of taking anybody on. I'm just going to pose as
     a buyer.

     DANIEL

     (skeptically)
     You?

     MITCHELL
     Well, no offense, Jackson, but you do not strike me as the drug
     dealer type. In fact, you're not even close.

     DANIEL

     (scoffing)
     I think I'm as close as you are!

     CARTER

     (flustered, to Mitchell)
     Come on! You're miles away.

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c, which one of us is closer?

     TEAL'C

     (studying them)
     I believe the three of you to be equidistant.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, please! Mary Poppins is not even in the running.

     CARTER

     (very insulted)
     Hey!

     MITCHELL

     (to Teal'c)
     And neither are you, because I'm going. I'm just going to ask some
     questions about the operation, find out what I can, tell them their
     price is too high, and then high tail it out of there.

   [Mitchell saunters away, the rest of SG-1 exchange skeptical looks
   before following.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Daniel, Teal'c, and Carter lie flat on the ground at the edge of the
   rise, watching Mitchell in the clearing below with binoculars. He is
   lounging on the back of a hay cart, just outside Worrel's encampment.]

     CARTER
     This was a bad idea.

     DANIEL
     It's been four hours now. When do we call this thing?

   [Carter is about to respond, then notices something and raises the
   binoculars to her face again. Daniel follows suit. They see Worrel, the
   farmer, and a large group of imposing men heading towards Mitchell.]

     TEAL'C
     They are heavily armed.

   EXT--AREA OUTSIDE WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

     FARMER

     (pointing to Mitchell nervously)
     This is the man I told you about. Mister Shaft.

   [Mitchell gets up lazily.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey. You must be Worrel.

     WORREL
     Where are your friends, Mister?

     MITCHELL
     I figured you'd rather deal one on one. Call me Shaft.

     WORREL
     Who told you Kassa was grown here?

     MITCHELL
     In my business, you get to know the right people.

     WORREL
     What right people?

     MITCHELL
     You know, the good, hard working type that tell you what you know,
     then disappear.

   [Worrel signals to his men and a few groups break off to search the
   surrounding area. SG-1 observes this from their position on the rise
   above.]

     WORREL

     (to the farmer)
     You can go.

   [The farmer hurries away.]

     WORREL
     We'll talk inside.

     MITCHELL
     Great.

   EXT--RISE ABOVE WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [The rest of SG-1 watch through binoculars as Mitchell and Worrel's
   group head to a small fortified structure. Mitchell gives a thumbs-up
   sign behind his back.]

     TEAL'C
     If we remain here, we will be discovered.

     CARTER
     Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Worrel opens the gate, and they step inside. Once in the courtyard,
   Worrel signals his men, and they begin to frisk Mitchell.]

     MITCHELL

     (chuckling)
     Fellas...do you think I'd carry a weapon?

     WORREL
     Enough. All right, Mister, what can I do for you?

     MITCHELL
     I represent a coalition of seven planets with a combined population
     of thirty million Kassa hungry souls. We're looking for a supplier.

     WORREL
     I don't have that kind of inventory.

     MITCHELL
     Well, nobody does. That's why I need more than one. So, if you could
     just refer me...?

     WORREL
     Refer you?

     MITCHELL
     Higher up.

     WORREL
     So you wish to speak to my superior?

     MITCHELL
     I think our needs are big enough to warrant his attention.

     WORREL
     Your needs?

   [Worrel signals his men. They grab Mitchell by the upper arms and shove
   him to one side.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Daniel and Carter see Worrel's men grab Mitchell by the arms and pull
   him out of sight. They move the binoculars away from their faces,
   looking worried.]

     CARTER
     Ooh, that didn't look good.

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Worrel's men strong arm Mitchell onto a long wooden bench. A wooden
   rail serves as the back of it. Mitchell is forced to sit, his arms
   stretched out across the railing and held there by the men.]

     WORREL
     Just exactly who do you think you are?

     MITCHELL

     (grunting in pain)
     I already told you my name.

     WORREL
     Mister?

     MITCHELL
     Actually, it's just Shaft. "Mister" is more of a courtesy title. So
     if you could just pass it along to your superiors, that's all I'm
     asking.

     WORREL
     I'm forced to wonder what someone like yourself, a businessman
     representing...how many planets did you say again?

     MITCHELL
     Seven. But one of 'em is actually a moon, so...

     WORREL
     So, thirty million potential customers, and you need me to arrange a
     meeting with my superior.

     MITCHELL
     See, now, you're selling yourself short.

   [Worrel and his aide unholster their weapons and point them at
   Mitchell.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Using binoculars, the rest of SG-1 see Worrel and his aide aiming
   their weapons.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I think he's in trouble.

   [Teal'c turns to one side and sees some of Worrel's men approaching
   their hiding place.]

     TEAL'C
     As are we.

   [As one, the three back off of the ridge.]

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [Mitchell chuckles without humor as Worrel points his weapon at him.]

   EXT--FOREST, P6G-452, DAY

   [SG-1 run through a forest, exchanging automatic weapons fire with
   Worrel's men. They pause and take cover by some trees. Carter hands
   Mitchell a weapon, which he primes.]

     CARTER
     What did you say to them?

     MITCHELL
     Look, obviously it didn't go so well.

   [Daniel runs ahead into a clearing where the Stargate is located and
   takes cover behind a rock near the DHD. The others continue to exchange
   fire with their pursuers as they retreat to Daniel's position, who is
   firing his weapon to give them some cover fire. Once Carter takes his
   place, Daniel moves ahead and starts dialing the DHD from a crouched
   position. Worrel and his men continue to advance, taking refuge by the
   trees where SG-1 once hid.]

   [Daniel dials several glyphs, but before he can activate the wormhole,
   it disappears as if beamed using an Asgard transporter. Daniel looks
   stunned. Worrel also stares in shock. The rest of SG-1 is focused on
   defending themselves and did not see the Stargate disappear behind
   them.]

     DANIEL

     (shocked)
     Guys?!?

     CARTER

     (to Daniel, without turning)
     What's taking so long?

   [The DHD is beamed away.]

     DANIEL

     (panicked)
     We got a problem!

     MITCHELL
     Just hurry up and open the damn...

   [Mitchell turns around and sees Daniel crouched in the open with no DHD
   or Stargate in sight. Everyone stops firing their weapons. Teal'c and
   Carter turn around and exchange surprised and concerned looks.]

     MITCHELL

     (stunned)
     ...Gate. Okay, here's an obvious question...

     WORREL

     (yelling to SG-1)
     You're surrounded! Drop your weapons.

   [SG-1 look around and see other Lucian Alliance members showing
   themselves from positions all around the team. SG-1 slowly lower their
   weapons to the ground and stand, raising their hands in surrender.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry approaches Harriman, who is dialing the Stargate.]

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Four encoded.

     LANDRY
     Chief, how long are they overdue now?

     HARRIMAN
     Two hours, sir. Colonel Mitchell has never missed a check-in.
     Chevron Five encoded.

   [Reynolds approaches.]

     REYNOLDS
     General Landry, sir. I just spoke with Doctor Lee. He's determined
     the plant contains a highly addictive psycho-stimulant.

     LANDRY
     Which just confirms what we already knew.

     REYNOLDS
     But we didn't know it is engineered, which means it didn't evolve
     naturally.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Six encoded.

   [They all watch the Stargate finish dialing. Nothing happens.]

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Seven will not lock.

     LANDRY
     Why not?

     HARRIMAN
     I don't know, sir. I'm not showing any malfunction at this end.

     LANDRY
     Run a diagnostic, and try again.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452 , DAY

   [SG-1 sit on the bench where Mitchell was restrained earlier. All of
   them have their hands tied behind them. A leather strap is wrapped
   around each of their necks and then slipped over the wood beam that
   serves as the back of the bench, connecting to the bindings around
   their wrists. They exchange resigned looks with each other. Worrel
   approaches them.]

     WORREL
     The infamous SG-1.

     MITCHELL
     Everbody, this is Worrel.

     WORREL
     Trust me, Mister. You won't get the best of me again.

     MITCHELL

     Actually, it's Mitchell. Cameron Mitchell.
     (low to his teammates)
     I tried to explain the uh, "mister" thing. I don't think he gets it.

     WORREL
     How did you steal the Stargate?

     CARTER
     What?!?

     WORREL
     SG-1 shows up on my little backwater planet, and the Stargate
     vanishes? I'm not a fool.

     TEAL'C

     (drolly)
     Perhaps not. But we are not responsible.

     CARTER
     We were here on a reconnaissance mission.

     WORREL

     (skeptical)
     Oh. So you were done slaying system lords, and decided to move on to
     more pressing agricultural concerns?

     MITCHELL
     That's exactly it. Corn patrol.

   [Worrel backhands Mitchell hard.]

     MITCHELL
     Ow!

     DANIEL
     Uh, I have a question. Why would we make the Gate magically
     disappear before we had a chance to escape through it?

     WORREL
     Bad timing?

     DANIEL
     That-that's got to be the single stupidest thing I've ever heard!

     WORREL
     Do things always go according to plan in your world, Doctor Jackson?

   [Daniel pauses and exchanges looks with Mitchell.]

     DANIEL
     No. Not usually. No.

     WORREL
     Then I would guess this is another one of those times.

   [Daniel sighs heavily.]

     WORREL
     And until my Stargate is returned, things will continue to go wrong.

   [Worrel gives a signal to his men. SG-1 exchange worried looks.]

   INT-SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry and Harriman head up the small flight of stairs to the Control
   Room.]

     HARRIMAN
     We've made repeated attempts to connect, sir. There's no signal
     whatsoever. It's got to be a problem with the offworld Gate.

     LANDRY
     Get me Colonel Emerson on board the Odyssey.

     HARRIMAN

     (moving to his station)
     Yes, sir. Right away.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Emerson moves around the bridge, checking in with his crew and
   observing station readiness.]

     MARKS
     Sir, I have General Landry for you.

     EMERSON
     On screen.

   [Marks presses a button, and Landry appears on the side video screen.]

     LANDRY
     Colonel, how goes the shakedown?

     EMERSON
     90% of our primary systems are up and running, sir. Care to take a
     ride?

     LANDRY

     (over videolink)
     Another time. I just need you to tell me that your hyperdrive is
     part of that 90%. We've lost contact with SG-1. They were on
     P6G-452.

   [Emerson looks back at Marks, who punches some controls.]

     MARKS
     Estimate twenty-two hours, sir.

     EMERSON
     I wouldn't want to go into battle just yet, but I think we can reach
     452 and extract SG-1 inside of a day.

     LANDRY

     (over videolink)
     Glad to hear it.

     EMERSON
     I assume they have the new chip locator implants?

     LANDRY

     (over videolink)
     They were the first after the events on Tegalus.

     EMERSON
     I can't think of a better first operational mission for the Odyssey
     than to bring home SG-1.

     LANDRY

     (over videolink)
     Neither can I, Colonel. Good luck.

     EMERSON
     Thank you, sir.

     LANDRY

     (over videolink)
     Landry out.

   [The video communication cuts off. Emerson moves to the captain's chair
   and sits.]

     EMERSON
     Major (sic.) Marks, set a course for P6G-452.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   [Emerson keys the ship's intercom from his chair.]

     EMERSON

     Attention all decks, this is Emerson. Prepare to engage hyperdrive.
     (to Marks)
     Take us out.

     MARKS
     With pleasure, sir.

   EXT--SPACE, AROUND EARTH

   [Odyssey moves out of Earth's orbit and enters hyperspace.]

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [One of Worrel's men punches Daniel hard in the face, drawing blood. He
   shakes his fist out afterwards. All of SG-1 look similarly battered.]

     DANIEL

     (biting off his words)
     Gah! Seriously! Why would we take the Stargate away before we had a
     chance to escape through it?
     (angrily, to Mitchell)
     And don't say bad timing.

     WORREL

     (calmly)
     Are things continuing to go wrong for you, Doctor Jackson? It's
     within your power to change that.

     MITCHELL
     Torturing us is not going to get you the answer you're looking for.

     WORREL
     I don't want to torture you. In fact, if you tell me the location of
     the Stargate, I'm prepared to release you.

     MITCHELL

     (exaggerating his incredulity)
     Oh, you are not! I can't-can you believe he just said that?

     CARTER
     You've already blown your chance. Whoever took your Stargate is long
     gone.

     TEAL'C
     And when your superiors discover that you have let the real thieves
     escape, it is you who will be tortured.

   [Worrel breathes heavily, looking slightly worried and very
   frustrated.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Landry sits at his desk, reading a report. Harriman stands before
   him.]

     LANDRY
     Someone is stealing Stargates?

     HARRIMAN
     Well, four that we know of, sir. According to the Tok'ra dispatch.

     LANDRY
     Which could explain why we haven't been able to dial 452 and contact
     SG-1.

     HARRIMAN
     Exactly, sir. In fact, the Trust tried this once with our Gate.

     LANDRY

     (standing)
     Isn't any Goa'uld mothership or similar class vessel capable of
     taking a Gate?

     HARRIMAN

     (shrugging)
     Not with Asgard beaming technology, which one eyewitness apparently
     confirmed is the method being used.

     LANDRY
     Send an encrypted databurst of all available intel to Colonel
     Emerson on board the Odyssey.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   [Harriman turns to go. Landry stops him.]

     LANDRY
     Oh, and Chief. Call Peterson Air Base. I need to take a little trip
     to Area 51.

     HARRIMAN
     Right away, sir.

   [Harriman leaves the office.]

   EXT--AREA 51, NEVADA, DAY

   INT--NERUS'S PRISON CELL, AREA 51

   [Nerus, wearing drab prison garb, sits at a small metal table in a
   cell. Another set of bars encloses the cell again. A buzzer sounds and
   Landry, wearing tan BDUs, enters the antechamber outside the double
   cell.]

     NERUS
     General. They told me you were coming, but I didn't believe them. I
     said, "I don't believe you."

   [A guard opens the outer cell door, and Landry enters.]

     LANDRY
     Well, here I am.

     NERUS

     (disappointed)
     You come to visit a condemned prisoner empty handed?

     LANDRY
     You're not a condemned prisoner, Nerus. But if you tell me what I
     need to know, I'll arrange a feast, the likes of which you have not
     seen since you set foot on this planet.

     NERUS

     (weakly)
     A feast?

     LANDRY
     I do not use the word lightly.

     NERUS
     Nor do I. How may I be of service, my dear General?

     LANDRY
     Someone out there is stealing Stargates. I need to know who, how,
     and why.

     NERUS

     (licking his lips)
     Stealing them?

     LANDRY
     Beamed right off the planets with Asgard technology as far as we
     know.

     NERUS
     Well, that must be maddening for you.

     LANDRY
     Ah. It is. I already have an idea who it might be.

     NERUS
     Well, if you're so smart, what do you need me for?

     LANDRY
     I have a theory. I still need some answers.

     NERUS
     But such a quandary must be worth more to you than a single,
     solitary, indulgent meal. Perhaps we could discuss my dietary
     requirements on a more permanent--

     LANDRY
     Every minute you waste trying to negotiate, I take one item off the
     menu.

   [Landry nods to the guard, and he signals the surveillance camera to
   open the outer cell door. It buzzes open.]

     NERUS

     (desperately)
     Can we talk over appetizers?

   [Landry pauses and looks back at Nerus impassively before leaving.]

     NERUS
     General?

   [Nerus scowls in thought.]

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [One of Worrel's men massages his hand as Mitchell spits out blood. His
   lip is swollen and split. The rest of SG-1 look exhausted, bloody, and
   in worse condition than before.]

     MITCHELL

     (to teammates)
     Look, for what it's worth, guys, sorry I dragged you into this.

     DANIEL

     (resigned)
     Oh, it happens all the time.

   [Worrel storms out of a building over to the restrained team.]

     MITCHELL

     (voice distorted from his swollen lip)
     Ah, my friend. You wear the furrowed brow of a deeply worried man.
     How's your day going?

   [He laughs, a bit "punch drunk" from the beatings.]

     WORREL
     We've been recalled by the Alliance.

     MITCHELL

     (chuckling maniacally)
     Well, you can't say we didn't tell you so.

     WORREL
     It is far worse news for you. I no longer have any reason to keep
     you alive.

     DANIEL

     (voice slurred)
     No. Wait. I-I-I can think of a reason.

   [Daniel pauses, visibly having trouble concentrating, and looks at his
   teammates for help.]

     CARTER

     (softly)
     We're more valuable alive.

     DANIEL
     Yes! We're more valuable alive. Good one.

   [Daniel tries to focus on Worrel with a hopeful expression. Carter nods
   to herself, sighing and looking haggard.]

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     WORREL
     No. My instructions were quite clear. Take care of Mister Shaft
     last. I want him to watch the others go first. Your deaths will
     serve as a warning to your people never to meddle with our
     operations in the future.

   [SG-1 exchange concerned looks. Worrel signals his men, and they all
   approach.]

   INT--NERUS'S PRISON CELL, AREA 51

   [Landry paces the outer cell as Nerus enjoys a turkey leg. Other dishes
   of food surround him.]

     NERUS
     General. This chicken is most plump and delicious. You spoil me,
     General.

     LANDRY
     It's called turkey.

   [He grabs a chair and carries it over close to Nerus's cell, sitting in
   it backwards.]

     NERUS
     Turkey?

     LANDRY
     Another rare delicacy.

     NERUS
     Well, I must have more turkey.

   [He laughs and picks up a soft pretzel.]

     NERUS
     What's this?

     LANDRY

     (ominously)
     I'm losing patience, Nerus.

     NERUS
     Well, you already know who it is.

     LANDRY
     So it is Ba'al.

     NERUS
     Of course it's Ba'al. Who else would it be?

     LANDRY
     Why is he doing it?

     NERUS

     (mouth full)
     You're the genius. You tell me.

     LANDRY

     (standing)
     Ah, maybe there's no need to go into the third and fourth courses.

     NERUS

     (panicking)
     No, General. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I meant that as the
     most sincere form of flattery. You are one of the more intelligent
     human beings I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. And I assure
     you, General, that this meal has just begun!

     LANDRY

     (smiling and sitting again)
     I'm glad to hear that.

   EXT--WORREL'S ENCAMPMENT, P6G-452, DAY

   [SG-1 braces themselves, resigned, as the guards aim their weapons at
   the team.]

     MITCHELL

     (desperately)
     Hey, the other three had nothing to do with this. I was running the
     operation.

     CARTER
     Cam...

     MITCHELL
     Worrel knows this! Tell him to get back here.

   [SG-1 is beamed off the bench as Worrel's men open fire. The Alliance
   members stare in shock at their captives' disappearance.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [SG-1, standing upright but still bound, appears in the center of the
   bridge. They stare at their new surroundings in shock. Emerson stands,
   taking in their battered condition.]

     EMERSON
     SG-1. I'm Colonel Paul Emerson. Welcome aboard the Odyssey.

     CARTER

     (smiling in relief)
     Thank you, sir.

     MITCHELL

     (nudging Daniel with his elbow and grinning)
     How 'bout that timing, Jackson?

     DANIEL

     (sighing and grimacing)
     Good timing.

     EMERSON
     Airman, let's get these people out of these bindings and to the
     infirmary.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1, still looking tired and now dressed in black BDUs, sit around
   the briefing table. Daniel holds an ice pack to his cheek. Emerson and
   Marks enter the room and Mitchell and Carter stand. Emerson waves them
   back down.]

     MITCHELL
     Sir.

     EMERSON
     I know you people have been through a lot...

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, we'll live. Hand it over.

   [Marks passes out computer notebooks to SG-1 as Emerson takes a seat at
   the head of the table.]

     EMERSON
     We received this intel from Stargate Command a few hours ago.

     MITCHELL
     Damn. Ba'al's been busy.

     EMERSON
     He's been gathering up Stargates from all over the sector for the
     last several weeks.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, we saw one of them disappear.

     CARTER
     Do we know why?

     EMERSON
     Not yet. Nor do we know where he is.

     TEAL'C
     What of the Lucian Alliance?

     EMERSON
     For the moment, General Landry considers this our top priority.

     CARTER
     Where's he getting his intel?

     EMERSON

     (pausing)
     Nerus.

   [Carter rolls her eyes. Daniel looks up in surprise.]

     MITCHELL

     (shaking his head)
     Oh, Jim Dandy.

     TEAL'C
     Such intelligence cannot be considered reliable.

     DANIEL

     (thinking)
     I'm not sure. Nerus did work for Ba'al for centuries. It's as good a
     place as any to start.

     EMERSON
     And General Landry can be pretty persuasive when he needs to be.

   INT--NERUS'S PRISON CELL, AREA 51

   [Cheeses, breads and other platters are in front of Nerus. Discarded
   bits of food are abandoned across the floor and across the cell bars.]

     LANDRY
     Nerus, you have the most atrocious table manners of any person I
     have ever met.

     NERUS
     Oh, General, please, you forget that despite appearances, I'm not
     human.

     LANDRY

     (exasperated)
     Oh my goodness. Why does Ba'al want a dozen Stargates?

   [Nerus drinks some wine. A buzzer sounds and an airman enters, carrying
   a platter of cupcakes, Twinkies, and other sweets. The guards aim their
   sidearms at Nerus on alert.]

     LANDRY
     Nerus?

     NERUS

     (spotting the platter)
     Dessert! Ha ha!

   [The inner cell door opens and the airman brings in the platter,
   accompanied by the alert guards.]

     NERUS

     (pleased)
     Young man, you have positively read my mind. Come in. Come in. Mm.
     Make room for dessert. Just put...ooh. What are these...individually
     frosted cakes! Ha!

   [The guards cautiously leave the cell and the door slams shut. Landry
   gets up to leave.]

     NERUS
     Well, you're so clever you figured out the perpetrator, what do you
     think?

     LANDRY
     We assume he intends to offer them back to the planets he's stolen
     them from in exchange for some form of payment.

     NERUS

     (shaking his head)
     You're not very intelligent, are you, General?

     LANDRY

     (dryly)
     Sorry to disappoint you.

     NERUS
     Well, you-you're just thinking too small, that's all. You've got to
     think more like a Goa'uld. What is it that Ba'al once had? Think of
     it. Now, think of what he has lost.

     LANDRY

     (realizing)
     He's starting over.

     NERUS
     Precisely. See? There's still hope for you yet. See, some time ago,
     Ba'al came to me looking for a way to rebuild in the event that the
     Jaffa ever succeeded in conquering the Goa'uld. Now I had been
     studying the Stargate system for months, to help you defeat the
     Replicators, incidentally, and I stumbled upon a way to disable the
     correlative update program.

     LANDRY
     So you could move a Stargate and not have it transmit its new
     position to the rest of the network.

     NERUS
     Precisely, so it would seem that Ba'al has put my research into
     practice.

     LANDRY
     Which leads us to where?

     NERUS
     I have a theory, General, but no assortment of cheeses, however
     delicious, could possibly compel me to tell you that.

     LANDRY
     What did you have in mind?

     NERUS
     My freedom.

     LANDRY
     Absolutely not.

   [Landry starts to leave.]

     NERUS
     Once he has set the program, it will be impossible to detect.

     LANDRY
     Your freedom just isn't on the table, Nerus. But I'm sure there is
     something else we can offer.

     NERUS

     (soberly)
     My dear General, I rarely say this, so please, take it to heart when
     I say that for the moment...I'm full.

   EXT--SPACE, NEAR P6G-452

   [A group of ha'taks are in orbit above the planet.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF LEAD LUCIAN ALLIANCE HA'TAK

   [Worrel enters with two guards. He appears very nervous as he stands
   near Netan.]

     NETAN

     (without looking at Worrel)
     What were you thinking Worrel?

     WORREL
     Please don't kill me.

     NETAN

     (angrily)
     Why would I do that?

     WORREL
     The last time I heard you say that to someone, they...

     NETAN
     I'm just stunned that you would honestly believe that SG-1 would
     steal the Gate and trap themselves on the planet.

     WORREL
     Well...I...uh...

     NETAN
     You had them for almost two days, and you learned nothing. And now
     two-thirds of our crop will rot uselessly.

     WORREL
     If we could bring in cargo ships--

     NETAN
     Cargo ships? Do you have any idea how many it would actually take?

     WORREL
     I promise I will avenge this.

     NETAN
     Don't worry about SG-1 and Earth. They are of little consequence. We
     have spies all over the galaxy. Find out who really took the
     Stargate, and get it back...or don't bother returning yourself.

     WORREL
     Yes, Netan.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Nerus, wearing his Greco-Roman robes, enters the Gate room with armed
   escort. Landry stands by the end of the Gate ramp waiting for him. An
   active outgoing wormhole is already formed. Two large black rolling
   cases are placed on the ramp.]

     NERUS

     (startled to see Landry)
     Oh.

     LANDRY
     I trust you're all packed?

     NERUS
     Yes, with a sizeable assortment of what do you call them? Uh...

     LANDRY
     Cupcakes.

     NERUS
     Yes, uh, uh...a most generous point to concede in our negotiation,
     General.

     LANDRY
     Consider it a going away present.

     NERUS
     Well, I'm touched.

   [Nerus moves towards the ramp. Landry steps in front of him, blocking
   his way.]

     LANDRY
     Yes, well, I admit it took some convincing.

     NERUS
     Well, superiors can sometimes be difficult.

     LANDRY
     They do have reason not to trust you.

     NERUS

     (nervously)
     Yes, but-but you did, you did convince them that it was a fair
     bargain--me giving the coordinates for my freedom? Unless, of course
     you don't intend to honor...

   [He looks warily around at the armed guards.]

     LANDRY
     I think you know by now I'm a man of word.

     NERUS
     Oh. Well, yes, of course you are.

     LANDRY

     Then you should have no trouble believing me when I say...
     (leans forward menacingly)
     ...that if you're lying about these coordinates, there will be
     nowhere in this galaxy for you to hide.

     NERUS

     (with a false smile)
     Oh, I believe you.

     LANDRY

     (also with false smile)
     I'm glad.

     NERUS
     Farewell!

   [Nerus grins and drags two large rolling cases up the ramp and through
   the wormhole. Landry watches him depart, and the Gate disengages.]

     LANDRY
     Putz.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry enters the control room.]

     HARRIMAN
     Should I dial the coordinates he left, sir?

     LANDRY
     No, it's probably a black hole or worse. If I've learned one thing
     in this command, it's never to trust a Goa'uld...especially if his
     name is Nerus.

     HARRIMAN

     (smiling)
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   when Harriman knocks on his door.]

     LANDRY

     (turning)
     Come in.

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, we're picking up a subspace signal from the beacon.

     LANDRY
     That was fast.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir. It looks like you were right. He went back to Ba'al.

     LANDRY
     Send the coordinates to Odyssey, ASAP.

     HARRIMAN

     Yes, sir.
     (pausing)
     Sir, if you don't mind me asking...?

     LANDRY
     How did we plant the beacon on Nerus?

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

     LANDRY
     It was a piece of cake.

   [After a pause, Harriman grins in realization and nods.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

   [SG-1 is on the bridge with its standard personnel.]

     MARKS
     Sir, I'm receiving a subspace transmission from SGC. It's a set of
     coordinates.

     DANIEL
     Ba'al.

     TEAL'C
     General Landry is indeed persuasive.

     CARTER
     Colonel, is the Odyssey ready to fight?

     EMERSON
     Our shields have only been tested in simulations, but our weapons
     and navigation are online.

   EXT--SPACE

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RING ROOM, BA'AL'S HATAK

   [Nerus, his mouth covered with frosting, hesitantly steps out of the
   ring room into the corridor, and is startled to see Ba'al waiting for
   him with two Jaffa guards as escorts.]

     NERUS

     (in Goa'uld echo)
     How nice! You came to greet me in person! Oh-oh! I have this
     fabulous innovation I want you to...it's-it's called a cupcake. Oh,
     it's so good!

   [He steps towards Ba'al, but Ba'al stops his advance with an impatient
   wave of his hand..]

     BA'AL

     (in Goa'uld echoing voice)
     Why have you returned?

     NERUS
     My old friend, you-you wound me deeply.

     BA'AL
     I'm capable of wounding you much more deeply. I thought you made
     yourself quite comfortable with the Tau'ri...or was it the Ori?

   [Ba'al snaps his fingers, and the Jaffa on either side of him aim their
   weapons at Nerus.]

     NERUS

     (cackling)
     You-you actually believe that-that I would defect to the Ori? No,
     no, no. It was a temporary lapse of judgment, I admit, but, uh, I
     have never, uh, in my life, ever wavered one iota in my
     devotion...sire.

   [Ba'al waves off his Jaffa.]

     BA'AL
     Are you certain you were not followed?

     NERUS

     (with false modesty)
     I am a genius, you know.

     BA'AL

     (dryly)
     So you insist.

     NERUS
     Yes, and so I have proven in my service to you time and time again.
     Do you know how many Stargates I had to go through to get here? Ha,
     ha. Five Stargates...

   [Ba'al smirks and turns away from Nerus walking down the hallway. Nerus
   follows, continuing to speak. The Jaffa surround and escort them. One
   Jaffa carries the two cases.]

     NERUS

     (continuing)
     ...and that kind and naive General promised me...anyway, he gave me
     his word that he wouldn't follow me.

     BA'AL
     If you wish to return to my court, Nerus, you shall have to prove
     yourself.

     NERUS
     How?

     BA'AL
     Find me planets suitable for my new empire. I'm ready to begin anew.

     NERUS
     Well, first I must recover from my...harrowing...ordeal.

   [His voice falters as he observes three Ba'al clones passing by him.
   Nerus looks very concerned.]

     BA'AL

     (smirking)
     It would be wise not to defy me, Nerus. Things have changed
     considerably since you left.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, ODYSSEY

   [SG-1, Marks, and Emerson watch as Carter gives a presentation. On the
   video screen in front of her is a schematic of a ha'tak.]

     CARTER
     From what little we know of Ba'al's ship, there's only one cargo
     hold big enough to store the Stargates, and that's here.

   [She indicates the spot on the schematic.]

     MITCHELL
     We beam onto the ship, make our way to the cargo hold, and tag the
     Gates with these suckers.

   [Mitchell holds up a locator beacon, which Daniel takes and studies.]

     DANIEL
     Locator beacons.

     CARTER
     They only operate through subspace, so they shouldn't be detected.
     Once we lock onto their signal, we beam back the Gates, beam
     ourselves out, and hopefully be gone before Ba'al knows the
     difference.

     MARKS
     But won't Ba'al be able to detect the Odyssey, and even if they
     don't, how do you beam through his shields?

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Well, let's just say that's been taken into consideration.

   INT--LAB, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Nerus unpacks one of his cases. He studies a small dome object, then
   takes a crystal out of its back. He moves to a control panel, and
   inserts the crystal, bringing up a display screen. A lot of data
   appears on the screen. After a few seconds, gaps start appearing in the
   data, then the screen begins to falter. Lights begin to flicker. Nerus
   looks around in alarm.]

     NERUS
     Oh, dear.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, ODYSSEY

     CARTER
     General Landry had Doctor Lee program a virus into several of
     Nerus's devices. As soon as he interfaces one of them with the ship,
     it should kill all their systems: shields, sensors, weapons...

     now, sir.

     EMERSON

     (keying comm)
     Understood. We're on our way.

   [They all leave the briefing room.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

   [SG-1, Emerson, and Marks enter the bridge, the latter two taking their
   usual stations.]

     MARKS
     Ba'al's ship should be dead ahead, sir.

     EMERSON
     Have they detected us?

     MARKS
     Negative, sir. But I am receiving a subspace locator code.

     CARTER
     It was programmed to transmit when the virus went active.

     MITCHELL

     (muttering)
     Nerus didn't waste time for a change.

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Lights flicker and the ha'tak starts making rumbling noises. The ship
   goes dark.]

     BA'AL
     What is happening?

     VI'TAK
     All our systems have failed.

     BA'AL
     How can that be?

   [Vi'tak brings up a display of a schematic of the ship. A sensor blinks
   of an area on board the ship.]

     VI'TAK
     I have limited power back online. Looks like the systems are being
     disrupted from within the ship.

   [Ba'al stands from his throne and starts to exit.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Ba'al waits for the doors to creak open. They can only partially do
   so. He grimaces, and steps over the knee-high, still sealed portion.]

     BA'AL

     (impatiently)
     Come with me.

   [Two Jaffa carrying staff weapons also squeeze through the partially
   opened door and follow Ba'al.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [A patrol of Jaffa heads down the hall. Just after they move out of
   sight, SG-1 is beamed into the corridor. Mitchell holds a Hekler & Koch
   G36K, the others carry Hekler & Koch MP7A1s (Teal'c holding one in each
   hand). All of them are poised to fire at any threat.]

     TEAL'C

     (getting his bearings)
     This way.

   [He leads them down a corridor.]

     MITCHELL

     (whispering into radio)
     We're in.

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (into comm link)
     Understood. We'll hold the station within beaming range.

   INT--LAB, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Nerus, his mouth still coated with spots of frosting, continues to
   work at his terminal as Ba'al and his Jaffa escort enter. He turns
   distractedly and notices Ba'al.]

     NERUS

     Oh. Hello. Oh, it's just a teeny, tiny virus. I'm sure I can
     eradicate it in short order...as soon as I regain control of the
     terminal.
     (muttering to himself)
     Oh, General. You are more devious than I thought you were. You
     disappoint me.
     (To Ba'al, nervously)
     I'll-I'll keep you informed. Thank you.

   [Nerus turns back to the terminal. Ba'al reaches out and takes one of
   the Jaffa's staff weapons, casually aiming it towards Nerus. After a
   few moments, Nerus turns back around.]

     NERUS
     Oh. Here you are again. Oh, well, I-I don't think that-that shooting
     the console can help, but you can try.

   [Nerus moves out of the way of the terminal. Ba'al primes the staff
   weapon and tracks Nerus's movements. Nerus frowns dejectedly.]

     NERUS
     Oh, I see. I don't suppose there's anything I can say?

     BA'AL

     (considers, then shakes his head)
     Mm-mm.

     NERUS

     (pleading)
     But I'm so interesting.

   INT--CORRIDOR NEAR CARGO BAY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Teal'c watches while guards move out of range. He then gives a signal.
   SG-1 moves down the corridor in a relay type manner. Daniel takes
   point, providing cover as the other three move ahead of him. Sam does
   the same, and so on as they advance. When they reach the door to the
   cargo bay, Daniel guards from one side of the door while Sam moves to
   the terminal and starts to press the controls. Mitchell crouches near
   her providing cover for the other direction. Teal'c guards from the
   opposite side of the corridor.]

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Vi'tak detects Carter's attempts to open the door on his display of
   the ship.]

     VI'TAK

     (into comm)
     We have an intruder on the ship.

   INT--CARGO BAY AND IMMEDIATE VICINITY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Carter, Daniel and Mitchell enter the room, dropping their weapons and
   staring in shock. Teal'c guards from the door. The room is filled with
   Stargates and DHDs.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, boy. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
     eleven, twelve...

     CARTER
     We're going to need more locators.

   [Teal'c observes a patrol of Jaffa organizing themselves at the end of
   the corridor.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell.

   [Mitchell looks back to see Teal'c readying his weapon.]

     MITCHELL

     (whispering to Daniel and Carter)
     Company. Ideas?

   [Teal'c steps into the open and begins firing with both weapons,
   downing several Jaffa before they can fire. He depletes his clips and
   takes cover in an alcove. Mitchell follows up, firing his own weapon.]

   [Daniel and Carter hear the weapons' fire and race to place locator
   beacons on the Stargates.]

   [Mitchell depletes his clip than crouches back for cover against the
   doorway alcove.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Houston, we have a problem.

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (into radio)
     What is it?

   [They hear weapons fire through the comm link.]

     MARKS
     Sir, another three mother ships just dropped out of hyperspace.

     EMERSON
     What?

     MARKS
     Intercepting a hail, sir.

     NETAN

     (over comm link, audio only)
     Ha'tak vessel. This is Netan of the Lucian Alliance. Surrender now,
     or you will be destroyed.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Three ha'taks close in on Ba'al's ship and the Odyssey.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (over comm)
     Lucian Alliance, this is Colonel Emerson, commander of the Earth
     vessel Odyssey, please respond.

     MARKS
     Sir, they've powered up weapons. Target appears to be Ba'al's ship.

     EMERSON

     (into different channel)
     SG-1, this is Odyssey, what's your status?

   INT--CARGO BAY AND VICINITY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Mitchell and Teal'c exchange fire with the Jaffa in the corridor.
   Carter places a locator beacon on a Stargate. An Asgard beam deposits a
   satchel of locator beacons on the floor. Daniel sweeps it up and tosses
   it to Carter.]

   [Mitchell takes cover in the doorway to the alcove again.]

     MITCHELL
     Jackson, a little help!

   [Daniel runs out of the cargo bay and into the corridor, firing his
   weapon several times before taking cover from staff weapon blasts.]

     MITCHELL

     (into comm link)
     Our position has been compromised, but we are attempting to proceed
     with the mission.

   [Mitchell changes clips in his weapon.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (into comm link)
     Be advised, the Lucian Alliance just showed up.

   INT--CARGO BAY AND VICINITY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

     CARTER
     You can't go up against all of them with an untested ship.

     EMERSON

     (over comm)
     They're targeting Ba'al's ship. We gotta get you out of there, now!

     CARTER
     That's a negative, I'm still tagging the Gates.

   [She continues to place beacons on the Gates rapidly.]

     EMERSON

     (over comm)
     Colonel, without shields, Ba'al's ship won't be able to withstand
     anything.

     MITCHELL
     We know. Thank you. SG-1 out!

   [Mitchell continues to exchange fire with the Jaffa.]

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [Ba'al and his guards return to the bridge.]

     BA'AL
     Status?

   [Vi'tak and other Jaffa rise from where they were checking equipment
   under the control panel.]

     VI'TAK
     Managed to restore sensors and communications. I am detecting four
     other ships in close proximity.

     BA'AL
     What?

     VI'TAK
     We're being hailed.

     BA'AL

     (retuning to his throne)
     Put them onscreen.

   [Netan appears on the viewscreen.]

     NETAN

     (over comm link)
     This is Netan of the Lucian Alliance. You have cargo that belongs to
     us. You will surrender it and your ship now.

     BA'AL
     You are in no position to make such demands.

   INT--BRIDGE, LEAD LUCIAN ALLIANCE HA'TAK

     NETAN
     You have no shields and no weapons. Surrender immediately, or
     prepare to be boarded.

     BA'AL

     (over video link)
     Go ahead and try.

   [The link disconnects.]

     NETAN
     Fire on them. Target weapons and hyperdrive engines.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Lucian Alliance ha'taks fire on Ba'al's ship, hitting it in
   several places.]

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

     BA'AL
     Get me my shields!

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Sir, the Lucian Alliance vessel has opened fire.

     EMERSON
     SG-1, stand by for extraction.

   INT--CARGO BAY AND VICINITY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

     CARTER
     Attaching the last beacon now. Go!

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Activating transport.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Ba'al's ha'tak continues to take damage.]

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [A few sparks flare on the pel'tak, causing everyone to wince.]

     VI'TAK
     I have managed to restore shields.

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Sir, we've got a problem.

     EMERSON

     (into comm link)
     Ba'al's shields just went back up. You're gonna have to sit tight.

   INT--CARGO BAY AND VICINITY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     We can't "sit" for long.
     (to Daniel and Teal'c)
     Fall back.

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Mitchell fire their weapons and retreat into the
   cargo bay.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     EMERSON

     (to crewman at port command console)
     Bring us about.
     (to Marks)
     Captain, fire forward rail guns at the lead ship. It looks like
     we're going to be testing our shields.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Lucian Alliance vessels continue to fire at Ba'al's ship, which is
   now shielded. The Odyssey turns and fires its rail guns at the Lucian
   Alliance ha'taks.]

   INT--BRIDGE ODYSSEY

   [Sparks begin to fly and the ship is jolted slightly.]

     EMERSON

     (ordering the port station)
     Evasive.
     (to Marks at starboard station)
     Report.

     MARKS
     Shields are holding, but down 11%, sir. The Lucian Alliance ship
     shows minimal damage.

     EMERSON
     What about Ba'al's ship? Can we get 'em out of there yet?

     MARKS
     Negative, sir.

   INT--CARGO BAY, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

   [SG-1 are crouched behind some storage bins. Mitchell slams a clip into
   his G36K.]

     MITCHELL
     Last mag. All right, we need to find another way off this boat.

   [Carter stares at the DHD and smiles.]

     MITCHELL

     (noticing her expression)
     Carter?

     CARTER
     I have an idea.

     MITCHELL
     Nice.

     TEAL'C

     (in warning)
     Jaffa.

     MITCHELL

     (ordering)
     Covering fire.

   [They all stand and fire their weapons at the advancing Jaffa.]

   INT--BRIDGE, BA'AL'S HA'TAK

     BA'AL
     Forget weapons. Bring our hyperdrive online.

     VI'TAK
     My lord, I'm showing imminent shield failure.

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Sir, Ba'al's ship just lost shields.

     EMERSON

     Get 'em out of there, now!
     (into intercom)
     Hangar deck, report.

     HANGER DECK AIRMAN

     (over radio)
     Sir, we've got all the Gates but one. We couldn't get a lock on its
     beacon.

     EMERSON
     What about SG-1?

     HANGER DECK AIRMAN

     (over radio)
     Negative, sir.

   [Emerson looks grave.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Ba'al's ha'tak continues to get bombarded with weapons' fire. Its
   shields have failed and explosions cascade around the ship before it
   explodes.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Ba'al's ship has been destroyed.

   INT-BRIDGE, LEAD LUCIAN ALLIANCE, HA'TAK

     NETAN
     Concentrate all weapons' fire on the Earth vessel.

   INT--BRIDGE, ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     All three Lucian Alliance vessels are targeting us now, sir.

     EMERSON

     (regretfully)
     Engage hyperdrive.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey moves away from the ha'taks and enters hyperspace.]

   INT--BRIDGE, LEAD LUCIAN ALLIANCE HA'TAK

   [Netan sits back in the throne of the pel'tak and sighs.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A wormhole disengages as SG-1 saunters down the ramp. Landry and a
   host of guards await them at the base of the ramp.]

     LANDRY
     Glad to see you. I'm a little surprised to see come through the
     Gate.

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter successfully reprogrammed one of the DHDs in Ba'al's
     cargo hold, so that we could, in fact, escape.

     LANDRY
     Well done.

     CARTER
     With your permission, sir, we should let the Odyssey know that we're
     okay. They probably fear the worst.

     LANDRY
     The worst?

     DANIEL
     Uh, that we were blown up on Ba'al's ship when the Lucian Alliance
     attacked, sir.

     LANDRY
     So the Stargates were destroyed?

     CARTER
     No, hopefully the Odyssey managed to beam the Gates off in time.

     LANDRY
     An eventful few days. Debrief in one hour.

   [Landry leaves. Daniel nurses his injured cheek. Mitchell shifts,
   beginning to grin.]

     MITCHELL
     We have got the best jobs in the world, don't we?

     CARTER

     (grimacing)
     I'm going to hit the shower.

   [She heads out of one door.]

     DANIEL

     (pointedly ignoring Mitchell)
     I'm going to find a doctor.

   [He heads out the other door.]

     TEAL'C
     We are indeed suitably employed.

   [Teal'c smiles subtly before leaving. Mitchell adjusts his grip on his
   weapon and continues grinning.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, it was a good day.

   FADE OUT
