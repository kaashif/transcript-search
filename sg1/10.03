   TEASER

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey exits hyperspace and slowly approaches a planet with a
   single moon.]

   INT--DINING ROOM OF ODYSSEY

   [Mitchell and Vala are eating from food trays. Across from them, Daniel
   is asleep, his head on his hands. They are all wearing black BDU's.]

     VALA
     Funny, he doesn't look excited.

     MITCHELL
     Trust me. Like a kid who was up all night on Christmas Eve.

     VALA
     I thought we imposed a moratorium on cultural references I wouldn't
     understand.

     MITCHELL
     So excited, he was up all night.

     VALA
     It's only because he was worried sick about the success of the
     mission.

   [As Vala speaks, Mitchell reaches across the table and tickles Daniel's
   ear with a twisted-up straw wrapper. Daniel flinches a little. Mitchell
   continues poking him.]

     MITCHELL
     Wake up, sunshine. Time to see what old Santa brought.

   [Daniel suddenly slaps his ear and groans a little.]

     MITCHELL
     Morning.

   [Daniel lifts his head and squints at them.]

     DANIEL

     (blearily)
     What?

     MITCHELL
     We just came out of hyperspace. I'm guessing you don't want to miss
     the landing.

     DANIEL

     (looking at his watch)
     Wha? What time is it?

     EMERSON

     (over intercom)
     This is the Captain. All hands take stations for atmospheric entry.

   [Vala puts a piece of pastry in her mouth as Mitchell smiles at
   Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (mystified)
     Why didn't you tell me?

   [He gets up and rushes out, leaving his tray of food untouched. Vala
   and Mitchell watch him leave. Vala chews and spits a seed out into her
   hand and drops it onto the tray.]

     VALA
     Okay, he's a little excited.

   [Mitchell and Vala get up to follow.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Emerson is seated in his command chair, surrounded by bridge
   personnel.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (over radio)
     Odyssey, this is flight. You are clear for landing.

     EMERSON

     (into radio)
     Understood, flight. We have the beacon.

   [Daniel comes jogging onto the bridge, Vala and Mitchell trailing.
   Carter is standing in front of the command area, looking out the
   viewscreen.]

     CARTER
     Hey, you're just in time.

     DANIEL
     Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for the world. You know the
     number of times I tried to get here?

     VALA
     Only two of those times were my fault.

   [Daniel does a double-take at her, then they all gaze out the window.]

   EXT--SKY ABOVE ATLANTIS

   [Odyssey flies through the atmosphere toward Atlantis.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [The four watch the city approach on the screen.]

     DANIEL

     (wistful)
     It is beautiful.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Odyssey, this is Weir. I wanted to be the first to say "welcome to
     Atlantis."

     EMERSON

     (smiling, into radio)
     Thank you, Doctor. We're getting a good look at your fair city even
     as we approach.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Feel free to take a moment. But Stargate Command wants you to get
     started on your mission as soon as you've offloaded our supplies.
     Weir out.

   [As she speaks, Daniel's expression becomes a bit troubled, and he
   drops his head for a moment.]

     CARTER
     What's wrong?

     DANIEL
     Ah, nothing, I guess I just wish my first trip to Atlantis wasn't
     under such desperate circumstances.

     MITCHELL
     Ah, it's just another mission, Jackson.

     VALA
     One upon which the fate of the entire galaxy hangs in the balance.

     MITCHELL
     And he goes on those all the time.

     CARTER
     Vala's not wrong. If we don't succeed, and the Ori manage to get
     more ships through that Supergate...

     MITCHELL
     Well, like the lady said, let's all just take a moment.

   [They watch as the ship gets very close to the city, preparing to
   land.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, moment's over. Let's go save the galaxy.

   [Mitchell leads Vala and Carter out. Daniel stays behind, pleased.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The city sits under light clouds near sunset.]

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [A large screen shows a schematic of the Supergate. Carter, Mitchell,
   Vala, and Daniel are there with Weir, McKay, and Sheppard. The two
   groups are interspersed.]

     CARTER
     The Ori Supergate has been inactive since they sent their first
     wave. But it's been reported that the Priors are promising
     reinforcements for their armies, which are on their way and should
     be here soon. Now we can only assume that means more ships, and
     these four are already more than we can handle. We have to act now.

     MCKAY
     Well, why don't you try dialing out? I mean, if it's powered by a
     black hole, you should be able to keep the thing up and running
     almost indefinitely.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm sure they thought of that before they came all this way, Rodney.

     CARTER
     It was what we were attempting to do when the Ori fleet first came
     through. Now the Asgard have since tried again, but for some reason,
     they can't dial out.

   [Sheppard smiles as she confirms he was right.]

     WEIR
     But you might be able to dial in?

     CARTER
     Well, that's the problem. It was designed to dial in from another
     galaxy.

     SHEPPARD
     Like one of the Stargates in the Pegasus?

     MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, no. The diameter of a Stargate is not arbitrary.
     There is a specific correlation between the energy required to
     create a stable wormhole--

     CARTER

     (irritated)
     And the size of the gate. I know that!

     MCKAY

     (agitated)
     And, it's exponentially proportional to size, which means the energy
     required to create a connection with a Supergate would far exceed
     that of an ordinary gate. It'd be like putting together a Saint
     Bernard and a Chihuahua.

     VALA
     And the problem with that would be...

     MCKAY
     Well, obviously it's a question of uh...

   [Daniel looks at Vala and sighs heavily.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, I see. You're, um, mocking me, aren't you.

     VALA
     What? Um, no, I'm not from Earth. I honestly didn't get the
     reference.

   [Sheppard smiles at her.]

     MCKAY

     (gesturing with his hands)
     Oh, well, they're both dogs...

     CARTER
     McKay!

     WEIR
     Colonel Carter, please continue.

     SHEPPARD
     If he speaks again, I'll shoot him.

     DANIEL
     But to answer your question, we are introducing another Stargate
     into the equation. Teal'c should have it in position right now.

     CARTER
     If we can make a connection between that gate and one from the
     Pegasus galaxy--

     MCKAY
     You, you're trying to make a jump. Don't shoot me; you know I can't
     help myself.

   [Sheppard shakes his head but goes on.]

     SHEPPARD
     A jump. Can you do that?

   [Carter nods and starts to speak.]

     MITCHELL

     (interrupting)
     One of Colonel Carter's more brilliant planet-saving ideas from a
     few years back. Stargate Command inadvertently dialed the gate
     address of a planet that was on a collision course with a black
     hole. P3W-451, if memory serves.

     CARTER
     The only way to disconnect before Cheyenne Mountain got swallowed up
     was to set off a shape charge right at the event horizon.

   [She animates the schematic on the flat screen to illustrate the points
   she is making. An ordinary Stargate in the Pegasus would connect to a
   Supergate via another ordinary Stargate near the Supergate.]

     CARTER
     Now that energy spike forced our outgoing wormhole to jump to
     another Stargate that was relatively close by.

     MITCHELL
     And, if we can do it again we can tie up the Ori Supergate
     indefinitely.

     MCKAY
     Even if you were able to establish an initial connection--

     MITCHELL
     We need a nuke, we know.

     MCKAY
     And a dialing crystal capable of--

     MITCHELL
     Already have one.

     MCKAY
     And if you want to keep the connection open for more than
     thirty-eight minutes--

     MITCHELL
     Yack. Yack yack yack!

     MCKAY

     (over Mitchell)
     You need to find a black hole in the Pegasus galaxy!

   [Carter smiles watching Mitchell match McKay point for point.]

     MITCHELL
     This is not our first barbecue, Doctor McKay!

     MCKAY

     I am just saying, the yield calculations can be extremely tricky, if
     not borderline impossible.
     (smugly)
     You may need me.

     VALA

     (laughing)
     Colonel Carter said as much.

     CARTER
     Oooh, we weren't going to tell him that.

   [McKay looks slightly pleased with himself.]

     WEIR
     John, do you think you could spare Rodney from your team?

     SHEPPARD
     Hell, you can keep him.

   [Carter smiles, amused.]

     MITCHELL

     (smiling)
     Nice.

   INT--BALCONY OVERLOOKING GATE ROOM, ATLANTIS

   [Mitchell and Sheppard enter from a side door and move toward the
   balcony.]

     MITCHELL
     I gotta tell you, Sheppard... it's a nice place you got here.

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks. We just painted.

   [They turn and begin walking along the railing.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, good luck, and listen, if McKay gives you a hard time, just...

   [He points with his fingers, and Mitchell copies him.]

     MITCHELL
     Shoot him.

     SHEPPARD
     Also, he's mortally allergic to citrus.

     MITCHELL
     Really?

     SHEPPARD
     I keep one with me at all times.

   [He pulls a lemon from his pocket.]

     SHEPPARD
     It's just a comfort to know...

   [He tosses it to Mitchell.]

     SHEPPARD
     ...it's there.

     MITCHELL
     That's good intel. Thanks.

   [Sheppard smiles, pats Mitchell on the shoulder, and walks away. McKay
   walks up from behind where Sheppard had been, having seen the
   exchange.]

     MCKAY

     (laughing nervously and gesturing toward where Sheppard headed)
     That's uh, that's uh, that's a good one. We're actually uh... we're
     quite close.

     MITCHELL
     You packed your bags?

     MCKAY
     Hmm? Oh, right, right.

   [McKay heads off as Carter, who has been approaching smiles and
   follows. Daniel and Weir stop in front of Mitchell.]

     MITCHELL
     All right, be good.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, good luck, I wish I was going with you.

     MITCHELL
     No you don't.

     DANIEL
     No I don't.

     MITCHELL
     Ah, this place is Daniel Disneyland. Wow. Just... find the weapon.

     DANIEL
     No pressure.

   [Mitchell nods and leaves.]

     WEIR
     Yes, your desire to access the Atlantis database has seemed quite
     urgent, Doctor Jackson. Shall we?

     DANIEL

     (looking around)
     Ah, where's Vala?

   [They look around, and Weir sees Vala leaning over a balcony outside.]

     WEIR
     Oh, this way.

   [They move toward a door, Daniel looking worried.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   EXT--BALCONY OVERLOOKING OCEAN ON ATLANTIS, DAY

   [Vala is bending over the balcony looking at the city structure below.
   Daniel and Weir join her, and she steps away to face them.]

     VALA

     Well, Daniel, no wonder you've been obsessing about coming here.
     This place, it must be full of so many wonderful...
     (whispering to him)
     souvenirs.

     DANIEL
     Uh, how much of the city have you been able to explore?

     WEIR
     Just over half now. But we have the city schematics, so we have a
     fairly good idea of what's where. Still, there are entire sections
     of the city and whole systems we don't even pretend to understand.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you could spend a lifetime trying.

     WEIR
     I hope to.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The three enter and walk down to the gate.]

     WEIR
     I ran that search you asked for. I asked for every pronunciation of
     Castiana and Sahal I could come up with.

     DANIEL
     And, nothing.

     WEIR
     You didn't actually expect either of those names to be in there, did
     you?

     DANIEL
     No.

     VALA
     Did you get the spelling right?

   [Daniel rolls his eyes. They arrive at the bottom of the stairs. Vala
   starts to go one way, but Daniel grabs her arm and drags her back to
   stay with them.]

     WEIR
     Well, that's the problem with Ancient languages. I mean, the
     pronunciation can change within a handful of generations, let alone
     thousands of years. The etymology of an individual word can be lost
     entirely.

     DANIEL
     Still we know there's something within the Atlantis library.

   [Vala touches Daniel's arm, stopping him from following Weir.]

     VALA
     Hey. Do we have to go in there straight away? Can we do some
     sightseeing first?

     DANIEL

     (tilting his head in admonishment)
     Um, maybe later.

   [He turns her toward Weir's path.]

   INT--WEAPONS LAB ON THE ODYSSEY

   [There are several nuclear warheads on the deck, in containers. Carter
   works on a control console for one warhead with McKay nearby.]

     EMERSON

     (over intercom)
     This is the Captain. Stand by for lift-off.

     CARTER
     You can check my preliminary yield calculations. They're on that
     station over there.

     MCKAY
     I'm sure they're fine.

     CARTER
     It's the reason you're here, McKay.

     MCKAY
     Mmm, right. But um, first, I just wanted to thank you for being
     there for me recently in a time of great personal need. Well,
     actually, you weren't there-- I was alone in the dark, but um, you
     know, it sure seemed like you were.

     CARTER

     (cringing)
     Are you telling me one of your fantasies?

     MCKAY
     No, no! It was a hallucination. Look, I had a concussion, I was
     trapped in the back of a sinking jumper, and my mind conjured you up
     as a means of survival. What you would do in my situation. Saved my
     life.

     CARTER
     Okay, well that's... sort of nice.

     MCKAY

     (smiling)
     Hmm. Yes it was.

     CARTER

     (realizing)
     Was I naked?

     MCKAY
     Partially.

     CARTER

     (closing her eyes and pointing)
     Check my calculations, McKay.

     MCKAY
     Hmm. Well.

   [He walks away slowly, looking over the warheads. Carter closes her
   eyes for a moment then resumes working.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

   [Weir, Daniel, and Vala enter a large room lit with green-lighted
   panels, with a raised platform in the middle and a control console on a
   podium-like pedestal on one edge of it.]

     WEIR
     We use this room sparingly, now. It's a bit of a power hog, and we
     can access the database from workstations throughout the city when
     we need to. But for the first-time user, this is the place.

   [Weir steps onto the platform and touches the pedestal. Immediately the
   images of a woman appears in the center. Dressed in white but with
   black hair, she appears to be glowing.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Hello.

     WEIR
     It's as simple as asking questions to the holographic interface. For
     example--

     TECHNICIAN

     (over intercom)
     Doctor Weir to Stargate operations.

     WEIR

     Ah, I'm sorry.
     (into intercom)
     I'll be right there.

   [She steps off the platform and heads toward the door.]

     WEIR
     The interface can walk you through your search until I get back. Oh,
     I should probably warn you, she seemed a little bit patronizing. The
     program was designed to teach very young children the Lantian
     systems.

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

   [As soon as she leaves, Daniel and Vala race to get to the pedestal.
   Daniel gets there first.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Hello.

     VALA
     Hello, we're looking for a couple of planets in the Milky Way.

     DANIEL
     Vala.

     VALA
     What? What can it hurt to ask?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     You may enter your query verbally, or by entering it manually on the
     console before you.

     DANIEL
     I'll speak... if that's all right.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Of course. But note for future sessions, manual input is required
     for most system interaction.

     DANIEL
     I think I had her in Grade Five.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey moves through space at sub-light speeds, toward a black
   hole surrounded by an accretion disk.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Emerson is in the command chair. McKay and Mitchell are standing
   nearby. Carter stands behind Lt. Womack.]

     EMERSON

     (to Womack)
     Maintain orbit at minimum safe distance. We'll keep sub-light
     engines on standby.

   [McKay steps up to join Mitchell at the front viewscreen.]

     MITCHELL
     Is that thing cool, or what?

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

     MITCHELL
     The black hole.

     MCKAY
     What you're looking at is called the accretion disk. It's matter
     trapped in the gravity well. You can't see the black hole itself.

   [Mitchell stares him down.]

     MITCHELL
     Which is cool.

   [He gives a stern look and walks away. McKay looks a bit scared.]

     CARTER
     We're in optimal range for releasing the gate. We can commit to the
     next phase.

     EMERSON

     (into intercom)
     This is Emerson to flight operations. Release the gate.

   INT--CARGO BAY OF ODYSSEY

   [A gate is held in place by two brackets. The outer door opens, and the
   brackets release and move out of the way. The gate starts to float
   toward the black hole in the distance. Small stabilizing thrusters fire
   to rotate the gate and move it toward the accretion disk.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Standing beside Mitchell, Carter smiles.]

     MCKAY
     Well, it's going to be a few minutes before the gate's in position
     and ready to dial out, and uh, I missed lunch. So, I'm going to fix
     myself a sandwich. Anyone want anything? Anyone?

   [Emerson, Mitchell, Carter, and Womack give him an unwelcoming look.]

     MCKAY
     No? No. All right, fine.

   [He leaves. Mitchell gives Carter a look, and she smiles at him as if
   in embarrassment.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

   [An image of the Milky Way galaxy spins slowly below the ceiling.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, that's Earth, and that is Taonas.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Praclarush Taonas was one of the earliest Lantian cities. It was
     abandoned when the inhabitants learned their sun was nearing the end
     of its life.

   [Daniel dips his head in impatience as Vala makes talking gestures with
   her hand.]

     DANIEL
     Yes, thank you, I know. I've been there. Okay, um, show me the order
     in which the earliest Ancient cities were founded.

     VALA
     How is that useful? You going to join up all the dots and draw a
     pretty picture?

     DANIEL
     I'm just getting my bearings. You're going to have to get used to
     the fact this is probably going to take a while.

     VALA

     (falsely happy)
     The way you approach things, it could take the rest of our lives!

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry, but we're not going to find the location of this thing by
     looking under "W" for "Weapon"!

     VALA
     "P" for "Planet," then? I'm just saying, ask the question!

     DANIEL
     Ahh. Doctor Weir already tried it, it'd be a complete waste of time.

     VALA
     It would take all of eleven seconds!

   [Daniel grips the podium in frustration and sighs.]

     DANIEL

     Hello. We're looking for the names of two planets, known on Earth in
     ancient times in the dialect of Old English as Castiana and Sahal.
     (to Vala)
     Satisfied?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Taoth Vaclarush, and Valos Cor.

   [Daniel looks up in amazement. Vala walks toward him and the hologram.]

     VALA
     Now, I am satisfied.

   [Above them, the two planets are highlighted on the galaxy map, notated
   with Ancient symbols -- gate addresses.]

     VALA

     (sighing)
     See, Daniel? It doesn't hurt to ask.

   [Daniel looks in consternation at the hologram, surprised and
   thoughtful.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Odyssey hovers outside and slightly above the disk.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Carter and Mitchell study the monitor showing what is happening with
   the disk.]

     CARTER
     Gate telemetry checks out. Stabilizing thrusters are on line, and
     power is well into the green. We're good to go.

     MITCHELL
     Where's McKay?

     MCKAY

     (annoyed)
     I'm here. One of your crew wouldn't let me finish my sandwich in the
     corridor.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, the nerve of that crewman, huh? We're about to try a connection.

     MCKAY
     Go ahead, that's the easy part.

     CARTER
     Thank you. I've already set the remote dial command. It's just going
     to take a while because of time dilation.

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

   [The display shows the local Stargate has become active.]

     CARTER
     Wormhole is established.

     MCKAY
     Of course it is.

   [Carter nods at Mitchell, who activates the radio.]

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c, I have a collect call from the Pegasus Galaxy, will you
     accept the charges?

     TEAL'C

     (over radio, after a moment)
     I will indeed, Colonel Mitchell.

   [Teal'c's voice sounds lower and slowed down compared to normal.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, how are things back home in the Milky Way?

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ORI SUPERGATE

   [Teal'c sits near the Supergate in a Goa'uld Al'kesh. The gate sizzles
   with energy.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

     TEAL'C
     The secondary gate is in position. There has been no sign of Ori
     activity since my arrival at the Supergate, which was in fact
     several hours ago.

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     Well, we're about to get the party started, so just hang loose.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     TEAL'C

     (over radio, after a delay)
     I am hanging loosely, Colonel Mitchell.

     MITCHELL
     Is it just me, or does his voice sound deeper?

     MCKAY
     It's the time dilation effect of the black hole. It can't be helped.

     MITCHELL
     RIght. So, who wants to set off a big ol' firecracker?

     MCKAY
     A twenty-six megaton directed energy firecracker, you mean. Not
     until we decrease the yield by five percent.

     CARTER
     I knew you were going to say that.

     MCKAY
     Oh, forgive me for not wanting to vaporize the Stargate on our first
     attempt.

     CARTER

     (walking away)
     We're on a clock, McKay. We have to take the risk.

     MCKAY
     You know, I find your recklessness so se--

   and Mitchell steps out of the way. McKay joins Carter at a control
   station.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c, it's Sam. We're about to launch the first warhead to the
     pre-programmed coordinates. Are you at a safe distance from both
     gates?

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     I am.

     EMERSON

     Attention all hands. Stand by, launching first warhead.

     MITCHELL

     Teal'c, what's the good news?

     MCKAY
     Delay is annoying.

     MITCHELL
     Black hole. Time dilation. Can't be helped.

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     The news is not good, Colonel Mitchell. The first attempt was
     unsuccessful.

     CARTER
     Okay, let's try again.

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

     VALA

     (quiet but insistent)
     Daniel!

     DANIEL
     Hmm.

     VALA
     We got what we came for.

     DANIEL
     I know.

     VALA
     Shouldn't we be out there telling someone?

     DANIEL
     Not yet.

     VALA
     Okay, well, she told us the name of the planets. They were right up
     there glowing in the ceiling. Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor. She
     even gave us the addresses, which means we could be out there
     somewhere overlooking Atlantis, toasting with exotic beverages!

     DANIEL
     There's something else going on.

     VALA
     What?

     DANIEL
     Well, it shouldn't have worked. I mean I didn't expect it to when I
     asked Elizabeth to try. But I thought there'd at least be some
     remnant. Some vague similarity between the words Castiana and Sahal
     and their Ancient language counterparts.

     VALA
     She wouldn't lie.

     DANIEL
     I don't know. But explain this to me: how can this database
     translate in real time a language spoken eight thousand years after
     the Ancients abandoned Atlantis?

     VALA
     That's a tough one.

   [Daniel nods.]

     DANIEL

     (to hologram)
     Is there an archival visual record of the Lantian citizens who fled
     to Earth?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     There is.

     DANIEL
     Display them for me. One at a time.

   [Vala closes her eyes and drops her head in frustration.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OF ODYSSEY

   [McKay, Carter, and Mitchell are walking.]

     MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, no, no. Those yield calculations are perfectly fine.

     CARTER
     They are.

     MCKAY
     If your goal is to blow up the Stargate.

     CARTER
     Anything less and it won't add enough energy to the matter stream to
     make a jump to the Stargate.

     MCKAY
     And anything more, and the Stargate will be destroyed. Look, you
     want to run high voltage, but you've only got an extension cord.
     It's impossible, and I told you so before we left Atlantis!

     MITCHELL
     No, you said it was borderline impossible!

     MCKAY
     Yes, well we've crossed the border! But hey, you know, don't let me
     stop you, don't calibrate your warhead, beam your bomb.

     MITCHELL
     You know, Sam, this is not the Rodney McKay I heard stories about.

     CARTER
     I know.

     MCKAY
     What stories? What have you heard?

     MITCHELL
     Well, for starters, that you didn't know the meaning of the word
     "impossible."

     MCKAY
     Well, I certainly know the meaning.

     MITCHELL
     And that under threat of impending death, you could work absolute
     miracles.

     MCKAY
     I suppose Sheppard told you that?

     MITCHELL
     Yes, he did.

     MCKAY
     Yes, well it's all true, but I'm not under the threat of impending
     death, and I don't have a--

   [Mitchell stops, turns, and puts the lemon he's been carrying up to
   Rodney's face. Rodney stops in his tracks.]

     MCKAY
     That...

     MITCHELL
     Not yet. Keep it up.

   [He lowers the lemon.]

     MCKAY

     (shocked)
     Well, I'll see what I can come up with, then.

   [He walks away. Mitchell tosses the lemon in the air and catches it.]

     CARTER
     You know, Cam, he's not wrong. As much as it pains me to say it, the
     data from our first attempt supports his argument.

     MITCHELL
     Well, like my Grandma used to say, "if at first you don't
     succeed"...

     CARTER
     Try a larger thermo-nuclear reaction?

     MITCHELL
     Her words exactly.

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

   [Holograms of one Ancient after another appear on the platform for a
   short time each as Daniel watches. Vala sits on the floor beside the
   pedestal.]

     VALA
     Well, exciting as it is to view the Atlantis family album...

     DANIEL
     I'm looking for someone in particular.

     VALA
     I don't know of any ten-thousand-year-old Ancients.

   [They both freeze as they see a familiar elderly man appear.]

     VALA
     I take that back -- we know him!

   [She stands and pushes a button on the pedestal to activate the
   "teacher". She appears in front of the man.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Moros was the last High Councilor of Atlantis.

     VALA
     Moros. Well, apart from the funny hat, he's the spitting image of
     Merlin, isn't he?

     DANIEL
     See, in Arthur's time, that was Myrrdin. You see how a word can
     change over the centuries.

     VALA
     I know where you're going. You think the Merlin or Myrrdin or
     whatever his name was, came back to Atlantis at some stage and hid
     these names here as clues for us to find.

     DANIEL
     No.

     VALA
     No.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     The first human to set foot within the city after it was abandoned
     was Doctor Elizabeth Weir, leader of the current Atlantis
     expedition.

     VALA
     Are you sure of that?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Evidence of his presence would have been recorded.

     VALA
     Well, darling, guess that's it!

   [She slaps Daniel on the arm with both hands.]

     VALA
     We'll have to leave here with exactly that which we came here for.

     DANIEL
     No, I already knew Merlin was in the archive. I was looking for
     someone else.

     VALA
     Who?

     DANIEL

     (to hologram)
     You chose your words very carefully when you said "the first human
     to set foot in the city." What about Ascended Being?

   [The hologram shows a very sentient moment of hesitation. Daniel smiles
   faintly in recognition.]

     DANIEL
     You're not really a hologram, are you.

   [Vala looks on in surprise.]

     MORGAN LE FAY

     (making eye contact with Daniel)
     You have your answer, Daniel Jackson. I suggest you act on it.

   [She disappears, slight tendrils of light trailing her. Daniel and Vala
   exchange concerned looks.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [McKay enters carrying a portable computer.]

     MCKAY

     (excited)
     I have it! It might require a little bit of improvisation, but I
     think between the two of us, we should be able to--

     CARTER
     What have you got?

     MCKAY
     Our energy output problem isn't one of degree, it is one of
     duration. We need to calibrate an explosion with a low enough yield
     that the gate can survive, but maintain sufficiently high energy for
     there to be a cumulative effect on the matter stream. You see, when
     I first realized--

     CARTER
     We use two bombs.

     MCKAY
     Yes, I was coming to that part.

   [Emerson begins listening, alongside Mitchell.]

     CARTER
     We set the second device to detonate within a few seconds of the
     first. I'm sure you--

     MCKAY

     (deflated)
     Made the calculation, yes. They're right here.

     CARTER

     (looking at his tablet computer)
     Nice job, McKay.

     MCKAY
     Hmm, yes, well, it usually helps to threaten me.

   [He turns to glare at Mitchell, who glares back unapologetically.]

     EMERSON
     We only have four devices left.

     MCKAY
     Hmm. And we need two, so let me just do the math...

     MITCHELL
     All right, so we only have two more shots at this.

     EMERSON
     I'm also concerned that two successive blasts might overwhelm the
     stabilizer rockets. Trap the gate closer to the event horizon of the
     black hole. I'm not crazy about bringing the Odyssey in that much
     closer.

   [McKay looks pleadingly at Carter.]

     CARTER
     I think it's worth the risk.

   [McKay smiles smugly. After a moment, Emerson nods at Mitchell.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Carter and McKay)
     Do it up.

     WEIR
     What is it, Radek?

     ZELENKA
     Elizabeth, we've detected a Wraith hive ship with our long-range
     sensors.

   [He goes to a computer screen showing the situation, and she follows.]

     WEIR
     Is it headed this way?

     ZELENKA
     Toward the Odyssey.

     WEIR

     We should alert them.
     (to Technician)
     Open a channel.

     ZELENKA
     We can't. The black hole is blocking their subspace communications.

     WEIR
     Then Odyssey's sensors will also be affected.

     ZELENKA
     Most likely, along with several other systems.

     WEIR
     There is a possibility they won't see the Wraith approaching them
     until it's too late.

     ZELENKA
     That is my concern, yes.

   [Weir hesitates a moment, thinking.]

     WEIR

     (to Technician)
     Dial Earth.
     (to Zelenka)
     It's quite possible the Wraith were drawn to the nuclear blast.

     I don't think she's coming back, Daniel. Especially if you shout at
     her.

     DANIEL

     Oh, yes she is. She's come this far,
     (to the room)
     she's going to finish what she started! You're not fooling anybody
     anymore!

     Oh, hi.

     WEIR
     Hi. Who are you talking to?

     DANIEL

     (still talking mostly to the room)
     Well. I don't know what she's calling herself these days but in at
     one point in history her name was Morgan Le Fey.

     WEIR
     Morgan Le Fey was here.

     DANIEL
     Posing as a hologram, yes.

     WEIR
     Hmm. May I?

   [She moves toward the podium.]

     DANIEL
     Oh. Yes.

   [Daniel and Vala get off of the platform. Weir activates the hologram.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Hello.

     VALA
     That's her.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     You may enter your query verbally, or by entering it manually--

     DANIEL

     (annoyed)
     You know, drop the school teacher act.

     WEIR

     This is a computer-generated image of a Lantian woman who lived ten
     thousand years ago. I'm pretty familiar with the program. It hasn't
     changed.
     (to hologram)
     Question. Whose image is your avatar based on, and what's the
     purpose of your program?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     I was created by Ganos Lal, in her image, for the purpose of
     assisting younger minds.

   [Weir looks at Daniel for reaction.]

     WEIR
     And what makes you think otherwise?

     VALA
     For starters, she told us exactly what we needed to know.

     WEIR
     She did.

     VALA
     Uh huh.

     DANIEL
     Does this interface have the capability of playing back events from
     earlier in the session?

     WEIR
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     Can you play back the last sentence she said to me before she
     disappeared?

   [Weir activates the controls. The hologram changes slightly to its
   earlier position.]

     MORGAN LE FAY

     (making eye contact with Daniel)
     You have your answer, Daniel Jackson. I suggest you act on it.

   [The position of the hologram changes back to current time.]

     VALA

     (pointing)
     See, see?! Her demeanor completely changed: she looked directly at
     Daniel; it was really creepy.

     WEIR
     Well, I did warn you that she could be patronizing.

     DANIEL
     You said this device uses a lot of power. Is there any way of
     determining exactly how much power we've used?

   [Weir nods as he speaks then activates her com unit.]

     WEIR

     logs for the holo-room.

     WEIR
     I think I owe you an apology, Doctor Jackson.

   [Daniel shakes his head no. Le Fay closes her eyes for a moment, then
   begins speaking in a human way.]

     There's no need, Doctor Weir. I'm the one who should apologize.

     The second attempt was also unsuccessful. However, energy did pass

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MITCHELL

     Close but not enough.

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     Indeed.

     MCKAY
     There's still two more bombs. I say we increase the yield to
     maximum, try it again.

     CARTER
     You were the one who said a maximum-yield blast would vaporize both
     gates.

     MCKAY
     We've only got one more shot at this. What difference does it make?

     MITCHELL
     Man has a point, Sam.

   [Emerson is leaning over the console of Womack.]

     EMERSON
     Each attempt is forcing the gate closer to the event horizon of the
     black hole. To keep safe beaming distance, I'm going to have to
     bring the Odyssey in even closer.

     CARTER
     And the closer you get to the black hole, the more systems are
     affected by its effects.

     EMERSON
     Sub-light engines and beaming technology are fine, but
     communications and sensors are all out of whack already.

     Look, not a chance! It takes time to set and calibrate warheads and

     MITCHELL
     Can't do that.

     MCKAY
     Well, why not? He's a sitting duck.

     CARTER
     What Colonel Mitchell is saying is we can't allow the Ori to
     discover the secondary gate. If they do, we'll never get another
     shot at this.

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

     WEIR

     (smiling)
     You're an ascended Ancient.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     I am.

     DANIEL
     Specifically, Morgan Le Fay. I thought I recognized her from
     descriptions in the archive on Vagonbrei.

     VALA
     That's, that's great! So, enough of the tiny tidbits of information.
     Not that we're ungrateful, but um, if you know what it is we're
     looking for and, as an Ascended being, I have to assume you do...

   [As she speaks she steps forward onto the platform where Le Fay is.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     As Doctor Jackson knows, it is against our highest law to interfere.

     VALA

     (challenging)
     But interfering a little bit is fine, is it?

     WEIR
     It might be a good idea to be a bit less confrontational.

   [Daniel takes Vala by the arm and pulls her off of the platform.]

     VALA
     Well she's here chatting with us. That's interference, isn't it?

     DANIEL

     If you really are Morgan Le Fay, how do I know your intention is to
     help us? According to legend, you were Merlin's greatest rival.
     (to Weir)
     Merlin is both Moros and Myrrdin.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     For a time in your history, yes, I was his rival. But we're talking
     about many thousands of years, Doctor Jackson, as you know. Things
     change. When we first abandoned Atlantis all those millennia ago,
     the Earth was so harsh, its people so primitive by comparison, there
     was no hope of living among them as Lantians or rebuilding our
     society. So, instead we spread out to many lands, some of us
     planting a few small seeds of civilization among the first tribes of
     man. Others making their way to the Stargate at your southern pole.
     Still others choosing to live the remainder of our lives in
     seclusion and meditation. Merlin and I both chose the latter path.

     DANIEL
     And so, you ascended.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     It was only some thousands of years later, upon seeing the threat
     the Ori could one day become, that Merlin retook his human form in
     order to create the weapon that you seek. He did everything within
     his power to keep his work secret, but we feared his intentions. I
     was sent to observe, and if necessary, to stop him.

     VALA
     Wait, right there. Just a minute. If he was human again, then you
     were interfering. You broke your own law.

   [Daniel nods that she is right, but doesn't interrupt.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Merlin retained all of the knowledge he had gained while he was
     ascended, as well as many powers. Knowledge and powers he used to
     create a weapon capable of wiping Ascended Beings from existence.

     VALA
     So you're saying he cheated.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     In a manner of speaking. For that brief time in your history, he was
     the most powerful being on your planet. He created a small enclave
     of noblemen with whom he entrusted his secret.

     WEIR
     Arthur and Camelot.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     So you're telling us that, after doing everything in your power to
     oppose Merlin, all of the sudden you agree with him? Because if you
     don't, then you're deliberately misleading us.

   [The Al'kesh maneuvers to sit directly above one part of the Supergate.
   In the near distance, the ordinary Stargate sits active in space. The
   Al'kesh disappears behind a cloak, as does the Stargate.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MCKAY
     You realize the Ori ship could be there to rendezvous with a new
     fleet of ships--

     MITCHELL
     Doctor McKay. Why don't you go calibrate your bombs. That way you're
     ready when the time arrives.

   [McKay leaves quickly.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Teal'c, the cloaking field may be attenuated because you've expanded
     it. Shut down all non-mission-critical systems and maintain radio
     silence.

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

   [Teal'c begins shutting down systems, his ship going quiet.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MITCHELL
     Hopefully, they're there just to check things out. They'll be gone
     soon.

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

     MORGAN LE FAY
     I have no reason to deceive you.

     VALA
     No, of course not! So, what were you doing when you were pretending
     to be a hologram?

     MORGAN LE FAY
     The learning program I created many years before I left Atlantis
     presented itself as a means of helping you.

     WEIR
     If you'd fallen for it, you'd have your answers and be on your way,
     thinking you came up with it yourself.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     That was my intention.

     VALA
     Oh.

     DANIEL

     I believe you. I do. I mean, I understand the fine line you have to
     walk. I realize the risk you're taking just showing yourself. But
     I'm sorry, I want more. You can pass that on to your friends as
     well.
     (to room)
     Yeah, I know you're listening,
     (to Le Fay, becoming impassioned)
     because I am getting sick of hidden clues and cryptic messages. And
     Merlin was right that the Ori are a threat. But not only to us
     "lowers," not only to the billions of humans throughout this galaxy,
     but to your own existence. Because when this war is over, and every
     soul that's left alive is praying to the Ori, feeding their need to
     be worshipped, you know who they're gonna come for next. I won't
     pretend to know what that war will look like, or in what battlefield
     it will take place, but then, I won't be alive to see it.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     If we interfere, we are no better than the Ori.

     DANIEL

     (intensely)
     I understand that is at the very core of what you are, of what you
     believe, but I'm talking about survival here. If you really are
     trying to help, then help yourself.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [An Ori ship approaches the Supergate.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

   [Teal'c watches the Ori warship pass overhead from his cloaked ship.
   Teal'c's radio activates.]

     SG-11 OFFICER
     This is SG-11 com officer, relaying an urgent message via sub-space
     relay from the Gamma Site. Message reads: "From Atlantis: have
     detected Wraith ship approaching Odyssey's coordinates in Pegasus."
     Cannot relay warning directly because of interference. Advise
     Odyssey commander of danger upon receipt of this message. Original
     message received at SGC, 1545 Zulu. Good luck.

   [Teal'c appears concerned but does not take action immediately.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [McKay enters the bridge carrying his portable computer.]

     MCKAY
     The last two bombs are ready to go.

     MITCHELL
     That's great. Pick a spot and relax.

     EMERSON
     Colonel, sub-light engines are under a huge strain maintaining
     position this long.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [A Wraith ship exits hyperspace and heads toward the accretion disk.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

     MORGAN LE FAY

     You speak from the heart, Doctor Jackson. That is what I remember
     most from your brief time among us.
     (noting Daniel's surprise at the reference)
     I know you wouldn't recall, those memories were stripped from you
     when you were sent back.

     DANIEL

     (realizing her fear)
     That's what you're afraid of, isn't it? Doing the right thing and
     being punished for it.

     MORGAN LE FAY
     I've already gone too far.

     DANIEL
     But you can't be the only one to realize the Ori have changed
     things! There must be others that-that see that the time to join
     this fight is now!

   [She looks at him, troubled but impassive.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Ori warship hovers moves slowly above the circle formed by the
   gate.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

   [Teal'c activates his radio.]

     TEAL'C
     Odyssey, this is Teal'c.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Teal'c, what's the word.

     TEAL'C

     (via radio)
     A Wraith vessel is approaching your position.

     MCKAY
     Oh, Wraith. That's not good.

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     I'm sorry, how the hell do you know that?

     TEAL'C

     (via radio)
     Atlantis has detected their approach.

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     I am relaying their message via Stargate Command.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Ori ship moves along the edge of the Supergate.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     CARTER

     (at computer)
     There's no sign of a Wraith ship on the sensors.

     EMERSON

     We can't trust sensors this close to the black hole.
     (to Womack)
     Shields to maximum.

     WOMACK
     Shields are only operating at twenty percent efficiency.

     MCKAY
     It's the black hole. We need to get further away.

     EMERSON
     Move us out.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Odyssey comes under fire, its shields visible with each blast.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [A blast does some damage on the bridge. opening electrical and steam
   conduits. Mitchell grabs McKay to keep him from falling.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, there's something out there all right, we just can't see it.

     EMERSON
     Damage report!

     WOMACK
     Hyperdrive is down.

     EMERSON
     Can we return fire?

     WOMACK
     Trying, sir, but the Wraith ship is further out from the black hole
     than we are.

     EMERSON
     Emergency thrust, sub-light engines. Let's put some distance between
     us and that thing.

   [The bridge is rocked by another blast.]

     CARTER
     No, you know what, we need to do the opposite.

     MITCHELL AND MCKAY
     What?!

     CARTER
     Against a gravity well this strong, they've literally got the higher
     ground. But if we can get them to follow us closer to the black
     hole...

     MCKAY
     Then their systems will be affected the same way as ours, including
     their jamming technology.

     CARTER
     Which means we should be able to beam the warheads directly aboard
     their ship.

     EMERSON
     In that close, we won't have the engine power to maneuver.

     MITCHELL
     So we sling-shot and use the gravity well to accelerate back out.

   [Something else on the bridge explodes.]

     EMERSON

     (to Womack)
     Take us in, full power!

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Wraith ship continues to fire on the Odyssey as it heads inward
   toward the black hole.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

     DANIEL
     I know what we're asking you to do. You're afraid the others will
     step in and stop you from helping us. But maybe, maybe they just
     need someone to cross that imaginary line instead of just walking
     it. There must be others among you just waiting to follow your
     example.

     MORGAN LE FAY

     (sad but certain)
     Not enough.

     WEIR
     But you have been allowed to go this far.

     MORGAN LE FAY

     (insistent)
     Trust that you have your answers.

     VALA
     At least tell us which one of the planets to go to.

     DANIEL
     Please.

   [She hesitates for a moment then leans forward to tell them.]

     MORGAN LE FAY
     Merlin's weapon is not--

   [She is take away as her corporeal appearances fades to white. Vala
   looks on in shock while Daniel closes his eyes in sad realization.]

     WEIR

     (shocked)
     What happened?

     DANIEL
     Just what she knew would happen. They stopped her. We won't see her
     again.

     VALA

     (cringing)
     Are they going to punish her?

     DANIEL
     I don't know.

     VALA
     I think I understand why you came back, Daniel. I wouldn't have
     liked their company either.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [Odyssey speeds toward the center of the disk as the Wraith ship keeps
   firing on her.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [The bridge is taking damage.]

     WOMACK
     Shields are barely holding!

     EMERSON
     See it?

   [Mitchell and McKay are watching sensor readings on a monitor.]

     MITCHELL
     Not yet, sir.

     EMERSON
     Maintain course.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Teal'c, it's Sam. We're about to try something that will probably
     vaporize the Stargate at both ends.

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     You've got exactly twenty seconds to get your hyperdrive on line and
     get out of there.

   [Teal'c begins activating his systems. Out his viewscreen he sees the
   Ori ship heading right for him.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [Odyssey is very close to the disk, tiny beside it. It enters the disk,
   leaving a streak.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Time is passing more slowly as the people continue their efforts,
   surrounded by explosions. Carter looks for the Wraith ship on her
   sensor display, but it isn't there.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Wraith ships speeds into the disk. The Stargate floats above it,
   event horizon still active. The Odyssey sling-shots out of the disk at
   very high speed.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [A red target appears on the display.]

     MITCHELL
     There it is.

     MCKAY
     Wraith ship's in position!

   [McKay and Mitchell go to stand behind Carter.]

     CARTER
     Beaming warheads in three, two, one, mark.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Wraith ship explodes very close to the active Stargate.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [Teal'c's Al'kesh uncloaks and moves away from the Supergate. The
   regular Stargate is visible in the distance. A beam of energy leaves
   the Stargate as it did before, but this time it activates the Supergate
   and also goes to the Ori ship, which is sitting right above the circle
   of the gate. The event horizon of the Supergate forms with a huge
   whoosh, engulfing the Ori ship and causing it to blow up and come
   apart.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

   [Teal'c smiles faintly as he looks on.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR ACCRETION DISK

   [The Odyssey moves slowly in space, alone.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     CARTER
     The Wraith ship has been destroyed.

     EMERSON
     Reduce sub-light engines to one third. Let's get hyperdrive back on
     line.

     CARTER

     (looking at display)
     There's something else. I don't know how it survived the detonation,
     but...

     MCKAY
     The Stargate! It's still intact.

     CARTER
     And it's still active.

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     Odyssey, this is Teal'c.

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c, I thought we told you to get the hell out of there.

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

     TEAL'C

     (smiling, into radio)
     If I had done so, I would be unable to inform you that the jump was
     successful. The Supergate is now active.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [McKay exclaims in excitement.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Are you serious?

     TEAL'C

     (via radio)
     There is more, Colonel Mitchell.

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

   [The wreckage of the Ori ship float above him. Fires burn inside it as
   it slowly rotates.]

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     I was able to keep the Stargate concealed until the last moment and
     lure the Ori vessel into the unstable vortex of the Supergate when
     the jump occurred.

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     CARTER
     You mean we just blew up an Ori ship?

     MCKAY

     (amazed)
     By destroying a Wraith ship...

   [Mitchell and McKay exchange amazed looks.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S AL'KESH

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     Indeed we did. Today we have achieved a great victory.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   EXT--BALCONY OF ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   [Daniel and Vala look out over the railing onto the city and ocean.]

     VALA
     She did what she believed was right, Daniel. How badly can she be
     punished for that?

     DANIEL

     (sincerely)
     I don't know.

     VALA
     Maybe she'll just get a slap on the wrist. Or be forced to write "I
     will not interfere in the affairs of humans again" ten thousand
     times.

     DANIEL

     (not making eye contact)
     Yeah, I doubt that.

   [Vala sighs.]

     VALA

     (trying to cheer him)
     She said you had your answer. We found out the two addresses we came
     here for. Can you at least... smile about that?

     DANIEL
     I suppose. But we did find out something else, too.

     VALA
     What?

     DANIEL
     They're not going to help us. We're in this alone.

   FADE OUT
