   TEASER

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

   [Sound of klaxons. General Hammond hurries down the stairs. Technician
   Davis is awaiting him.]

     HAMMOND
     Report.

     TECH DAVIS
     It's SG-1, sir. They're under fire.

     HAMMOND

     (into MALP microphone)
     Colonel O'Neill, this is General Hammond. Your report status?

     O'NEILL

     (over radio)
     We're pinned down. Carter was able to dial the Gate. We're trying to
     get clear to come through.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [Through the observation window, the iris opens. Shots come through the
   Gate.]

     HAMMOND
     Evacuate the Gate room.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [SFs run from the Gate room as more shots come through the Gate.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND

     (into MALP microphone)
     Colonel O'Neill, we're taking fire. Report.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [Shots are hitting the doors, walls and destroying equipment.]

     HAMMOND

     (into MALP microphone)
     Colonel O'Neill?

     TECH
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Give them some more time.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [Daniel runs through the Gate, followed by Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill.
   The iris closes.]

   INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond is standing by the observation window. Carter, O'Neill, Daniel
   and Teal'c are sitting at the table.]

     O'NEILL
     So essentially we were ambushed on the way back to the Gate.

     CARTER
     We almost didn't make it out.

     HAMMOND
     If you delayed much longer you wouldn't have. I was about to close
     the iris.

     O'NEILL
     Well considering the SGC was taking fire, kinda glad you waited as
     long as you did, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Strictly speaking, if I'd followed procedure you'd all be dead right
     now.

     CARTER
     Well, Sir, every time we go through the Stargate it's a calculated
     risk.

     HAMMOND
     I realise that, Major. But frankly I'm getting tired of sending good
     people out there never knowing if they're going to come back. I've
     had enough.

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry, Sir, what are you saying?

     HAMMOND
     I wanted you all to be the first to know. Effective immediately I'm
     stepping down as commander of the SGC.

   OPENING TITLES

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is packing with help from a female NCO. O'Neill enters.]

     HAMMOND
     Come to see me off, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     Nope. Come to talk you out of this.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you. You can finish later.

     FEMALE NCO
     Yes, sir.

   [The female NCO leaves.]

     HAMMOND
     Jack, weren't you there for my goodbye speech?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I was. Of course. You know that. And it was lovely, General,
     but do you really think I believe you're quitting because we ran
     into a little trouble out there? Hell, we've been presumed dead
     before.

     HAMMOND
     I don't have to explain myself to you, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     No, Sir, you don't, you're my commanding officer. But could you
     throw me a bone?

     HAMMOND
     Jack, this has been a long time coming. I'm asking you to respect my
     decision and accept it. When I took over this command the Stargate
     was inactive. This was supposed to be a quick and easy assignment on
     my way to retiring.

     O'NEILL
     General, need I remind you I was retired. Some things are worth
     changing your plans for.

     HAMMOND
     I've had enough.

   [Hammond picks up a case and walks through to the Briefing room.]

   [Carter, Daniel and Teal'c are waiting.]

     HAMMOND
     Let me just say it's been a pleasure serving with all of you.

     CARTER
     We'll miss you, Sir.

   [Carter hugs Hammond.]

     DANIEL
     Won't be the same without you, Sir.

   [Daniel shakes Hammond's hand.]

     TEAL'C
     On Chulak, when a great warrior retires from the field of battle it
     is custom to sing a song of lament. Fortunately we are not on
     Chulak.

     HAMMOND
     Take care of yourselves.

   EXT--SGC, MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, DAY.

   [White cars drive into the base's entrance.]

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [All the SGC teams and staff are lined up. O'Neill, Carter, Daniel,
   Teal'c are on the front row.]

     CARTER
     So what do we know about this new guy?

     O'NEILL
     Not much.

     DANIEL
     Let's hope he's not some sort of spit and polish, brass tacks...

     O'NEILL
     Hard ass?

     DANIEL
     I was building up to that.

     O'NEILL
     Ten-hut.

   [All the soldiers stand to attention. Daniel turns. General Bauer
   enters.]

     BAUER
     My name is Major General Bauer. I'll be your new commanding officer.
     I'd just like to say I look forward to working with all of you.
     Thank you.

   [Bauer walks through the Gate room and leaves.]

     O'NEILL
     Squadron at ease. Always leave 'em wanting more. I guess.

   INT--SGC, CORRIDOR

   [Daniel and Carter are walking along the corridor.]

     DANIEL
     I don't know, I guess I was expecting someone a little more
     inspiring.

     CARTER
     I guess when you spend that much time at the Pentagon it's easy to
     become a bureaucrat.

   FOLLOW THROUGH TO CARTER'S LAB

   [Bauer is waiting inside.]

     BAUER
     Or a politician. Depends on where your interests lie.

     CARTER
     General, I...

     BAUER
     At ease, Major Carter. At ease. I've been going over your research
     into naquadah reactors. Very impressive.

     CARTER
     Well, large-scale application is mostly theoretical right now but
     the mineral does show incredible potential as an alternative power
     source.

     BAUER
     It also demonstrates some interesting properties when used in
     conjunction with nuclear ordinance.

     CARTER
     Wa...it does tend to increase the explosive effect, yes, Sir.

     BAUER
     The Pentagon feels that the Stargate project, while exposing Earth
     to considerable danger, has yet to produce any practical returns.
     Now we've been working on a device designed specifically to take
     advantage of this naquadah-enhancing effect. I'd like you to take
     part in the operation.

     CARTER
     What about my duties with SG-1?

     BAUER
     You've been reassigned.

     DANIEL
     What?

     BAUER
     As have you, Doctor Jackson. An archaeologist has no place on a
     front line unit. From now on, you'll work as a consultant, going
     offworld only as required.

     CARTER
     But, General Bauer...

     BAUER
     The decision has been made, Major. Now, I suggest you get to work.

   EXT--SGC, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BAUER'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill knocks once one on the door.]

     BAUER
     Come.

   FOLLOW THROUGH AS O'NEILL ENTERS BAUER'S OFFICE

   [A female soldier is helping him move in.]

     BAUER
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     General.

     BAUER
     Thank you, Captain.

   [The female soldier leaves.]

     BAUER
     I've just been going through your mission reports.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir?

     BAUER
     They're satisfactory, although in the future, you might want to
     include bullet-point summaries in each section. Makes for an easier
     read.

     O'NEILL
     Bullet-point summaries...

     BAUER
     Is there a problem with that?

     O'NEILL
     General, I realise the format of my reports is of vital importance
     and if you'd like, some day we can get together and talk about fonts
     and margins, but right now I like to discuss the fact you're
     dismantling my team without discussion.

     BAUER
     General Hammond might have allowed you a certain latitude in his
     presence, Colonel, but you'd do well to watch your tone with me.

     O'NEILL
     You know, General Hammond kept us together for a reason. The fact is
     if it wasn't for SG-1, right now you'd be sitting there with a snake
     in your head instead of your head up your ass...

     BAUER
     Colonel! No one around here is above reproach. If it continues your
     long history of insubordination will come to a swift and completely
     unspectacular end under my command, that I can assure you. Now I
     suggest you take some time, think things over. Decide if you still
     want to be a part of this operation. Dismissed, Colonel.

   INT--HAMMOND'S HOUSE, KITCHEN

   [Hammond is seated at the table reading a newspaper. Out of the window
   two children are playing in the garden. O'Neill walks around and greets
   the children who run to him and hug him. He hugs them back and shoos
   them off before approaching the window and putting his lips to the
   glass, leaving a 'kiss' mark there. Hammond gets up from the table and
   goes to the door to let O'Neill in.]

     HAMMOND
     Hello, Jack. Come on in.

     O'NEILL
     General. See you're keeping busy.

     HAMMOND
     Have a seat. What are you doing here?

     O'NEILL
     Ahh, little vacation.

     HAMMOND
     Didn't you just take some time off?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, this one wasn't by choice.

     HAMMOND
     Not everyone is going to be as patient with you as I was.

     O'NEILL
     That's why I'm here, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Bit of a rough adjustment?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, no, no everything's fine. SG-1's been dismantled. Daniel's got a
     desk job, Teal'c's with SG-3 and Carter's working on some kind of
     doomsday machine. You know, same old same old.

     HAMMOND
     Are you serious?

     O'NEILL
     For once, yes.

     HAMMOND
     It's just going to take some time to get used to the man. I'm sure
     he's very competent.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, come on, General. I've never met anyone who liked doing what
     they do more than you. You were good at it. Great. You'll never
     convince me you just got fed up. I'll never buy that.

     HAMMOND
     I'm sorry, it's out of my hands, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     What's that mean?

     HAMMOND
     I can't discuss it.

     O'NEILL
     General?

     HAMMOND
     You don't understand.

     O'NEILL
     I won't, unless you explain it to me.

     HAMMOND
     Two weeks ago I was contacted by a representative of the NID. He
     suggested I should become more aggressive in my policy.

     O'NEILL
     They have no jurisdiction over you.

     HAMMOND
     They wanted me to help them gain access to off world technology
     which they're unable to do since we shut down their little side
     operation.

     O'NEILL
     You told them to go to hell?

     HAMMOND
     Of course. Then he told me if I didn't cooperate there would be
     consequences. The next day, two men in plain clothes driving a black
     unmarked car picked up my granddaughters from school.

     O'NEILL
     I don't believe it.

     HAMMOND
     They took them for a little ride then brought them home. The girls
     were fine, but I got the message. We're talking about an
     organisation as powerful as the CIA. These people are above the law.
     I can't protect my family twenty-four hours a day. I had no choice.

     O'NEILL
     Of course not.

     HAMMOND
     Don't get yourself into trouble over this, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     You know me, Sir.

   INT--GOVERNMENT PRISON

   [O'Neill is let into Maybourne's cell block. Maybourne rises.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Jack O'Neill. What a pleasant surprise.

   INT--SGC, LAB

   [Some scientists are working on a bomb. Above, in the observation room,
   Carter is working. Bauer enters the observation room.]

     BAUER
     At ease. How are things progressing, Major?

     CARTER
     Well, the hardware's almost ready. But the problem is the ratio of
     naquadah to lithium hydride. According to my calculations, we don't
     have enough weapons-grade material to complete the bomb.

     BAUER
     Then we'll just have to get some more.

     CARTER
     Sir, we're talking about refined naquadah. It's extremely rare.

     BAUER
     Not on P3S-452.

     CARTER
     General, that planet is a Goa'uld stronghold.

     BAUER
     I realise that. I'm confident a well-armed strike force can get the
     job done.

   INT--GOVERNMENT PRISON, VISITING ROOM

   [O'Neill is seated at a table opposite Maybourne.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Nice of you to come by. I don't get a lot of visitors.

     O'NEILL
     I find that hard to believe.

     MAYBOURNE
     In my line of work...people don't exactly stick by you through thick
     and thin. Most of my associates are busy trying to forget they ever
     knew me.

     O'NEILL
     Your former associates are why I'm here. They're causing some
     problems for a friend of mine.

     MAYBOURNE
     General Hammond.

     O'NEILL
     What do you know?

     MAYBOURNE
     Why should I tell you?

     O'NEILL
     Because I can help you.

     MAYBOURNE
     I've been convicted of treason. What can you do?

     O'NEILL
     Air Force One and I go way back.

     MAYBOURNE
     I suppose I'll have to trust you.

     O'NEILL
     I wasn't going to say it.

     MAYBOURNE
     It's really very simple. When you shut down the offworld operation
     with the second Gate, you cut off the NID's access to alien
     technology.

     O'NEILL
     That's when they sent you to work for the Russians.

     MAYBOURNE
     The Pentagon forced the Russians to deep-six their Gate in exchange
     for continued sharing of information and technology.

     O'NEILL
     We have the only operational Gate.

     MAYBOURNE
     Exactly. The NID thinks Hammond and the policies that govern the
     Stargate program are too soft.

     O'NEILL
     So this Bauer guy is part of it?

     MAYBOURNE
     Truth is, I don't know. I've been out of the loop for a little
     while, but it's possible he's just a patsy, unwittingly manoeuvred
     into position because he's got the right mentality.

     O'NEILL
     All sounds so cloak and daggery.

     MAYBOURNE
     You're a Special Ops Colonel, Jack. Why do you always pretend to
     smell like roses?

     O'NEILL
     Hey! I never threatened a two-star general by kidnapping his
     grandkids.

     MAYBOURNE
     Don't pretend to be so naive either.

     O'NEILL
     How do I get him to back off?

     MAYBOURNE
     You really want to play in my sandbox, Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Tell me what I have to do.

     MAYBOURNE
     Quid pro quo, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     You're facing the death penalty. The best I can do is put in a good
     word, maybe recommend they commute your sentence to life.

     MAYBOURNE
     You'll have to do a lot more than that. I can get you the
     information you need--names, proof of certain influential peoples
     involvement with the NID.

     O'NEILL
     Keep talking.

     MAYBOURNE
     My word is useless. You want hard evidence, you're going to have to
     get me out of here for a few days.

     O'NEILL
     Are you nuts? Do you know how many strings I'd have to pull to make
     that happen?

     MAYBOURNE
     One big one. I know you're prepared to do it, Jack, you wouldn't be
     here otherwise. I won't bother to say you can trust me.

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

     TECH DAVIS
     Receiving transmission Sir. It's SG-3's iris code.

     BAUER
     Open the iris.

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [The iris opens. Teal'c and two members of SG-3 step through the Gate.
   One member of SG-3 is helping the other, who is injured. Three medics
   meet them at the top of the ramp. Bauer meets Teal'c at the base of the
   ramp.]

     BAUER
     Where's Major Waite?

     TEAL'C
     Dead.

     BAUER
     What happened?

     TEAL'C
     We encountered heavy resistance. Lieutenant Morrison was providing
     cover fire.

     BAUER
     What about the naquadah?

     TEAL'C
     I believe I secured a sufficient amount.

     BAUER
     Excellent.

   [Teal'c walks off.]

     BAUER
     You can give me your full briefing later.

     MEDIC'S VOICE

     (in background)
     We've stopped the bleeding. Let's get him to the infirmary.

   EXT--YELLOW BRICK APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY

   INT--EMPTY APARTMENT

   [O'Neill and Maybourne enter. It's sparsely furnished--a table with a
   desktop computer, a chair, a microwave and a fridge.]

     O'NEILL
     Have you heard of Ikea?

     MAYBOURNE
     You want to feel privileged Jack. No one, not even the NID knows
     about this place.

   [O'Neill picks up a letter from a pile of letters on the floor.]

     O'NEILL
     Charles Bliss?

     MAYBOURNE
     Now you know one of a hundred names I go by.

   [Maybourne goes to the fridge. The only thing in there is loads of
   bottles of beer and a bottle of mustard.]

     O'NEILL
     I see you're on that famous beer and mustard diet. How's that
     working out for you?

   [Maybourne takes two beers from the fridge and offers one to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     No thanks.

   [Maybourne puts the beer back and removes a wrapped floppy disk taped
   to the top of the fridge. He walks to the table and sits down, turning
   on the computer.]

     MAYBOURNE
     If anyone tries to boot the computer up without this disk the whole
     thing fries.

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing?

     MAYBOURNE
     Accessing NID files on the Internet.

     O'NEILL
     On the Internet?

     MAYBOURNE
     The organisation is made up of cells. They communicate with each
     other by accessing bulletin boards online. Information is deposited
     on any number of firewall-protected floating servers and accessed
     using decoding software and passwords.

     O'NEILL
     Yadda yadda. Blah blah. Why'd we have to come here for this?

     MAYBOURNE
     Because the decoding software happens to be on this computer.
     They've deactivated my password.

     O'NEILL
     Now there's a shocker.

     MAYBOURNE
     I'll try to hack in through the back door.

   INT--SGC, BAUER'S OFFICE

   [Bauer is seated behind his desk. Carter is standing in front of it.]

     CARTER
     The naquadah we got from P3S-452 has been successfully incorporated
     into the device.

     BAUER
     I'm glad to hear it. Here's the test site.

   [Bauer hands Carter a file. Carter reads a couple of pages.]

     CARTER
     This planet supports plant and animal life.

     BAUER
     Yes. But the aerial survey shows no sign of habitation within a
     fifty-mile radius of the Gate.

     CARTER
     That may not be good enough. I'll need some time to run some
     simulations. Sir, we've never done anything like this before and I'm
     not entirely sure how destructive the device will be.

     BAUER
     Major, the whole point of the experiment is to determine how
     destructive the device will be. Request denied.

     CARTER
     But Sir...

     BAUER
     Proceed with the preparations.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

   INT--MAYBOURNE'S APARTMENT

   [Maybourne is siting at the table operating the computer. O'Neill is at
   the window.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Jack? Once you've got the information that links the key names to
     the NID, what are you going to do with it?

     O'NEILL
     What do you think?

     MAYBOURNE
     I think you're going to turn it over to the Pentagon and hope that
     the proper chain of command leads to justice.

     O'NEILL
     Are you tryin' to say something to me, Harry?

     MAYBOURNE
     You can't take down the whole NID and they'll kill you for trying.

     O'NEILL
     That wouldn't be very nice.

     MAYBOURNE
     But you might be able to hold the incriminating evidence over them
     and get Hammond reinstated.

     O'NEILL
     So I should sit on this?

     MAYBOURNE
     It's your play.

   [We see on the screen that Maybourne's password has been rejected.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Damn.

   [Sound of cars pulling up outside. O'Neill looks out of the window and
   sees men getting out of the cars.]

     O'NEILL
     Thought you said nobody knew about this place.

     MAYBOURNE
     They've probably been tracing me since I went online.

     O'NEILL
     You got a way out of here?

     MAYBOURNE
     Gimme a second.

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing?

     MAYBOURNE
     Burning the hard drive.

   INT--MAYBOURNE'S APARTMENT

   [Several armed men burst in. They search the apartment quickly and find
   a secret door but O'Neill and Maybourne are gone.]

   EXT--STREET, DAY

   [Maybourne walks across the road in front of the other car. The driver
   gets out of the car and O'Neill knocks him unconscious from behind.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Nice.

   [Maybourne tries to pick up the gun the driver dropped.]

     O'NEILL
     And a nice try to you.

   [O'Neill picks up the gun. They get into the car and drive off.]

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [Carter and Siler are preparing the bomb.]

     CARTER
     We're ready, Sir.

     BAUER

     (in control room, over speaker)
     First observation MALP is in position. Prepare to send the bomb
     through.

     CARTER
     Seal it up.

   EXT--PARK, HOT DOG STAND, DAY

   [O'Neill is on the phone while Maybourne gets a hot dog.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah Daniel. How are things at camp?

   INT--SGC, DANIEL'S LAB

     DANIEL
     Erm, not good. General Bauer's testing his new naquadah bomb. He's
     taking shortcuts which Sam thinks could be disastrous.

   EXT--PARK, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Well, Maybourne claims he doesn't know whether Bauer's in with NID
     or just a gung-ho patsy.

   INT--SGC, DANIEL'S LAB

     DANIEL
     Yeah, well, either way he's dangerous.

   EXT--PARK, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Well hang in there, do what you can. I'll check back.

   [O'Neill hangs up and joins Maybourne at a table. Maybourne offers him
   a hot dog.]

     MAYBOURNE
     You want one?

     O'NEILL
     No. You know, there's still something about you that puts me off my
     food.

     MAYBOURNE
     I know you've got a strong stomach, Jack. I've read your file.

     O'NEILL
     Now what does that have to do with anything?

     MAYBOURNE
     You want to help General Hammond, you're going to have to get your
     hands dirty. I need to know you're going to see this thing through.

     O'NEILL
     Under no other circumstances would I sit here and watch you eat.

     MAYBOURNE
     Yeah, well, things are about to get a lot more dicey. They're onto
     us. Our only chance now is a more direct approach.

     O'NEILL
     Such as?

     MAYBOURNE
     We have to connect someone with significant influence to the online
     websites. The only way to do that now is straight through one of the
     high profile associates.

     O'NEILL
     Who are we talking about here?

     MAYBOURNE
     An old friend.

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

   [Sound of klaxons. Siler is sitting at a control computer, Carter is
   standing near him. We see on a screen that the MALP with the bomb is
   travelling over sand on the test site planet.]

     SILER
     Fifteen minutes to target location.

   [Daniel rushes in.]

     DANIEL
     We have to stop the test.

     BAUER
     Why is that, Doctor?

     DANIEL
     The aerial survey shows evidence of an old Goa'uld mining operation.
     Now even though it's probably been shut down for several thousand
     years there could still be significant amounts of naquadah present
     on that planet.

     BAUER
     My soil samples indicate only minute traces.

     CARTER
     The geological survey I read said there was none.

     BAUER
     We're not stopping the test.

     CARTER
     I don't think you realise the implications of this. Or maybe you do.

     BAUER
     Are you making an accusation, Major?

     CARTER
     You knew all along, didn't you? You were hoping for a chain reaction
     with the naquadah in the soil. Sir, that entire planet could be
     destroyed.

     BAUER
     That possibility has been considered. Most worlds occupied by the
     Goa'uld do have a high incidence of naquadah. This could be a very
     effective weapon against them.

     CARTER
     There's only one problem, Sir. When that bomb goes off we'll still
     be connected to that planet by an active Stargate and we've seen
     radiation, gravitational effects, even time distortions translated
     back through an outgoing wormhole.

     BAUER
     According to my intelligence, we should be able to get just enough
     data before the Stargate is destroyed and the wormhole disconnected.

     CARTER
     Who provided this intelligence?

     BAUER
     That is not your concern.

     CARTER
     Sir, we've seen the Stargate survive a direct hit from a meteorite.
     The truth is, we have no way of knowing what might happen.

     BAUER
     A risk assessment has been made and deemed acceptable. End of
     discussion.

   EXT--SENATOR KINSEY'S HOUSE, DAY

   [O'Neill and Maybourne drive up.]

     O'NEILL
     How long you known the guy?

     MAYBOURNE
     We go way back.

   EXT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, ENTRANCE, DAY

   [O'Neill and Maybourne stand on the front step. Sounds of piano playing
   and people inside the house. Maybourne rings the doorbell.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Looks like a party.

   [The door is opened by a maid.]

     MAID
     Yes?

     MAYBOURNE
     Would you please tell the Senator that Colonel Maybourne and Colonel
     O'Neill would like to see him.

     MAID
     He has guests.

     MAYBOURNE
     Tell him he has two more.

   [Kinsey comes to the door.]

     KINSEY
     What the hell are you doing here?

     MAYBOURNE
     Our invitations must have got lost in the mail.

     KINSEY
     This is not a good time.

   [Mrs. Kinsey approaches behind Kinsey.]

     MRS. KINSEY
     Who is it, dear?

     KINSEY
     A couple of old friends.

     O'NEILL
     Afternoon ma'am. I'm Mr. Starsky and this is...Hutch.

     MRS. KINSEY
     Come in, come in. We're just having a little get-together.

   [They enter the house. A dog runs over to O'Neill.]

     KINSEY

     (to dog)
     Oscar, down.

     O'NEILL
     It's all right.

     MRS. KINSEY
     He seems to like you, Mr. Starsky.

     O'NEILL
     Birds of feather, ma'am.

     KINSEY
     Dear, Starsky and Hutch is an old TV show.

     MRS. KINSEY
     Oh, so you're actors then?

     KINSEY
     Maybe we'd better go up to my study. This won't take long.

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

     SILER
     The weapon is in position.

   [Bauer detonates the weapon using a remote control. On the computer
   screen we see the bomb explode. Then the MALP camera feed is lost.]

     DANIEL
     What happened?

     SILER
     We've lost transmission.

     CARTER
     The observation MALP was destroyed.

     TEAL'C
     The wormhole did not disconnect.

     TECH DAVIS
     Sir, I'm picking up increasing levels of radiation in the Gate room.

     CARTER
     They're gamma rays, ultrahigh frequency.

     BAUER
     Shut down the Gate.

     TECH DAVIS
     No response. Radiation levels approaching critical.

     CARTER
     Close the iris.

   [The iris closes.]

     TECH DAVIS
     Radiation levels decreasing.

     CARTER
     Sir, if that iris succumbs to the heat and loses integrity, there
     will be no way to stop the radiation from bombarding the base. We
     have to evacuate.

     BAUER
     We were positive the other Gate would be destroyed.

     CARTER
     Sir, we have act now.

     CARTER

     (over speaker)
     Attention all personnel, by order of General Bauer commence
     immediate evacuation of the base. Repeat, immediate evacuation. This
     is not a drill.

   [Alarm sounds.]

     CARTER
     We can monitor the Gate room from a security station on Level 16.

     BAUER
     What's going to happen, Major?

     CARTER
     I have no way of knowing, Sir.

     DANIEL
     Guess your risk assessment didn't cover this.

   [Daniel walks off.]

   INT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, THE STUDY

   [Kinsey closes the door. O'Neill and Maybourne are standing inside the
   room.]

     KINSEY
     Gentlemen, I have the undersecretary of state, the governor of
     Maryland and half the United States Congress waiting for me in my
     living room, so let's make this quick. What in God's name could I
     possibly do for you?

     O'NEILL
     We need some information on the NID.

     KINSEY
     The NID?

     O'NEILL
     Snaky government agency involved in all sorts of illegal covert
     operations, like blackmailing Air Force generals.

     KINSEY
     You are making less and less sense to me as the seconds are passing
     away, along with my patience.

     MAYBOURNE
     Don't tell me you're not aware of all the money they funnelled into
     your re-election campaign?

     KINSEY
     If you have a problem with my campaign finances, why don't you take
     it up with the Federal Elections Commission?

     MAYBOURNE
     That's just the tip of the iceberg.

     KINSEY
     And aren't you supposed to be in a federal prison, Colonel?

     MAYBOURNE
     Colonel O'Neill graciously asked to President to help me dig up some
     information about my former associates.

     KINSEY
     And you trust this man?

     O'NEILL
     No.

   [O'Neill looks at Maybourne apologetically.]

     KINSEY
     I'm sorry, gentlemen, but this conversation has lost all amusement
     for me. I have a party to get back to.

     O'NEILL
     We're not going anywhere.

     KINSEY
     Excuse me?

     O'NEILL
     I'm not leaving until I get what I came for.

     KINSEY
     Oh, and what are you going to do?

     O'NEILL
     Well, I was thinking about shooting you.

   [O'Neill produces and aims a gun at Kinsey.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Jack, what are you doing?

     O'NEILL
     Getting a little dirty for you, Maybourne?

   INT--SGC, SECURITY STATION

   [Carter, Bauer, Teal'c and Daniel enter and switch on the lights.
   Carter sits down at the controls.]

     CARTER
     Bringing the Gate room online. The iris is still holding, but it's
     starting to heat up.

     BAUER
     How long before it loses integrity?

     CARTER
     I'm not sure. It's possible that we turned that planet into a giant
     ball of super heated plasma. It could power the Gate for months.

     BAUER
     We'll have to set the autodestruct.

     TEAL'C
     The Gate on the other side survived the explosion. Would not ours as
     well?

     BAUER
     But at least it would be buried under a million tonnes of rock.

     CARTER
     That wouldn't stop it from pumping out radiation. Eventually the
     heat is going to melt through that iris.

     BAUER
     Then what do we do, Major?

     CARTER
     There is a chance the Gate will shut down on its own.

     BAUER
     The 38-minute window.

     CARTER
     There's no way to know for sure, Sir. These are untested
     circumstances.

     BAUER
     How long has the Gate been open?

     CARTER
     Coming up on twenty-one minutes.

   INT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, THE STUDY

   [Kinsey is standing with O'Neill holding a gun on him. Maybourne is
   seated behind the desk operating the computer.]

     KINSEY
     Colonel, have you completely taken leave of your senses?

     O'NEILL
     I've been hanging round Maybourne. What does that say?

     KINSEY
     How dare you come into my house waving a gun?

     O'NEILL
     Not waving. Pointing. Sit down.

   [Kinsey sits.]

     KINSEY
     I hope you realise, Colonel, you are making the biggest mistake of
     your life. When this is over, I promise you'll regret the day we
     ever met.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, that day has come and gone, Senator.

     KINSEY
     If you don't care about your own career, maybe you should think
     about your friends.

     O'NEILL
     What's that mean?

     KINSEY
     You mess with me, Dr. Jackson will be out of the SGC permanently,
     and Major Carter will be scrubbing toilets in some Air Force weather
     station in Alaska--and as for the alien, Teal'c, well, let's just
     say I know some bioengineers in the Department of Defence who would
     love to get their hands on his symbiote.

     MAYBOURNE
     Okay, I'm in. I need the password.

     O'NEILL
     I'll give you a choice: white meat or dark meat?

     KINSEY
     You wouldn't dare.

     MAYBOURNE
     It's usually something familiar, like, er, wife's maiden name.

     KINSEY
     I have a wife, three children, seven grandchildren and various
     nieces and nephews. Good Luck.

   [O'Neill spots a photo of Kinsey, his wife and dog on the desk.]

     O'NEILL
     Try Oscar.

   [Kinsey makes a face.]

     MAYBOURNE
     That's it, we're in. I'm downloading now. Kinsey's online activities
     connect him to NID actions over the last year and a half. Including
     the secret operation I ran out of Area 51, the involvement with the
     Russians...and the threats to Hammond.

     O'NEILL
     You're a piece of work, Kinsey. Try to shut down the SGC, you make
     this big speech about how much you hate secret organisations and
     then you jump in bed with the NID. What is that?

     KINSEY
     Oh, I still think the Gate is a Pandora's box and I still think it
     should be buried forever, but as long it's open and as long as it's
     a threat to this planet, then I'm damn well going to make sure its
     used the way it should be used. To defend God's creation.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, blow the rhetoric up somebody else's nose. You're nothing but a
     power-hungry hypocrite.

     KINSEY
     The only currency in this town is power. So if I have to shake hands
     with the Devil to do the Lord's work, then so be it.

     O'NEILL
     You self-righteous son of a bitch. Where do you get off...

     KINSEY
     Judge not lest ye be judged. I read the mission reports that come
     out of that mountain. You play with the fate of this planet on a
     daily basis.

     O'NEILL
     I'm doing the job I was asked to do. I doubt very much your
     constituents could say the same about you.

     KINSEY
     Oh please! Given the chance half of all American citizens won't even
     vote and the half that do vote are too stupid to know what they're
     doing.

     O'NEILL
     Which explains how you got elected.

     KINSEY
     In order to expose me, you're going to have to compromise the
     secrecy of the SGC. Are you really willing to do that?

     MAYBOURNE
     I'm done.

   [Maybourne takes a disk from the computer.]

     O'NEILL
     Give me that.

     KINSEY
     What are you going to do? Take down the whole NID?

     O'NEILL
     Nope. Here's the deal. Get them to reinstate Hammond or this disk
     goes to the press.

     KINSEY
     It'll never see the light of day.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I really don't think you'll see the light of day if your
     secret friends find out you're the weak link.

     KINSEY
     You learned to play hardball pretty fast didn't you, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     I had a good teacher.

   [Out of the window, Maybourne sees black cars approaching.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Trouble, Jack.

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM.

   [The iris is glowing red.]

   INT--SGC, SECURITY STATION

   [Carter is seated at the controls. Bauer, Teal'c and Daniel are
   standing.]

     CARTER
     Approaching 38 minutes.

   INT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, THE STUDY

     MAYBOURNE
     Who made the call? Your wife?

     KINSEY
     Give me the disk and you might just get out of here alive.

     O'NEILL
     They won't come in here with the group he's got downstairs.

     MAYBOURNE
     But we still got to get out.

   [O'Neill takes his cell phone from his pocket and dials.]

   INT--SGC, SECURITY STATION

   [The computer screen indicates 38 minutes have passed.]

     BAUER
     It's still open.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

     BAUER
     Well, there's no point staying here. I'll inform the President from
     the surface.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir, I'm sure it'll be much safer up there.

   [Carter rises and leaves the room, Daniel follows. Teal'c is about to
   leave when he sees on the screen that the Gate has deactivated.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter?

   [They all come back into the room.]

     BAUER
     What happened?

     CARTER
     The Gate shut itself off.

     BAUER
     Are you sure?

     CARTER
     It's over.

     BAUER
     For what it's worth, Major, I'm sorry.

   INT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, THE STAIRCASE

   [Kinsey, O'Neill and Maybourne descend the stairs.]

     O'NEILL
     Great party, Mrs. K. Thank you.

   EXT--KINSEY'S HOUSE, DAY

   [The front door opens. The men from the black cars start toward the
   door. Suddenly, a herd of reporters runs to the front of the house.
   Maybourne and O'Neill leave through the throng of reporters while
   Kinsey signals the men in black to do nothing. Kinsey comes out to
   stand on the front patio.]

     REPORTER 1
     Senator Kinsey, we have heard you are planning to run for the White
     House.

     KINSEY
     White House?

     REPORTER 2
     Are you declaring your candidacy?

     KINSEY
     Well, this is really not how I intended this to come out.

     REPORTER 3
     So it's true then, Senator?

     KINSEY
     Well, now that you're all here, we've often talked about my goals.
     Do I think I would make a good president? You're damn right I would.
     You know how I feel about things. You know how hard I've worked.

   [O'Neill and Maybourne walk past the men in black to their car.]

     KINSEY
     The potential I see in the people of this great nation and the way
     so many of it's leaders have let them down. It's enough to bring
     tears to your eyes. The solution to the problems by our government
     are so simple. Listen to the people.

   [O'Neill and Maybourne drive off.]

   INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond is standing looking out at the Gate through the window. Then
   he walks toward his office.]

   FOLLOW THROUGH TO INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill knocks on the wall.]

     HAMMOND
     Jack, come in.

     O'NEILL
     General, it's good to have you back.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you. I hear I missed a bit of excitement while I was gone.

     O'NEILL
     You'll have to ask Carter about that, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     I'm looking forward to the debriefing.

     O'NEILL
     As am I.

     HAMMOND
     Jack, what do I owe you for this?

     O'NEILL
     Continued latitude, patience and understanding. So just be yourself,
     Sir.

   [Sound of the phone ringing. Hammond answers it.]

     HAMMOND
     Hammond...It's for you.

   [Hammond hands the receiver to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello.

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

   [Maybourne is on the phone, a steel band playing in the background.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Hello, Jack.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     Maybourne. Where are you?

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     Well, not in jail, if that's what you think.

   [Maybourne holds the phone up to the steel band.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill looks peeved.]

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     I e-mailed myself a copy of the incriminating evidence when I saved
     it to disk for you.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     I know.

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     Kinsey felt obligated to get me transferred to a nicer facility
     while I await my execution. Made things simple after that.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't you try to escape when you were with me?

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     Oh, come on, Jack, you trusted me. I didn't want you to look bad for
     the president. Besides you're too good to have let it happen.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     What are you going to do now?

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     Well, short term, I think I'll have a few margaritas. After that,
     who knows?

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Right.

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

     MAYBOURNE
     Thanks for all your help.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill puts the phone down.]

     O'NEILL
     General, about what you owe me?

     HAMMOND
     Anything I can do.

     O'NEILL
     Well, nothing right now. But one day I may ask you to...buy back my
     soul.

   EXT--A TROPICAL ISLAND, DAY

   [Maybourne puts his arm around a local woman and dances off to the
   sound of the steel band.]
