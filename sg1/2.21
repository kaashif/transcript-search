   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The camera pulls away from a shot of the inactive Stargate over to
   Daniel, O'Neill, and Teal'c, who have all their gear and are ready to
   go. O'Neill looks up at the control room, and we cut to see a view of
   the control room through the window, where Carter is still fiddling
   with calculations on the computers. Cut back to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     (quietly, to Daniel)
     What is she doing?

     DANIEL
     Uh, she said something about having to time the calculations exactly
     right this time of year.

     O'NEILL
     This time of year? What difference does it make?

     DANIEL

     Oh, she said something about solar...
     (pauses, confused)
     uh...well, to be honest with you, I wasn't really paying attention.

     O'NEILL
     Really?

   [He turns and shouts up to the control room]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

   [She looks up and leans into the microphone.]

     CARTER

     (over microphone)
     Almost there, sir. This time of year, the direct line between
     P2X-555 and the Earth takes us within 70,000 miles of the sun. I
     have to update the computer's drift calculation to include
     gravitational space/time warping.

     O'NEILL

     (after a beat)
     We know that. Let's go!

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter finishes the calculations and walks over to where two
   technicians are waiting. As she does so, Hammond comes down the steps
   and into the control room.]

     CARTER

     (to technician)
     You can start the dialing procedure.

   [He nods and moves to take his place at the controls. Carter turns to
   exit, and is surprised to find Hammond standing in her path.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

     HAMMOND

     (looks down)
     How's the hand?

   [He reaches down and takes her right hand to inspect it. Cut to a shot
   of Carter's hand. There is a nasty gash on the back of her hand, from
   the webbing between her thumb and forefinger to her wrist. It's been
   stitched and taped, but the skin around the cut is purplish and
   bruised.]

     CARTER
     It's a little sore, but it'll be all right. Thank you.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron one, encoded.

   [Hammond holds up a small yellow piece of paper, folded in half.]

     HAMMOND
     I'd like you to take this note along with you. Keep it in your vest
     pocket until you get on the other side.

   [He hands the note to her.]

     HAMMOND
     It's fairly self-explanatory.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron two, encoded.

     CARTER

     (confused)
     Sir, is everything all right?

     HAMMOND
     Everything's fine.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron three, encoded.

     HAMMOND
     Time to ship out, Captain.

     CARTER

     (putting note in vest pocket)
     Yes, sir.

   [Hammond steps aside to let her pass, and she heads out of the control
   room, still baffled by his behavior.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron four, encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Carter enters the bay doors, shouldering her gun as she comes up to
   the rest of SG-1.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron five, encoded.

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Ah! Done already?

   [In the control room, Hammond moves to stand beside the technician,
   looking down at SG-1 in the Gate room. Carter glances up to see him
   standing there.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron six, encoded.

   [View of the Stargate as the final chevron is encoded. Cut to a shot of
   the computer screen, which shows the seventh chevron coming "out" from
   the representation of the Gate. Cut to the Gate as the last chevron
   locks, and then cut back to the computer as the last chevron moves into
   the sequence on the right side of the screen and the words "SEQUENCE IN
   PROGRESS" are replaced by "SEQUENCE COMPLETE."]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron seven, locked.

   [In the control room. As the wormhole activates, Hammond is still
   standing there, looking expectantly down at the team as though there's
   something he wants to tell them. Cut to the Gate room, as SG-1 stands
   at the base of the ramp. Carter is still looking up at the control room
   curiously. As O'Neill and Daniel start up the ramp, Teal'c and Carter
   follow them, Carter pulling her cap on as she does. They step into the
   wormhole.<]

   INT--MISSILE LAUNCH ROOM

   [As SG-1 emerge from the wormhole, cut to what looks like the same
   Stargate they just entered, in the Gate room. Carter and Teal'c glance
   back at the wormhole as O'Neill leads the confused team down the ramp,
   glancing back as well. The four of them step off the ramp, and O'Neill
   turns back again to stare at the Gate. As he does so, the wormhole
   shuts off--taking the Stargate with it.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Whoa!

   [The others turn as the entire Gate and the back wall behind it ripple
   away and outward just as the wormhole does, leaving a darkened section
   where the back wall should be.]

     O'NEILL
     Did you see that?

   [The other three walls ripple away similarly. The familiar surroundings
   of the Gate room melt away to reveal an underground launch pad.
   Unaffected by the change, SG-1 is left standing on the launch pad,
   confused.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, Jack, do you see this?

   [O'Neill looks up. Cut to an overhead shot of the team, which reveals
   that they're standing below what look to be rocket engines and
   nozzles.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain Carter, where are we?

   [In a wider-angle shot of the room, showing a huge missile which
   extends out of the frame in the dimly lit room. The camera pans down to
   show that SG-1 standing on the launch pad directly beneath the
   missile.]

     CARTER
     I don't know, sir. For a minute there, we were back in the Gate
     room.

   [O'Neill walks to one side of the launch pad, trying to get a better
   look at what they're standing beneath.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, this looks suspiciously like the butt end of a Titan
     missile.

     PA SYSTEM
     Standing by for test burn in T-minus 20 seconds.

   [At that, O'Neill straightens, alarmed. The whine of generators
   starting up can be heard.]

     TEAL'C
     What is a 'test burn'?

     O'NEILL
     Just what it sounds like.

   [He and Carter hurry off the launch pad.]

     O'NEILL
     Any ideas here?

   [He runs to the nearest bay door, pounding on it frantically.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Abort!

   [He runs to the control box next to the door, still pounding.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Abort!

   Daniel jumps off the launch pad, checking the perimeter of the room for
   a door that will open. Carter checks a series of electrical sockets.
   Teal'c remains on the launch pad, looking up at the missile. Having no
   luck with the electric sockets, Carter moves to fiddle with one of the
   meters nearby.]

     PA SYSTEM
     15 seconds.

   [O'Neill pounds on the control box, messing with the dials in a
   desperate attempt to affect something.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Abort!

   [Teal'c removes his zatnicatel from his vest.]

     PA SYSTEM
     Stand by for ignition.

   [Carter runs over to help O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Abort!

   [On the other side of the room, Daniel ineffectually tries to tear a
   fuse box from the wall. Teal'c activates the zatnicatel.]

     PA SYSTEM
     10...9...8...

   [Teal'c lifts the zatnicatel, aiming it at the smoking missile above
   him.]

     PA SYSTEM
     7...6...5...

   [Daniel gives up and dives for cover, covering his head with his arms.
   Carter and O'Neill flatten themselves against the wall, their backs to
   the missile.]

     PA SYSTEM
     4...3...

   [Teal'c fires the zatnicatel. Tendrils of blue-white energy stream over
   the missile.]

     PA SYSTEM
     2...1. Ignition.

   [Nothing happens. Teal'c stands there, zatnicatel still raised. After a
   second or two, Carter and O'Neill lift their heads. Teal'c lowers the
   zatnicatel, shutting it off, as O'Neill and Carter turn and stare at
   the missile. Realizing they're all right, Daniel gets to his feet and
   comes over to O'Neill and Carter. All three stare at Teal'c in
   amazement.]

     O'NEILL
     How'd you know that would work?

     TEAL'C
     I did not.

   [A buzzer goes off, and the bay doors behind O'Neill slide open. Three
   armed soldiers rush into the room, aiming guns at SG-1.]

     SOLDIER
     Hands on your heads! Get on your knees!

   [Stunned, Carter, O'Neill and Daniel obey, and Teal'c kneels down on
   the floor beside them. The camera closes in on a very confused SG-1.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--MISSILE LAUNCH ROOM

   [SG-1 is still kneeling on the floor with their hands on their heads,
   surrounded by armed soldiers. All are pointing rifles at them, and none
   of them look friendly. The soldier in charge stands in front of them,
   training his rifle on SG-1.]

     SERGEANT
     Who are you and how did you get into this facility?

     O'NEILL

     (confused)
     What facility?

     SERGEANT
     Answer the question.

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Sir, don't say anything. This is the Gate room.

     SERGEANT
     Shut up!

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Sir, we're still in Cheyenne Mountain.

     SERGEANT
     The next person who shoots his mouth off gets this.

   [He gestures with his gun]

     SERGEANT
     Is that clear?

   [Above them, an intercom switches on.]

     MAN

     (over intercom)
     Take them to the holding room.

     SERGEANT

     (glancing up)
     Yes, sir.

     O'NEILL
     No, take me to your C.O.

   [At that, the soldier swings his rifle around, slamming the butt of the
   rifle into O'Neill's face. O'Neill goes down from the force of the
   blow, and Carter lowers her hands for a moment.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM

   [Cut to an assorted spread of weaponry and supplies--those belonging to
   SG-1--laid out on a table. They've obviously been confiscated. A hand
   enters the frame to pick up one of the zatnicatels. The camera pans up
   to show us the owner of the hand, a young lieutenant, and the sergeant
   who struck O'Neill standing beside the table in a storage room. Next to
   the spread of weapons is a cardboard box containing the vests. The
   lieutenant studies the zatnicatel curiously.]

     SERGEANT
     The Major wants all this stowed for transport, sir.

     LIEUTENANT

     (re: the zatnicatel)
     What is it?

     SERGEANT
     My orders are to forget I ever saw it, sir, so I'm afraid I don't
     know what you're talking about.

     LIEUTENANT
     Thank you, Sergeant.

   [The sergeant nods and exits. The lieutenant reaches into the box and
   pulls out Carter's vest, starting to go through it--and stops, noticing
   a yellow piece of paper sticking out of one of the pockets. Curious, he
   pulls out the paper and sets the vest aside, studying the note. The
   outside of the note is addressed simply to "George." The lieutenant
   unfolds the note all the way. Inside is the following message:

   HELP THEM.

   AUGUST 10TH 9:15 AM AUGUST 11TH 6:03 PM

   The lieutenant's eyes narrow as he reads the note, seeing something
   important in the cryptic message.]

   INT--HOLDING CELL

   [Daniel is leaning against one of the bunk beds, and O'Neill is sitting
   on the bottom bunk of the other, rubbing his eyes. Carter and Teal'c
   are sitting at the table.</blockquote>

     CARTER

     I'm fairly certain that we've traveled back in time, roughly about
     thirty years.
     (as O'Neill looks up)
     For a second or two, I think we were in both time-frames
     simultaneously, which is why the Stargate seemed to be there one
     minute and was gone the next.

     O'NEILL
     Little bump in the calculations, Captain?

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what to say.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I'll tell you what. Get us back home and we'll say it never
     happened.

     DANIEL
     Or get us back before we left and it won't happen.

   [Carter and Teal'c turn to stare at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Well, think about it. We're the first people in human history to go
     back in time, well, for all we know. If we could figure out how to
     do this again, just think of what we could do. We could actually
     visit Babylon, we could--we could--we could see the Great Wall of
     China being built.

     TEAL'C
     Or prevent regrettable events from your history from ever occurring.

     CARTER

     (alarmed)
     No! That's exactly what we can't do.

     O'NEILL
     Why not?

     CARTER

     Because of the grandfather paradox.
     (at his blank look)
     If you went back fifty years and murdered your own grandfather, your
     own father would never have been born.

     DANIEL
     So you're saying that if we change our own past...

     CARTER
     We could change our world in ways that we can't possibly imagine. We
     might even cease to exist, along with everything and everyone we
     know.

     TEAL'C
     I myself have no part in the history of your world.

     CARTER
     But, when they find out about the Goa'uld threat, they might have
     second thoughts about opening the Stargate in the first place. In
     which case, we never meet...and you're back to being First Prime of
     Apophis.

     TEAL'C

     (realizing)
     I see.

     DANIEL
     So...we don't tell them about the Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     How do we explain the larval Goa'uld that Teal'c is carrying? Our
     advanced weapons, our GDO's?

     O'NEILL
     Correct me if I'm wrong, Captain, but--haven't we altered history
     already just by being here?

     CARTER
     We have to concentrate on damage control. At the very least, destroy
     our advanced weapons and technology.

     O'NEILL
     That's going to be a little tough.

     CARTER

     We also cannot tell anyone anything
     (holding up SGC patch)
     about who we are or where we're from.

     O'NEILL
     This is a top secret facility. Anonymity does not go over big here.

     CARTER

     (serious)
     We cannot tell them we're from the future, sir. Even if it means...

   [She stops short as the cell door is unlocked, opening to admit two
   guards holding guns and one other soldier. The soldier approaches
   Daniel, the closest one to the door.]

     SOLDIER

     (speaking Russian)
     You Soviet spies?

     DANIEL

     Nyet.
     (Translation: No.)

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     He just asked if we were Soviet spies. I just...

   [He stops, realizing his error. O'Neill gives him a look, unable to
   believe this one.]

     SOLDIER

     (to O'Neill)
     Come with me.

     O'NEILL

     Sure.
     (gets up)
     You bet.
     (walking out door, to himself)
     "Nyet?"

   [The first two soldiers escort O'Neill out as Daniel walks over to the
   nearest bunk bed and puts his head in his hand on the top bunk. The
   third soldier closes the cell door behind them.]

   INT--BASE INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Major Thornbird, the base commander, lights a cigarette. Cut to a shot
   of the interrogation room, in the center of which is a small wooden
   table with a harsh lamp shining directly over the table. Thornbird sits
   at one end of the table, with an ash tray by his right hand. O'Neill
   sits at the other end. A guard stands watch at the door. The smoke from
   Thornbird's cigarette permeates the room.]

     THORNBIRD
     I'm Major Robert Thornbird. And you are?

   [O'Neill coughs at the smoke before replying.]

     O'NEILL

     (calmly)
     Captain James T. Kirk, of the Starship Enterprise.

     THORNBIRD
     Eh...your dog tags say otherwise.

     O'NEILL
     They're lying.

     THORNBIRD

     Your American accent is very impressive, Mr. Kirk.
     (takes a puff on his cigarette)
     Before we ship you out and hand you over to wherever it is they take
     spies such as yourself, I wanted a word. Your little incursion into
     our training facility is going to leave an embarrassing mark on my
     record.

     O'NEILL
     Training facility?

     THORNBIRD

     (scornfully)
     You don't think we'd test fire a real missile twenty-eight floors
     inside a mountain, do you?

     O'NEILL
     Listen, you don't have the exact date...

     THORNBIRD
     What was the weapon you used?

   [He takes another puff on the cigarette.]

     O'NEILL

     (blinks)
     Weapon?

     THORNBIRD
     Our cameras saw some sort of weapon.

     O'NEILL
     Oh. Well, it's hard to say.

     THORNBIRD
     Some sort of state secret?

     O'NEILL
     No, just difficult to pronounce.

     THORNBIRD

     Hmmm.
     (takes another drag)
     Mister, my government doesn't take kindly to Soviet spies in its
     highest security facilities. Neither do I.

     O'NEILL
     Hmm. Bob...Can I call you Bob?

     THORNBIRD
     Even though you achieve nothing.

     O'NEILL
     Unless that's exactly what we were trying to achieve.

     THORNBIRD
     Kirk, you can talk to me, or you can talk to the CIA.

   [He takes another drag, certain he's got O'Neill there.]

     O'NEILL

     (pretending to be impressed)
     Ooh. All right. I'll be honest with you, Bob. My name's not Kirk.
     (pausing for effect)
     It's Skywalker. Luke Skywalker.

   [Thornbird simply stares at O'Neill and stubs his cigarette out in the
   ashtray.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--EVENING, PRESENT DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The room is empty except for Hammond, who is standing by the window,
   looking down at the inactive Stargate. A technician jogs up the stairs
   and enters the control room.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Still no sign of SG-1, sir. They never made it to P2X-555.

     HAMMOND
     Very well. SG-5 will have to complete their mission.

     TECHNICIAN
     If I may ask, sir...what are we going to do about SG-1?

     HAMMOND
     They're out there somewhere. Hopefully, they'll find their way back.

     TECHNICIAN

     (baffled)
     Shouldn't we start a search?

     HAMMOND
     I'm afraid this is one mission they're on their own.

     TECHNICIAN
     Yes, sir.

   [He turns and walks out, leaving Hammond standing by the window.]

   EXT--ROUTE 205 SOUTH, 1969

   [A blue van speeds past a brightly painted sign with a cowgirl lassoing
   the words: "BReathe Deeply Folks Soon Be In Albquerque." Beneath those
   words, in smaller print, is the message: "Visit Mike's Leather
   Emporium."]

   INT--BACK OF AN UNMARKED BLUE VAN

   [O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are sitting on benches along each
   side, handcuffed, facing each other.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen. I don't know where we're headed, but they'll probably try to
     split us up. So we're not going to have much time to...

     CARTER
     ...escape and hopefully live out the rest of our lives without
     affecting history.

     O'NEILL
     Or...

     CARTER
     I can't think of an 'or' at the moment, sir.

     DANIEL
     No 'or?'

     O'NEILL
     There's an 'or.'

     DANIEL
     There's an 'or?'

     CARTER
     Sir, you can't just will something to happen because you want it to
     be a certain way.

     O'NEILL

     Captain...where there's a will, there's an 'or.'
     (as Carter gives him a confused look)
     ...way.

     TEAL'C
     If I remain on this planet, I will eventually be taken over by my
     mature symbiote.

   [Hearing that, O'Neill raises his eyebrows. Something hits one of the
   rear tires of the van, causing the tire to blow. The van pulls off to
   the side of the road, and the three officers in the cab get out. One of
   them is the lieutenant who read Carter's note earlier. As the driver
   kneels down to inspect the tire, the lieutenant pulls his gun out of
   its holster.]

     LIEUTENANT

     (to the third officer)
     I'll keep an eye, you help the driver.

   [He gets into the back of the van with SG-1 and closes the door behind
   him. The driver and the other soldier attend to the flat tire. Cut to
   the interior of the van.]

     O'NEILL
     Flat tire?

     LIEUTENANT
     I'm the one who arranged it.

   [The members of SG-1 stare at him, surprised.]

     LIEUTENANT
     Before I can even think of doing what's asked of me in the note, I
     need to know who you are and who gave it to you.

   [Carter studies the lieutenant's uniform, and her eyes come to rest on
   his nameplate. It reads: "HAMMOND." Everything clicks for her at that
   moment.]

     CARTER

     (shocked)
     Oh, my God.
     (to Lt. Hammond)
     My name is Samantha Carter, and...you gave me the note, sir.

   [At that, Daniel, O'Neill and Lt. Hammond all give her puzzled looks.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Sir, before we left, General Hammond gave me a note and told me to
     keep it in my vest pocket until I got to the other side.

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     It's addressed to me. In my handwriting.

     O'NEILL
     What's it say?

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     'Help them.'
     (sarcastically)
     And seeing as helping you will undoubtedly lead to court-martial,
     I'd like to know why I would do that.

     CARTER
     Because it's your idea.

     O'NEILL

     (realizing)
     Albeit one you won't have for thirty years.

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (confused)
     What?

     CARTER
     I know this is kind of hard to understand, but...that's roughly how
     far back in time we've traveled.

   [The young Hammond looks at them skeptically, then turns to go.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     I'm sorry. I can't help you...

     DANIEL
     Wait, wait!

   [Hammond stops and turns]

     DANIEL
     We can...we can prove it.

     O'NEILL

     The date.
     (to Lt. Hammond)
     What's the date?

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     August 4th.
     (as Daniel and O'Neill stare at him)
     1969.

     O'NEILL

     '69...
     (to Daniel)
     What happened in '69?

     DANIEL

     The--the moon landing.
     (to Lt. Hammond)
     That was just a couple of weeks ago, right?

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     The entire world knows that.

     O'NEILL
     But not too many people know you watched it from your father's
     bedside in his hospital room...just two days after his first heart
     attack.

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (stunned)
     How did you know?

     O'NEILL
     Because we know you. We will know you. For some reason, thirty years
     ago, you decided we were going to need help. Otherwise, you wouldn't
     be standing there with a note. Now you going to listen to yourself,
     or not?

   [Hammond stands there for several seconds, then puts his gun back in
   its holster. He fishes keys from his pocket and bends down to unlock
   O'Neill's handcuffs.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     There are two other men, including the driver.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, thank you.

   [Hammond turns to unlock Carter's handcuffs. As he does so, his palm
   brushes against her injured hand.]

     CARTER
     Ow.

   [Looking down, Hammond sees the gash on her right hand. The skin isn't
   broken, but the cut doesn't look any better than it did before they
   went through the Gate.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     I'm sorry, miss. Did I hurt you?

     CARTER

     It's 'Captain.'
     (smiles)
     And it's all right...
     (noticing his rank)
     Lieutenant. Um, may I see the note?

   [Hammond takes the note out of his pocket and sits down beside Carter,
   handing it to her. O'Neill has freed Daniel and Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, we don't want to hurt anybody, but we are going to have to
     knock those guys out somehow.

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (holding up a zatnicatel)
     Will this do?

   [O'Neill takes the zatnicatel, glancing over it to make sure it's all
   right.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Lt. Hammond)
     All right, call for help.

   [Hammond hesitates, not understanding what they're up to.]

     TEAL'C
     The dangerous foreign agents you now guard have...inexplicably freed
     themselves.

   [Suddenly comprehending, Hammond nods, getting to his feet. He opens
   the back doors of the van and jumps out, drawing his gun and pretending
   to aim it at something inside that the other two officers can't see.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (shouting)
     Help!

   [Hearing the shout, one of the officers gets up and runs around to the
   back of the van--and O'Neill fires the zatnicatel at him. Blue
   electricity surrounds him, and he collapses to the asphalt. The third
   one is not far behind, but O'Neill leans around the side of the van and
   shoots him as well before he can even get around to the back. O'Neill
   closes the zatnicatel and jumps down to the asphalt. Hammond stares at
   the fallen men in amazement.]

     O'NEILL
     Where's the rest of our gear?

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (distracted, holstering gun)
     Uh, the Major ordered it shipped in a separate truck for security
     reasons. They should be right behind.

     O'NEILL
     All right, good. Get down on the ground. Go.

   [Hammond obeys, lying down beside the other two men. SG-1 retreats to
   the cover of the trees as a military truck comes around the bend.
   Seeing the van doors wide open and the three officers lying on the
   road, the driver pulls the truck over as well. The truck stops, and an
   officer gets out, running over to check the unconscious officers.
   Behind him, O'Neill carefully sneaks up to the passenger side of the
   truck. Unaware of his presence, the driver gets out of the cab as well,
   starting towards the men. O'Neill shoots the driver with the
   zatnicatel. The other soldier jumps up, reaching for his gun, but he
   isn't quick enough, and O'Neill shoots him as well. As O'Neill starts
   for the back of the truck, Hammond gets up and follows him. They open
   up the back, and O'Neill pushes back the tarp as he climbs in. He
   throws the tarp up on the top of the truck, and we see that the only
   contents are two locked metal boxes. O'Neill pulls one forward to
   examine it. As Hammond watches, O'Neill fires the zatnicatel at the
   box, breaking the lock. He kicks it a few times, then throws the lid
   open to reveal their confiscated gear. O'Neill pulls out the GDO,
   tossing it to Carter, and picks up another zatnicatel before closing
   the lid again.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Lt. Hammond)
     All right, everything you confiscated from us is in these two boxes?

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     Except for your ray gun, yes.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   [He gets up and grabs one end of the box, dragging it to the back of
   the truck to prop one end up on top of the other box there. Sitting
   down beside the boxes, he aims the zatnicatel.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the others)
     Watch yourself.

   [As they watch, he fires at the boxes once, twice, three times in
   succession. Blue energy crackles over the boxes before they
   disintegrate completely. O'Neill turns back to an astonished Hammond.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, your Major What's-His-Name had videotape of this thing in
     action.

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND
     Uh, yes. It was in those boxes along with everything else.

     O'NEILL

     Good.
     (jumps out of the truck)
     Got any cash?

   [He closes the zatnicatel.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (fumbling with bills)
     Uh, yeah, I might have some.

     O'NEILL
     That's good.

   [He snatches the cash from Hammond and pockets it.]

     O'NEILL
     I'll pay you back, with interest.

   [He turns and starts up towards the cab of the truck, with Carter and
   Hammond following behind him. Teal'c and Daniel bring up the rear.]

     CARTER

     (to Lt. Hammond)
     One more thing. You have to keep everything you've seen and
     everything we've told you a secret, and I mean for the rest of your
     life.

   [They come to a stop by the cab of the truck.]

     LIEUTENANT HAMMOND

     (understanding)
     'General Hammond.' I like the sound of that.
     (to O'Neill)
     What are you going to do now?

   [Holding it in front of his chest so that Hammond can't see it, O'Neill
   opens the zatnicatel again before turning around.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, you're better off not knowing. But I do want you to know that
     what I'm about to do keeps you from getting court-martialed.

   [With that, he shoots Hammond, who collapses, unconscious. O'Neill
   looks down with a bit of regret before looking back up at the rest of
   SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     We should get off this road. Find the interstate.

   [Closing the zatnicatel, he turns and starts off into the trees.
   Carter, Teal'c, and Daniel follow him out of the frame, with Carter
   glancing down at Hammond uncomfortably.]

   EXT--WOODED AREA

   [The camera pans down to show O'Neill leading Daniel, Carter, and
   Teal'c through the trees.]

     DANIEL
     So, what's the plan?

     O'NEILL
     Find the Stargate.

     DANIEL
     Find the Stargate? That's...that's the plan?

     O'NEILL
     Elegant in its simplicity, don't you think?

     DANIEL
     And if we don't find the Stargate?

     O'NEILL
     There's one in Antarctica.

     DANIEL
     There's one in Antarctica. That's...that's a fabulous plan.

     TEAL'C
     Assuming we locate the Stargate, how then do we get back to the
     future?

     O'NEILL
     Well, now, that's all in the note.

   [He stops, turning to face the team as they come to a halt.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Right?

     CARTER
     Uh, no, sir.

     O'NEILL
     'No, sir.'

     CARTER

     (pulling note out)
     Well, it...it doesn't explain how to get back, at least
     not...explicitly.

   [She hands O'Neill the note.]

     O'NEILL

     (reading)
     'Help them. August 10th, 9:15 A.M., August 11th, 6:03 P.M.' That's
     helpful.

   [He hands the note to Daniel, who reads over it.]

     CARTER
     Well, I suppose he had to be intentionally cryptic so as not to risk
     changing his own history.

     O'NEILL
     August 10th...that's cryptic.

     DANIEL
     Well, wait a second, it just means that on August 10th at 9:15 A.M.,
     something is going to happen.

     CARTER
     And happen again the next day at 6:03. We just have to figure out
     what that something is.

   [She looks over to Teal'c, who merely raises an eyebrow. O'Neill gives
   them a skeptical look.]

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   [He turns and resumes course, with SG-1 following.]

   EXT--ALONG AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY

   [The team comes up the hill and reaches the road. As O'Neill gets up to
   the road and starts to cross, a small red Corvette speeds by.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, the 'Vette blew it when they went with that body style.
     They used to be so cool.

     DANIEL
     Actually, I was about four and a half years old in '69.

   [They cross to the other side of the road, where there's a ditch that
   they can hide in, about six feet deep.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, stick your thumb out.

   [He turns and gets down in the ditch with Daniel and Teal'c. The three
   of them crouch down there while Carter stands by the road, sticking her
   thumb out.]

     DANIEL

     (as a car passes Carter by)
     We should go to New York.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     DANIEL
     Well, that's where Catherine used to live, or lives. She's probably
     the only person outside of the military who has the slightest idea
     where the Stargate might be. And I really don't think she's going to
     tell us over the phone.

     CARTER

     Daniel, you can't.
     (as he looks up)
     In order to preserve our past, Catherine has to meet you for the
     first time years from now.

     DANIEL
     So, we go in disguise. Pretend to be...foreigners.

     O'NEILL
     How are you going to do that?

     DANIEL
     Well, I speak 23 different languages. Pick one.

   [Teal'c watches as another car can be heard speeding right by Carter.]

     DANIEL
     Catherine said herself she began her research in the late sixties. I
     mean, who knows...maybe we're the ones who gave her the idea in the
     first place.

   [A white van passes Carter, not even slowing as it passes her by.
   Frustrated, Carter throws up her hands before sticking her thumb out
   again.]

     TEAL'C
     This method appears to be ineffective.

   [He gets up and climbs up to the road. Sensing imminent disaster,
   O'Neill gets up and climbs out of the ditch.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c? Teal'c!

   [A multicolored, brightly painted bus is coming down the road towards
   them as Teal'c steps directly into its path, holding his arms up, palms
   out towards the vehicle. It pulls to a stop barely a foot away from
   him, and we can see the peace-sign hood ornament as it stops. As Teal'c
   drops his arms, satisfied, O'Neill runs up and hits him in the
   shoulder.</blockquote>

     O'NEILL

     (frustrated)
     What are you thinking?

     TEAL'C

     (indicating the stopped bus)
     That is effective, O'Neill.

   [O'Neill gives him a look before going over to the side of the bus. Its
   doors swing open to reveal a long-haired, bearded young man at the
   wheel, with a smiling dark-haired girl in a poncho beside him. Both are
   clearly hippies to the extreme.]

     MICHAEL
     Hey. We would've stopped, man.

     O'NEILL
     Hi. Listen, we've got gas money. Where are you headed?

     MICHAEL
     Upstate New York, some big concert. Where're you headed?

     O'NEILL
     New York...back East.

     MICHAEL
     Hop in!

   [Smiling, the girl scoots back so that the aisle is clear. O'Neill
   steps onto the bus, inclining his head towards the others to indicate
   that they should follow. Carter gets on next, followed by Daniel, and
   finally Teal'c. The Jaffa hesitates at the foot of the steps.]

     MICHAEL

     (beckoning)
     Come on, ride up front with me, brother.
     (making a fist and holding it up)
     It's cool.

   [Teal'c looks a bit confused at this expression, but climbs on anyway.
   He takes the seat up front.]

     MICHAEL

     (raising hand)
     I'm Michael.

     TEAL'C
     I am not at liberty to reveal my identity.

     MICHAEL

     (nodding)
     Far out.

   [He reaches over and pulls a lever, and the bus doors swing shut.]

   INT--REAR OF HIPPIE BUS

   [Carter, O'Neill, the girl, and Daniel are sitting on benches along the
   sides of the bus, and the vehicle wobbles as it starts up. Cut to a
   shot of the back of the bus as it starts down the interstate.]

   [Inside the bus. Carter, O'Neill and Daniel sit there with the girl. No
   one says anything. The girl is smiling excitedly, almost dreamily at
   them, and O'Neill and Carter manage small smiles in response. Daniel is
   sitting next to her, and tentatively responds to the smile she's giving
   him.]

     DANIEL
     Hello.

     JENNY

     Hi.
     (after a moment)
     So what'd you do?

     DANIEL

     (glances at Jack)
     We didn't, uh, we didn't do anything.

   [She looks confused, her smile fading as she looks at the three of them
   again. O'Neill realizes that their uniforms provoked the question.]

     O'NEILL
     We've got a little problem with...the establishment.

     JENNY
     I so relate to that.

     CARTER
     So if you could take us as far as New York, we'd...

     JENNY
     I really love your hair.

     CARTER

     (taken aback)
     Thanks.

     O'NEILL

     (to Michael)
     Listen, we could really use some cheap clothes. So if you see a
     cheap clothes place around, we'd appreciate it.

   INT--CAB OF HIPPIE BUS

     MICHAEL

     (nods)
     No sweat.
     (to Teal'c)
     So, uh.. your thing...
     (makes a circular motion with hand, indicating Teal'c's tattoo)
     that thing, uh...what's it symbolize? Peace?

     TEAL'C
     Slavery. To false gods.

     MICHAEL
     Right on! So, um, it's made out of...

     TEAL'C
     Do not discuss it further.

     MICHAEL

     I dig. It's cool. So you just go AWOL?
     (as Teal'c finally turns to look at him)
     Hey, we're cool. After the concert, me and Jenny, we're even
     thinking of crossin' the border up to Canada.

     TEAL'C
     For what reason?

     MICHAEL
     You know, man...the war.

     TEAL'C
     The war with Canada.

   [At that, Michael turns and gives Teal'c a confused look, staring at
   him like he's from another planet.]

     MICHAEL
     No.

   [He turns back to watching the road, glancing nervously at Teal'c.]

   [A musical montage of scenes follows. Close-up on the front grill of
   the bus, then cut to a side shot of the bus passing a sign that
   indicates they're on Route 66 East. It's sunset, as the bus continues
   down the highway. Slow dissolve to a map of New Mexico and Texas, as
   the camera moves in closer. A red line moves across one of the routes
   on the map, tracking their progress, until it stops at Amarillo.]

   [On a sidewalk, day. Racks of clothing are out on the sidewalk outside
   a clothing store as Carter hands a woman some money. She's wearing a
   white shirt and an embroidered jacket over top of it, an ankle-length
   blue-and-yellow skirt and rose-colored sunglasses. She takes a bundle
   from the woman and turns to go as Jenny hands her a flower. Carter
   takes it with a smile and puts an arm around Jenny's shoulder as they
   turn to leave.]

   [The bus speeding down Route 66, passing some dairy farms. Dissolve
   briefly to the map; this time their progress takes them to St. Louis.]

   [The bus has pulled over to the side of the road. The hood has been
   popped open, and O'Neill, wearing jeans and a leather jacket, is
   tinkering with the engine as Teal'c--wearing a pink shirt, vest, and an
   Afro with a bandanna--walks around the bus to get a better look at what
   he's doing.]

   [The bus flies past another Route 66 East sign. We see that Teal'c is
   driving the bus, and Daniel is sitting up front beside him, helping him
   with the gear shift and looking a bit nervous. Past Daniel, we can see
   into the back of the bus, where O'Neill is sprawled out on one of the
   couches, fast asleep.]

   [The map, superimposed over a city skyline as the red line reaches
   Chicago. Cut to a store on a street corner as O'Neill, Teal'c, and
   Jenny emerge, with O'Neill carrying two paper bags of food and
   supplies, and climb onto the bus parked at the curb. Cut to the
   cab--this time Carter is driving and Teal'c is up front. Cut to one
   more shot of the bus crossing a city bridge as the map fades in,
   superimposed over the shot; the red line reaches Philadelphia. The
   background music ends.]

   EXT--THE WOODS, NIGHT

   [The bus is parked among the trees, presumably at a camp ground. Teal'c
   walks through the trees over to a small campfire, where Daniel, Carter,
   and O'Neill are already gathered. O'Neill helps himself to three metal
   cups of soup, handing one to Daniel as he sits down next to Carter. She
   takes the cup of soup O'Neill hands her, her attention solely fixed on
   the campfire as she stares into the flames. The campfire blazes
   normally, but the wind changes and something blows into the flame,
   causing the campfire to flare up briefly with a cascade of sparks
   before settling down again.]

     CARTER
     A flare.

   [Daniel looks up from his soup.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     That's the only explanation. We had to have been sent back because
     of a solar flare.

     TEAL'C
     Was there not an error in your calculations?

     CARTER
     I don't think so, Teal'c. But after the Abydos mission, when we
     couldn't figure out a way to make the Gate work again, I was asked
     to research alternative applications for the Gate. Including time
     travel.

     O'NEILL
     What'd you come up with?

     CARTER
     Well, just this..

   [She puts the soup aside and picks up a stick, drawing in the dirt as
   she explains.]

     CARTER
     What if a massive solar flare just happened to occur at the exact
     moment that we were traveling between Earth and another Stargate?

   [Michael and Jenny are standing over by the bus, talking. Overhearing
   part of what Carter's saying, the two hippies turn and look over at the
   campfire.]

     CARTER

     If the wormhole itself was redirected closer to the sun because of
     the Earth's magnetic field,
     (drawing a circle in the dirt)
     the increased gravity could slingshot us back to Earth.

     DANIEL
     Why haven't we tried this before?

     CARTER
     Because flares are impossible to predict. Light takes several
     minutes to travel between the Earth and the sun, so by the time a
     flare of sufficient magnitude has been confirmed, it's already too
     late.

     DANIEL
     Okay, if they're impossible to predict, how do we get ourselves
     home?

     CARTER
     August 10th, 9:15 A.M. It's in the note.

     O'NEILL
     The time and date of the next flare?

     CARTER
     Yeah. General Hammond must have used my own research to figure out
     what we needed.

     DANIEL
     Or maybe that's the reason he asked you to do the research in the
     first place.

   [Over his shoulder, we can just make out Michael's head passing between
   the trees.]

     CARTER
     And then he looked up two flares in August of 1969 that could send
     us home.

   [Having heard enough, Michael starts through the trees towards the
   fire, and Jenny follows.]

     O'NEILL

     (lifting his mug of soup)
     General Hammond, you old son of a...

   [He stops short as Jenny and Michael approach the campfire, staring at
   their strange companions.]

     O'NEILL

     Hello.
     (lifts his mug)
     Soup?

     MICHAEL
     Who are you guys?

     O'NEILL
     Come on. Have something to eat.

     MICHAEL
     I mean, traveling between the Earth and where? What's that about?

     CARTER
     When I said that, I was just imagining...

     MICHAEL
     Oh, I don't think so, man.

     JENNY
     You said...that you were in trouble with the establishment.

     O'NEILL
     And...we are.

     DANIEL
     We are.

     O'NEILL
     Just not the establishment of this planet.

   [Carter turns and stares at O'Neill. Michael and Jenny look confused.]

     O'NEILL
     No, it's true, Michael. We came to Earth to hide among your people,
     a long, long time ago.

     DANIEL

     (catching on)
     From a galaxy far, far away.

   [There is a pause as Michael and Jenny look at them, not convinced.]

     O'NEILL
     But now it's time to go home, and we need your help.

     JENNY
     How?

     DANIEL
     We need to be in a place called New York by tomorrow.

     MICHAEL
     I don't know, man.

   [O'Neill and Carter exchange looks, and Carter turns back to the fire;
   they've already taken the fib this far. O'Neill reaches down and picks
   up the zatnicatel beside him.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Michael and Jenny)
     It's all right.

   [He opens the zatnicatel and fires once into the campfire. As the
   energy from the blast hits the fire, the flames shoot up in a white-hot
   blaze before settling down again.]

     MICHAEL

     (amazed)
     Whoa! That was unreal!

     TEAL'C
     It is in fact extremely real. As is our need for assistance.

     JENNY
     We have to help them get home, Michael.

     MICHAEL
     Okay. We'll do it.

   [Daniel looks relieved. Teal'c is typically impassive. O'Neill closes
   the zatnicatel and smiles.]

   [The van is heading up the highway, then cut to a shot of the New
   Jersey Star, with a headline that reads: "Nixon to Vacation at the
   Summer White House" as a hand reaches in and pulls a copy of the paper
   out. Cut to the map, as the red line moves from Philadelphia up towards
   New York.]

   EXT--AN OBSERVATORY, DAY

   [The bus pulls up to the curb, and O'Neill and Teal'c hop out. Carter
   sticks her head out of the doors, calling to them.]

     CARTER
     Sir. Remember to use the hydrogen-alpha solar filter.

     O'NEILL
     Or I'll burn my eyes out...I know.

     CARTER
     Good luck.

   INT--OBSERVATORY

   [A massive telescope is set up on the platform. Teal'c and O'Neill
   enter to find that no one is there.]

     O'NEILL
     Yes!

   [He hops over the railing to get to the telescope, and Teal'c climbs
   over as well. O'Neill tucks his sunglasses into his jacket pocket,
   looking up at the telescope.]

     O'NEILL

     All right, we got one shot to prove Carter's theory.
     (to himself)
     Don't screw it up, Jack.

     TEAL'C
     Is not astronomy one of your hobbies, O'Neill?

     O'NEILL

     Not quite on this scale.
     (going over to the controls)
     Let's get that dome open.

   [He pushes a button, and the dome above them turns, opening to let the
   sun in. O'Neill puts his sunglasses on again as the dome locks, the
   telescope pointing right at the bright morning sun.]

   [Another shot of the bus driving down the highway. Cut to a shot of the
   Statue of Liberty, then dissolve to the map as the red line finally
   reaches New York City and then Jersey City.]

   EXT--SUBURBAN STREET, DAY

   [The bus pulls up to the curb in front of Catherine's home, a nice
   two-story house with a shaded porch and a long flight of steps leading
   up to the front door.<]

   INT--CATHERINE'S HOUSE

   [A much younger Catherine--in her mid-forties--shows Daniel and Carter
   into the living room. They're wearing the same outfits they picked up
   earlier, but Daniel has slicked back his hair.]

     CATHERINE
     Father never told me Andrek Gruber had a son.

     DANIEL

     (German accent)
     Vell, I vas but a small boy ven they vere shtill vorking together...

   [He and Carter sit down on the couch, and Catherine sits down in a
   chair across from them.]

     DANIEL
     ...but mein father often spoke of dein father as one of the few
     people in zis vorld he could trust.

     CATHERINE
     Before we continue, I must ask. What was so important it couldn't be
     discussed over the telephone?

   [Carter and Daniel exchange looks.]

     DANIEL
     Mein father believed zere must have been a zecond artifact near zat
     vich dein father discovered in 1928.

   [A maid enters carrying a tray with several cups of tea. As she sets it
   down on the coffee table, Catherine looks nervous.]

     CATHERINE

     Was weisst du davon?
     (Translation: What do you know of it?)

     DANIEL
     He referred to it in his notes as ze "Doorvay to Heaven."

   [Recognizing that answer as correct Catherine sits back, nervously
   glancing at the maid, who is still pouring tea. Out of frame,
   Catherine's cat meows insistently. Daniel gets the hint and switches to
   German.]

     DANIEL

     Wir haben ein Fragment der Steinplatte gefunden, mit einigen
     derselben Zeichnungen wie dieser, die vor allen diesen Jahren
     entdeckt wurde.
     (Translation: We have found a fragment of a coverstone with some of
     the markings as the one uncovered all those years ago, but there was
     nothing underneath it.)

   [The maid finishes up and leaves.]

     CATHERINE
     You found only a fragment? Nothing beneath?

     DANIEL

     (as Carter picks up a cup of tea)
     Ze artifact had already been removed.

     CATHERINE

     (frustrated)
     Oh...We always knew there had to be a second device with which to
     control the ring.

   [Carter sips her tea, and Catherine picks up a cup and saucer herself.
   There is an awkward moment of silence.]

     DANIEL
     I realize zese matters require ze utmost propriety, but..

     CATHERINE
     Did your father ever explain to you the nature of the work he was
     doing in 1945?

     DANIEL
     Only zat ze American militare vas under ze mistaken impression zat
     ze device dein father discovered might hold zome dark militare
     purpose. Uh, even zat much, I vas...svorn to secrecy.

     CATHERINE
     There was an accident.

     DANIEL
     Ernest Littlefeld.

     CATHERINE
     When the war ended, my father and I were told never to speak of it
     again. It is simply...locked away.

     DANIEL
     Undt...you cannot tell me vhere?

     CATHERINE
     Some old armory in Washington, D.C., gathering dust. But it's
     pointless. The military won't even acknowledge its existence.

   [Another pause. The cat meows again. Daniel picks up a spoon, stirring
   his tea before speaking.]

     DANIEL
     Vould you know...vhich armory?

   INT--OBSERVATORY

   [The telescope is all set up, and Teal'c and O'Neill are standing at
   the base of the telescope, waiting. O'Neill checks his watch before
   looking up again.]

     O'NEILL
     All right. In a few seconds, we'll know whether or not we can go
     back.

     TEAL'C
     And if we cannot, O'Neill?

     O'NEILL
     Guess we stay.

   [Unsure what to do about the implications of that, Teal'c looks down.]

     O'NEILL

     (checks watch)
     All right, it's showtime.

   [He puts his eye to the lens, squinting to make out the image. Cut to
   his POV through the telescope. Through the filter, we can clearly see
   the surface of the sun erupting in a solar flare. Cut back to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     (still looking into the telescope)
     Brother Teal'c, at precisely 6:03 P.M. tomorrow, we're goin' home.

   [Teal'c nods, smiling just a bit.]

   EXT--OBSERVATORY, DAY

   [O'Neill and Teal'c emerge just as the bus pulls up to the curb, its
   doors swinging open. The two men hop onto the bus and climb into the
   back, where Daniel and Carter are sitting.]

   INT--HIPPIE BUS

     CARTER
     Well?

     TEAL'C
     Your theory is confirmed.

     O'NEILL
     Where do we have to be for tomorrow's flare?

     DANIEL
     Washington, D.C.

   [The bus is on the highway again. Dissolve to the road map, as their
   route turns from New York, heading south towards Washington. Carter is
   driving, and Teal'c is up front beside her.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     We're almost there, sir. It's going to be close if we don't find a
     power source right away.

   [O'Neill puts on his cap.]

     O'NEILL
     We will.

   [He turns to Michael and Jenny, who are sitting in the rear of the bus
   with them.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen, I really have to say this. The two of you have been
     unbelievably...

     DANIEL
     Groovy.

     O'NEILL
     Groovy, I think, is the word.

     DANIEL
     Uh, the people of our world will be extremely grateful.

     O'NEILL
     Not the establishment, mind you.

     DANIEL

     (catching himself)
     No. Not...not them.

     O'NEILL
     I think what we're trying to say is that we have to go the rest of
     the way alone.

     JENNY
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     Because it's dangerous.

     MICHAEL

     (impulsively)
     We want you to take us with you.

     O'NEILL
     We can't do that.

     MICHAEL
     But you owe us.

     O'NEILL

     Yes, we do. We owe you a lot. But you belong here.
     (smiling)
     And you have to trust me on this. This is a great time.

     JENNY

     (interrupting)
     Michael got drafted.

   [Hearing that, O'Neill stops and stares at them. Daniel's smile
   abruptly fades.]

     MICHAEL
     We're just goin' to the concert first. You know, one last blast. But
     if we went with you...

   [He trails off. O'Neill sighs and looks away.]

     MICHAEL
     I don't wanna...kill anybody.

     O'NEILL

     (emphatically)
     Michael...

     CARTER

     Sir, you can't say anything.
     (as the others stare at her)
     He has to make up his own mind.

   [O'Neill looks down at the floor. Jenny looks disappointed.]

     CARTER
     We can walk the rest of the way from here.

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     We got to go.
     (puts on his sunglasses)
     I'm sorry.

   EXT--ARMORY

   [As the bus pulls up to the armory, O'Neill, Teal'c, Daniel, and Carter
   climb out. Jenny follows, stopping Carter to talk to her.]

     JENNY
     Your secret's safe with us.

     CARTER

     (hugs her)
     We know that. Thank you.
     (releases her)
     Take care.

   [Carter follows the rest of the team as Michael steps out of the bus
   and puts an arm around Jenny. She turns and hugs him tightly, and he
   wraps his arms around her as well.]

   INT--ARMORY

   [In the center of the warehouse is a tall, almost flat rectangular
   crate standing up on its end--obviously containing the Stargate. A
   guard crosses the floor of the armory, walking out of frame past a
   Jeep. A second later, there is a crackle and a blast of blue-white
   tendrils of light appears from out of frame in the direction the guard
   came. A second later, O'Neill walks out into the floor, closing the
   zatnicatel in his hand. He runs towards the Gate, signaling to someone
   out of frame, and the other three members of SG-1 follow him.]

   [O'Neill climbs up on one side of the crate holding the Stargate, with
   Daniel behind him, and Carter and Teal'c go to the other side. Carter
   and O'Neill open the locks at the base of the crate, while Teal'c and
   Daniel climb up the sides, opening the locks higher up. Carter takes
   her position down by some crates as Daniel reaches the topmost lock on
   his side. Teal'c hesitates until O'Neill signals to him, then reaches
   over and unlocks the final lock.]

   [The front and back of the crate fall down to reveal the Stargate,
   leaving the top and sides of the crate standing like a picture
   framearound the Gate. Carter stands up as Teal'c and Daniel climb back
   down, following O'Neill around to the front of the Gate.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Where to?

     CARTER
     Back the way we came, via P2X-555.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute, how do you know we'll go forward in time instead of
     back?

     CARTER

     Well, General Hammond must have chosen flares on the opposite side
     of the sun this time, so the Sun's rotational differential will send
     us forward instead of back.
     (seeing their doubtful expressions)
     Look, we just have to trust General Hammond. I mean, the point is,
     we are fifteen minutes away from the only chance we are going to get
     at this, and we still haven't found a power source to fre...

     O'NEILL

     (irritated)
     How much power?

   [A couple of cables are hooked up to the chevron on the lower left side
   of the Stargate, which is glowing red. Power is humming through the
   cables, and the camera follows the cables over some crates to the
   source--the engine of one of the military vehicles in the armory.
   O'Neill is sitting behind the wheel, revving the engine.]

   [Carter sits in the cab of another vehicle hooked up to the Gate, and
   Daniel and Teal'c are beside the Stargate, having turned it by hand and
   keeping an eye on the connection. Two of the chevrons are lit up, and a
   third one locks.]

     CARTER

     (shouting over the engines)
     Keep it going!

   [Outside the building, a guard is passing by, but stops when he hears
   the sound of the chevrons locking. Curious, he approaches a side door.]

   [Inside, six out of seven chevrons are locked, and only the final
   chevron at the top of the Gate hasn't locked yet. As the hum of the
   engines and the Gate increases in pitch, Teal'c and Daniel jump down,
   getting clear before the wormhole activates. At that moment, the guard
   comes in a side door. Seeing the Gate running, he dashes forward,
   pulling his gun out of its holster.]

   [The final chevron locks, and the wormhole activates in a blue-white
   plume of energy. Shocked, the guard hesitates, taken aback by the
   sight. The four members of SG-1 move to the base of the 'ramp' formed
   by one of the sides of the crate. The guard remembers himself and pulls
   out his gun.]

     GUARD

     (shouting)
     You! Stop!

   [The team turns to see him pointing the gun at them. Another guard
   comes in through a door that leads out into a railing along the upper
   wall.]

     O'NEILL
     We have got to go.

   [Above them, the other guard draws his gun as well. O'Neill rushes
   forward towards the crates, opening the zatnicatel and firing at the
   guard above them as the team dives behind a bunch of crates for cover.
   Seeing the other guard fall--and just what kind of weapon O'Neill's
   packing--the first guard takes cover behind a Jeep as well, firing at
   the team. O'Neill fires back, zapping the Jeep with energy. Dazed, the
   first guard falls backwards.]

     CARTER
     Sir, the timing has to be exact. Just a few more seconds.

     O'NEILL
     It's going to have to be close enough. Go!

   [The guard up top recovers and gets up, and the first guard gets back
   behind the Jeep. Carter gets up and makes a break for the Gate,
   followed by Daniel and Teal'c. The guard up top takes a few shots at
   them, and O'Neill shoots at him a few times, electrifying the railing
   and causing the guard to falter as O'Neill gets up and runs for the
   Gate, diving through the wormhole as the guards continue to shoot.]

   [Traveler's-eye view of transit through the wormhole, then to the
   Stargate on the other side. With a yell, O'Neill dives through the
   wormhole and hits the deck, covering his head as a few bullets come
   through, harmlessly ricocheting off metal.]

   [The wormhole shuts off, and the members of SG-1 get up, looking
   around. It's the Gate room of Stargate Command, but aside from the four
   of them, it's completely empty and abandoned, and the lights are
   dimmed. The pieces of equipment aside from the Stargate are all wrapped
   up. It looks as though no one has used the place in years.]

   INT--GATE ROOM

     O'NEILL

     (getting up)
     Auntie Em? Auntie Em?

     CARTER
     Where is everyone?

   [The bay doors slide open then, and an elderly woman in a white dress
   steps into the Gate room.]

     CASSANDRA

     (smiles)
     Hello, Jack.

   [Startled, Jack turns to stare at her. The woman walks up to the base
   of the ramp, looking at them with amazement and delight.]

     CASSANDRA

     Teal'c? Daniel?
     (laughs)
     I hardly recognized you with hair.

   [Carter looks at Daniel and Teal'c, both of whom look completely
   puzzled. O'Neill steps forward cautiously.]

     O'NEILL

     (clearing throat)
     Do...do we know you?

     CASSANDRA

     Sam will recognize me.
     (to Carter)
     Come closer.

   [They slowly walk down to the base of the ramp, with Carter in the
   lead. As she reaches the woman, Carter suddenly smiles brightly, her
   eyes lighting up with recognition.]

     CARTER

     Oh my God.
     (hugs her)
     Cassandra!

     CASSANDRA

     (laughing)
     Dear Sam.

     O'NEILL

     Excuse me.
     (taps Carter on the shoulder)
     Who is this?

     CARTER

     (stepping back from her)
     Cassandra.

     O'NEILL
     Cassie's thirteen years old.

     CASSANDRA

     Not anymore, Jack.
     (as O'Neill suddenly understands)
     I've been expecting you...my whole life, in fact. You entered the
     Stargate a few seconds too soon, so the flare threw you far into the
     future. I've come to send you back where you belong.

     DANIEL
     How did you know we'd come here?

     CASSANDRA
     When I was old enough to understand, Sam explained what happened,
     and that I'd be the one to send you home.

     CARTER
     Like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

     CASSANDRA

     (nods)
     Mm-hmm. As much as I would love to spend more time with you, the
     timing must be precise. You have to go.

     CARTER
     Already? But there's so much that you...

     CASSANDRA
     You of all people know I can't.

   [Carter nods, understanding. Cassandra lifts her hand, and we can see
   some kind of device on the back of her hand, with what looks like a
   single green stone in the center. She traces a finger around the stone,
   and it lights up with a green glow. The wormhole activates again--this
   time there's no plume, and the chevrons don't spin. The wormhole simply
   fills in the center of the ring. Carter takes the GDO out of her bag,
   keying in the activation code.]

     CASSANDRA
     I will tell you this...your journey's just beginning.

   [They stop and look at her for a moment, and Carter puts the GDO back
   before SG-1 turns and walks up the ramp through the wormhole.]

   INT--GATE ROOM, PRESENT DAY

   [The Gate has already activated, and the camera cuts to the control
   room.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Incoming traveler, sir.

   [Hammond and another technician hurry into the control room, and
   Hammond goes to the window.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (surprised)
     It's SG-1.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [He turns and runs out of the control room. Cut to the Stargate as the
   iris slides open. The bay door slides open and Hammond walks in, just
   as SG-1 steps through the wormhole. Seeing that they're finally home,
   O'Neill throws up his hands in relief, pointing both fingers at
   Hammond.]

     O'NEILL
     Yes!

   [He heads down to meet Hammond at the base of the ramp, with the rest
   of the team behind him.]

     O'NEILL

     (snapping off a half-salute to Hammond)
     We're home...

   [Behind them, the wormhole shuts off.]

     O'NEILL
     ...thanks to one sparky young Lieutenant Hammond.

     CARTER
     How did you know, sir?

     HAMMOND
     When I was a young lieutenant, I was ordered to escort four people
     out of Cheyenne Mountain. In the vest pocket of one I found a note
     with my name on it. Needless to say, I followed its instructions.

     CARTER
     But you couldn't have known when to give it to me.

     HAMMOND
     No, not until I saw the cut on your hand. Remember when I took your
     cuffs off.

     CARTER
     Then you've been waiting for this to happen.

     HAMMOND
     Ever since we met. I almost didn't let you go.

     CARTER
     But if you didn't, you would have changed your own history.

   [O'Neill simply smiles and shakes his head.]

     HAMMOND
     It's going to be a long debriefing, people. We'll start in one hour.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Oh, by the way, Colonel...with interest, you owe me five hundred
     thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents.

   [Carter and Daniel can't help but grin at that one.]

     O'NEILL

     (smiles)
     Yes, sir.

   FADE OUT
