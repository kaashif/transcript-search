   EXT--A PLANET, DAY

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac are walking amid a smouldering scene of
   destruction, with many dead Jaffa strewn amidst boulders and metal
   crates.]

     TEAL'C
     These warriors are of both Ramius and Tilgath.

     BRA'TAC
     This meeting did not go well.

     TEAL'C
     Some of these warriors have been shot in the back. They were killed
     while retreating.

     BRA'TAC
     There was no honor in this battle.

   [They come to a Goa'uld dressed in golden armor. Bra'tac bends down to
   examine and touch three huge holes in his abdomen, which show blood
   through the armor. He is dead.]

     BRA'TAC
     Tilgath.

   [Bra'tac stands.]

     TEAL'C
     Ramius must have betrayed their allegiance.

     BRA'TAC

     (looking off camera to his right)
     The First Prime of Ramius.

   [The First Prime is sitting up against a crate. He is bloody and is
   just opening his eyes. Bra'tac bends to grab his shoulder.]

     BRA'TAC
     He is alive.

     FIRST PRIME
     You must go from this place.

     BRA'TAC
     Why did your master betray Tilgath? Speak!

     FIRST PRIME
     We came to forge an alliance. My master did not do this. He barely
     escaped alive.

     TEAL'C
     Then what happened here?

     FIRST PRIME
     One warrior. You must--ahh!

   [He is hit by an energy weapon fired from his left. Teal'c and Bra'tac
   turn and begin to fire their staff weapons. We see a single alien
   soldier clad all in black, partially in hard armor and partially in
   black cloth. Its head is complete covered with a helmet. The staff
   weapons have no effect on it. It raises its left arm as if to fire.
   Teal'c and Bra'tac drop their weapons and dive for cover as the soldier
   begins firing a barrage of energy pulses at them. The soldier begins to
   advance on them, walking slowly. Bra'tac tries to attack it
   hand-to-hand with his staff weapon but the soldier easily disarms him
   and throws him to the ground. The soldier begins to advance on Teal'c's
   position behind cover, firing. Teal'c fires his zat repeatedly at the
   soldier, at first to no effect, but then the soldier begins to waver,
   finally falling to the ground, all movement stopped. Teal'c stands, and
   he and Bra'tac exchange a look of gratitude and confused amazement.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A team of four SGC personnel come through the wormhole. They are
   carrying the alien soldier tied down to a stretcher. Teal'c and Bra'tac
   come through right behind the team. Daniel, Carter, and Hammond are
   waiting at the bottom of the ramp and watch as the stretcher is loaded
   onto a gurney.]

     HAMMOND
     What the hell happened out there?

     TEAL'C
     Our intelligence was correct. The summit between Ramius and Tilgath
     did indeed take place. However when we had arrived, Ramius had
     already fled.

     BRA'TAC
     All those who remained had been slain, including Tilgath.

     HAMMOND
     By this one man alone?

     BRA'TAC
     From the way he fought us, I do not doubt it.

     HAMMOND
     An Ashrak?

     TEAL'C
     He was unlike any warrior we have previously encountered.

     DANIEL
     Obviously, you were able to take him down?

     TEAL'C
     He withstood the brunt of our weapons fire before finally
     succumbing.

     CARTER
     Its armor must protect it from energy-based weapons. If that's the
     case, we could be dealing with an entirely new kind of technology.

     DANIEL
     And we believe this wasn't a set-up by Ramius to kill Tilgath?

     BRA'TAC
     Ramius' Jaffa were equally as decimated. His First Prime said his
     master barely escaped alive.

     DANIEL
     So, obviously, someone found out about the alliance and wanted to
     stop it.

     HAMMOND
     Major, run whatever tests you have to.

     CARTER
     I'd like to call the Tok'ra in on this one, sir, with your
     permission.

     HAMMOND
     Do it. I want to know everything we can about this warrior.

   INT--SGC LAB

   [Cater and Jacob are at the controls of an MRI scanner. The warrior's
   armored body is being slid into the scanner head first. The computer
   screens show nothing but static and interference.]

     CARTER
     The suit must be affecting the MRI.

     JACOB
     As long as he's wearing that armor, we're not going to learn
     anything more.

   [Some time has passed. Carter is in surgical scrubs. She and Jacob are
   examining the helmet, trying to remove it.]

     CARTER
     His helmet is made up of two pieces. Pass me those forceps.

   [Jacob gives her the forceps. She uses them and a retractor to open the
   helmet. There is a hissing sound, and some fluid sprays out of the
   seam. They pull on a gel-like substance and pull off the front of the
   helmet, revealing the creature's face, which is white and translucent.
   There is a piece of black equipment still over its nose and mouth. Its
   eyes are open and a very pale gray.]

     CARTER
     Looks like he's fused right into the suit.

     JACOB
     Some sort of breathing filtration system.

   [Carter pulls off the breathing unit to reveal the warrior's whole
   face, which looks hardly more solid than gelatin. Carter and Jacob
   exchange worried looks.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Jacob is standing in front of an X-ray of the warrior's head and neck;
   a Goa'uld symbiote is seen along its spinal column.]

     CARTER
     It's a Goa'uld. Quite frankly, that's not as shocking as the host.

     HAMMOND
     How so?

     CARTER
     It has an incredibly unusual organ structure.

     JACOB
     Everything's out of proportion. Physiologically, the heart and lungs
     had to be abnormally large to supply enough blood and oxygen to its
     muscles. Basically, it's like someone tried to genetically engineer
     the perfect athlete without any concern for longevity.

     TEAL'C
     Leaving it to the symbiote to sustain its life.

     DANIELN
     An engineered host.

     JACOB
     A seriously flawed one. Even a Goa'uld symbiote wouldn't be able to
     compensate for long. We're still in the process of analyzing genetic
     data. But for now we can tell you, there was no evident trauma from
     energy weapons.

     HAMMOND
     What does that mean?

     CARTER
     The warrior's armor appears to possess some sort of advanced energy
     absorption technology. If it works the way I think it does, it
     wouldn't matter how many staff or zat blasts were fired at it.
     Nothing would get through.

     HAMMOND
     Are you suggesting that Teal'c and Bra'tac didn't kill this Goa'uld?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. Apparently, the host was on the verge of a pulmonary
     failure long before it encountered them.

     HAMMOND
     It had a heart attack?

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     Sorry, Teal'c. You didn't stop it. You and Bra'tac just got lucky.

   INT--SGC LABORATORY

   [The warrior is lying on a metal exam table. It is clad in black cloth
   from head to foot, leaving only its face uncovered. Jacob, Daniel, and
   Carter are on one side of the table.]

     JACOB
     Its entire cellular structure is less then three weeks old. It is
     organic, but it was definitely created in a lab.

     CARTER
     Well, we know the Goa'uld have been trying to physically perfect a
     host that would be superior to humans.

     JACOB
     Well this thing's definitely a lot stronger than humans, but it's
     far from superior.

     DANIEL
     Traditionally. the Goa'uld are also somewhat vain about their
     appearance.

     JACOB
     This was obviously intended to be a new form of foot soldier.
     Possibly a reaction to the recent uprising of the Jaffa. What's most
     interesting is that this being was not alive when it was first
     grown. It was given life after it reached its mature state.

     DANIEL
     Frankenstein's monster.

     CARTER

     (to Jacob)
     How do you know that?

   [Selmak takes control of Jacob's voice.]

     SELMAK
     Remnants of a unique energy signature within its cells. It's similar
     to the residual effects left by the use of a sarcophagus.

     DANIEL
     Could it give life to something that wasn't alive in the first
     place?

     SELMAK
     No. A sarcophagus is designed to boost health and longevity, heal or
     revive someone terminally injured. They are nowhere near powerful
     enough to animate non-living cellular matter.

     CARTER
     Then what could have?

     SELMAK
     Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a device originally created
     by the Ancients. He determined its primary purpose was to heal. But
     it was so powerful, its effects on human hosts ultimately proved
     devastating. However, after much research and experimentation, the
     Goa'uld was able to use the technology to create the first
     sarcophagus.

     DANIEL
     Obviously he wasn't able to eliminate all of its negative side
     effects.

     SELMAK
     The Tok'ra have long sought this device in the hope of using it to
     perfect the sarcophagus technology, so that we could all benefit
     from it. Now, it may be the key to fighting this new warrior.

     CARTER
     How?

     SELMAK
     With the device, we may be able to devise a weapon to counteract
     this life-giving energy.

     DANIEL
     Who was the first Goa'uld to find the device?

     SELMAK
     His name was Telchak.

     DANIEL
     Telchak.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel enters, followed by Jacob and Carter.]

     DANIEL

     (searching for and finding a book on his shelves as he speaks)
     Nicholas Ballard, my, uh, grandfather... One of Nick's early
     obsessions was finding the so-called "Fountain of Youth". He claimed
     he'd found evidence indicating the source of the fountain's power
     was a piece of alien technology used by early Mayan tribes around
     900 B.C. Nick traced its origins to Chac, the Mayan god of rain.

     JACOB
     And you think this Chac may have actually been Telchak?

     DANIEL
     Just a hunch.

     CARTER
     Maybe not just a hunch. The primary function of the device was to
     heal, right?

     JACOB
     For the Ancients. For humans to see any positive effect, it would be
     from very limited exposure at a safe distance.

     CARTER
     Still, if the device was kept hidden near a water source, it could
     be the basis of the Fountain of Youth mythology.

     DANIEL
     Nick believed Chac's temple was located somewhere in Central
     America. He spent decades of his life searching for it but came up
     empty. I've been over his notes and most of it's indecipherable. The
     only mention of the temple's location is somewhere near a waterfall
     and a river.

   [Daniel hands the thick, old notebook to Jacob. Writing and hand-drawn
   illustrations can be seen on the pages.]

     JACOB
     This is written in an obscure dialect of Goa'uld.

   [Daniel appears suprised to hear this, as is Carter.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Daniel, Carter, and Jacob are there with Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     So where is it?

     DANIEL
     It's here. If Selmak's right, Telchak's temple is in southern
     Honduras.

     HAMMOND
     How can we be certain the device is there?

     DANIEL
     Uh, we can't but, um...

     CARTER
     We think we know who's responsible for creating the Goa'uld warrior.

     HAMMOND
     Telchak?

     DANIEL
     No.

     SELMAK
     After Telchak created the sarcophagus, Anubis went to war with him
     for possession of the original Ancient device.

     DANIEL
     And that was long ago, before Anubis attempted to ascend.

     SELMAK
     Anubis defeated Telchak, but he never did find the device. It was
     believed to be hidden in one of Telchak's many temples.

     HAMMOND
     You think Anubis is behind this?

     CARTER
     He knew about the technology. While he never actually found the
     device, he ultimately wouldn't need to.

     DANIEL
     He would have gained access to the knowledge when he ascended. He
     could've built himself a new one.

     HAMMOND
     Still it's only a guess.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     SELMAK

     (at the same time as Daniel)
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     But, it's a good one.

     CARTER
     The good news is, sir, the original Ancient device is probably still
     here on Earth.

     SELMAK
     If we could analyze the technology of this device, it might be
     possible to engineer a weapon we can use against these warriors.

     CARTER
     Not to mention the possibility of harnessing its power to heal.

     HAMMOND
     Very well. Doctor Jackson, take Doctor Lee and see what you can
     find. Dismissed.

   EXT--TWENTY MILES OUTSIDE OF TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS, DAY

   [Daniel and Doctor Lee arrive in a small village wearing civilian
   clothes and carrying backpacks laden with camping gear, etc.]

     LEE
     Are you sure this is the right place?

     DANIEL
     This is where he said he'd be.

     LEE
     What if he doesn't show up?

     DANIEL
     Well, we have a few beers, make a few friends.

   [They take off their backpacks and sit at a table outside the cantina.
   A man approaches carrying a tray.]

     ROGELIO

     Hola, muy buenos días, caballeros. Quieres una cerveza o una tequila
     o algo?
     Translation: Hello, very good day to you, gentlemen. Do you want a
     beer or a tequila or something else?

     DANIEL

     Um, de hecho, estamos buscando a un guía llamado Rogelio, el quedó
     de vernos aquí.
     Translation: In fact, we're looking for a guide named Rogelio, who
     was to meet us here.

     ROGELIO

     (calling to someone inside the cantina)
     Pedro, haste cargo, tió!
     Translation: Pedro, take over, Uncle!

     ROGELIO

     (sitting down opposite Daniel)
     I am Rogelio, Rogelio Duran, at your service. This is just my day
     job.
     (indicating Daniel)
     You must be Doctor Jackson.

   [They shake hands. Daniel is eating pistachios.]

     DANIEL
     That's right. Uh, this is Doctor Lee.

   [Rogelio and Lee shake hands.]

     LEE
     Buenos Días.

     ROGELIO
     Encantado. So, you guys want to see some temples?

     DANIEL
     Actually, we want to see one temple in particular.

   [Daniel pulls out a map from his backpack.]

     DANIEL

     (pointing at a spot on the map)
     Here.

     ROGELIO
     I'm sorry to tell you this, Señor, but there are no temples there.
     What you want to do is go north. That's where all the good stuff is.
     There's lots of ruins. My cousin has a truck. We could be there in
     five hours.

     DANIEL

     (pointing to the map again, insistent)
     Yeah, I'm sure the North is great, but we really want to go here.

     ROGELIO
     Señor, I've been to this part of the country many times. There is
     nothing there, I promise you. North--that's where you want to go.
     Trust me.

   [As he speaks, Rafael is visible in the background, being attended to
   by two women but watching Daniel and the others with interest.]

     DANIEL
     Look, either you take us south or we'll find someone who will.

     ROGELIO
     Oh, okay, okay, okay...it's your money.

     DANIEL
     So you say your cousin has a truck.

     ROGELIO
     Simón. His house is just around the corner. Of course there is the
     issue of filling the tank with gas.

   [Daniel nods to Lee. Lee pulls out a bundle of cash. He puts a few
   bills on the table. Rogelio looks disappointed; Lee shakes his head in
   disgust but adds more. Rogelio smiles.]

     ROGELIO
     Okay! Now we're talking business. Let's go, gentlemen.

   [Rogelio smiles broadly and stands, waving at them to follow.]

     LEE

     (getting up slowly)
     Uh, look, I need a receipt or something. I gotta fill in the
     paper...

   [Rafael is sitting alone, watching them leave.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bra'tac, Carter, Hammond, and Tea'c are standing near the window that
   overlooks the Gate room.]

     BRA'TAC
     If Anubis is truly behind this, then his strategy is to assassinate
     any minor Goa'ulds vulnerable to attack, absorbing their troops and
     resources, in preparation for battle with Ba'al and the System
     Lords.

     HAMMOND
     How many more of these so called minor Goa'ulds have suffered
     attacks?

     BRA'TAC
     At least three. These new warriors are devastating.

     HAMMOND
     Do we have any idea where they're coming from?

     BRA'TAC
     No.

     HAMMOND
     Our fear is it's only a matter of time before Anubis targets Earth.

     BRA'TAC
     These beings are a great threat to all who hope to one day see the
     Goa'uld wither in defeat.

     HAMMOND
     If Doctor Jackson can recover this Ancient device--

     BRA'TAC
     Even if he does, there is no guarantee the Tok'ra can devise a
     weapon capable of fending off these warriors.

     CARTER
     We were only able to learn a limited amount from our study of the
     dead warrior and its armor.

     TEAL'C
     The only way to learn more is through interrogation.

     CARTER
     Which means we have to capture one alive.

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Hammond enters as Carter is examining the warrior's armor; it is
   dressed onto a mannequin.]

     HAMMOND
     What have we got, Major?

     CARTER
     The warrior's armor is able to resist our strongest armor-piercing
     weapons, as well as absorb energy weapon fire. However, we've
     discovered that the material is made up of a close-knit fiber that's
     very similar to Kevlar. Meaning, something small and sharp should be
     able to penetrate, such as a fine-tipped Trinium dart.

   [She shows him a dart, loads it into a dart gun, and fires the gun at
   the mannequin. It penetrats the cloth-like portion of the armor.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter and O'Neill are walking through the corridor as they talk.]

     CARTER
     According to Bra'tac, the fact that this Ramius is still alive makes
     him a likely target. Now, there are enough rebel Jaffa under his
     command that gaining access to the planet shouldn't be a problem.
     The plan is to stake out the Stargate on Ramius' planet and capture
     one of the warriors when it comes through.

   [They walk up to an elevator, O'Neill swipes his card through, and they
   begin to wait.]

     O'NEILL
     What if one doesn't come through?

     CARTER
     Well, we come home, I suppose. However, let's say Bra'tac is right.
     We meet his contacts on Ramius' planet and set up an ambush using a
     Tok'ra forcefield to trap the warrior, and then hit it with
     tranquilizers.

     O'NEILL
     How does the dart get through the shield?

     CARTER
     They're one way. They keep things in, not out.

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

   [The elevator arrives, and they both enter it.]

     CARTER
     So what do you think?

     O'NEILL
     I have some notes.

   [The elevator doors close.]

   INT--SOUTHERN HONDURAS, DAY

   [Daniel, Lee, and Rogelio are hiking on a path alongside a large group
   of waterfalls. Lee is first in the single-file line.]

     LEE

     (looking at a paper map)
     According to the map, we're in the right place but, uh...

     DANIEL

     (looking at a GPS locator)
     This makes no sense. The legend of the Fountain of Youth says that
     all nearby water flows towards it.

   [They have entered a sort of clearing, covered with plants but without
   trees.]

     LEE
     Well, how's that possible?

     DANIEL
     Well, maybe the device has special properties or maybe its just
     superstition or maybe it means the water flow from that waterfall
     back there flows in the direction of the temple.

     LEE
     Well it should be right here, but, uh...

     ROGELIO
     Nobody ever listens to me, man. I tell them there are no temples out
     here but what do they do? They come out here anyways. Now the
     North...the North has roads. We could drive to any temple we want,
     but instead we're out here walking through this jungle.

     DANIEL

     (ignoring Rogelio's complaints)
     Yeah, okay. Um, let's spread out, look for a... temple. In lieu of
     that, look for a totem or marker of some kind. Anything that might
     tell us where to go from here.

   [Lee and Rogelio stand there staring at Daniel, looking like they are
   about to refuse to go further.]

     DANIEL

     (quietly commanding)
     Go.

   [Rogelio moves off. Lee takes one step and falls into the ground.
   Daniel hears him and turns.]

     LEE

     (from below the ground, with an echo)
     Found it!

   EXT--RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

   [There is a pyramid ship at the top of a rise, and a huge moon in the
   sky. Cargo ships and death gliders fly overhead. SGC combat personnel
   including SG-3 are in a dry riverbed taking up defensive positions.
   Behind them the remainder of SG-1 with Bra'tac are walking down the
   riverbed with some rebel Jaffa.]

     ADAL

     (to Bra'tac)
     I believe this is the best spot to set up for your ambush. This path
     leads directly to the pyramid of Ramius. I will go now to ensure
     that your eventual escape will be undetected.

     BRA'TAC

     (grasping his arm)
     Brother.

     ADAL
     Tek ma te, Master Bra'tac. It is an honor to be in your service.

     BRA'TAC
     Many thanks, Adal. Chal nak.

   [Adal leaves.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, Carter, do your thing. Reynolds, I want flanking
     positions set up on either side of the clearing.

     REYNOLDS
     Roger that.

     O'NEILL
     Ring the perimeter with C4 and Claymores.

     REYNOLDS
     Not much faith in Plan "A"?

     O'NEILL
     Since when has Plan "A" ever worked?

     REYNOLDS

     (smiling)
     Right.

   [He leaves to follow O'Neill's orders.]

   INT--MAYAN TEMPLE RUIN, DAY

   [Daniel drops down through a short stone-paved shaft to join Lee inside
   the entryway to the buried ruin that he'd fallen into.]

     DANIEL
     You okay?

     LEE
     Yeah, I'm fine. At least you were right about there being something
     here.

   [Daniel looks up to Rogelio, who is leaning over the opening of the
   shaft from above.]

     DANIEL
     Listen we're gonna go uh&ehllip; look around. Stay put.

   [Lee shows Rogelio his radio, and Rogelio does the same.]

     ROGELIO
     You got it, Señor. Have fun.

   [Lee and Daniel shine their flashlights down a narrow stone-walled
   passage and begin to go through it.]

     DANIEL
     It's definitely early Mayan stonework.

     LEE
     Oh, yeah.

   EXT--RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1, SGC combat personnel, and the rebel Jaffa are behind cover
   around the sandy clearing, weapons ready.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     SG-3 Sierra, this is SG-1 Niner. What's your status?

     SG-3 MEMBER

     (over radio)
     We're maintaining position. Stargate is secure. There's no activity.

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Maybe we should start a pool.

   INT--MAYAN TEMPLE PASSAGEWAY

   [Daniel and Lee are proceeding through the passageway.]

     LEE
     Uh, is this cramped thing getting to you? I-I mean, why would they
     make these passageways so narrow?

     DANIEL
     Maybe they were skinny people.

     LEE
     Uh, and the roof, too. Ow, my head! God!

     DANIEL
     Skinny, short people.

   [The passageway opens in to a larger chamber whose walls are completely
   lined with square stones, aged but otherwise unmarked.]

     LEE
     It's a dead end.

     DANIEL
     There's no other passageway. Nothing on the walls or ceiling. No
     glyphs, no seals, no ancient script. Not even a pictograph.

     LEE
     Isn't there always writing?

   [Daniel ponders Lee's question and then turns and shines his flashlight
   right into Lee's face.]

     LEE
     You know, I mean, somewhere, there's bound to be. Maybe not.

   EXT--RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

     SG-3 MEMBER

     (heard on radio)
     SG-1 Niner, this is SG-3 Sierra. Target has just come through the
     gate and is en route to your position.

     O'NEILL

     (to people around him)
     All right, heads up.

   [Everyone prepares their weapons. The black-clad warrior comes jogging
   slowly down the path and into the clearing. Carter is holding an alien
   device, ready to activate it.]

     O'NEILL
     Do it!

   [Carter presses the device and a rectangular-sided shield erects around
   the warrior in a distorted yellow color. The warrior stops. O'Neill
   fires two Trinium tranquilizer darts into the warrior, hitting it in
   the leg and abdomen. The warrior pulls the darts out and throws them to
   the ground. It does not appear at all affected by the tranquilizer.]

     O'NEILL

     (worried)
     Carter?

     CARTER
     I don't understand, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Hit him again?

     CARTER
     Third dart could kill him. We want him alive.

   [The warrior easily exits the shield and moves toward their position.]

     O'NEILL
     Son of a bitch!

   [O'Neill abandons the dart gun and takes over a high-powered machine
   gun held by a member of SG-12 positioned right next to him. Everyone
   opens fire on the warrior with all weapons they have. The weapons have
   no effect as the warrior's armor deflects them. The warrior takes out
   three rebel Jaffa then turns and hits Reynolds in the left arm with the
   energy blast. Seeing that nothing is working, everyone stops firing.
   O'Neill grabs an explosives detonator.]

     O'NEILL
     Fire in the hole!

   [O'Neill squeezes the detonator and Claymore explosives are set off
   right under the warrior. It emerges from the smoke and debris
   unscathed.]

     O'NEILL
     C4!

   [Carter sets off the C4 via remote, causing a huge, fiery explosion.
   The warrior walks through it with no damage. The warrior continues
   right past Bra'tac as a concerned Teal'c looks on. Suddenly the sound
   of ships is heard overhead.]

     CARTER
     Sir, our position's been made.

     O'NEILL

     (to the people near him)
     All right, grab the wounded and saddle up.
     (into radio, voice activated)
     SG-3 sierra, dial the gate. We're aborting the mission.

     SG-3 MEMBER

     (over radio)
     Negative, SG-1. We have major unfriendly Jaffa closing in on our
     position. We cannot hold the gate. Repeat, Stargate is not secure!

     BRA'TAC
     Soon we will be surrounded. If we fight, many more will die.

     O'NEILL
     What do you want to do?

     BRA'TAC
     Surrender. There is a chance Adal and his rebel Jaffa can free us
     later.

   [O'Neill looks very displeased with that option, glancing toward the
   ships flying overhead and then very seriously back at Bra'tac.]

     Doctor Jackson? Doctor Lee?

   INT--CHAMBER IN MAYAN TEMPLE

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Yeah, we're here. We, uh, found a chamber. We're gonna be a while.

     ROGELIO

     (voice via radio)
     Ah, take your time, Señor.

     DANIEL

     (to Lee)
     Well, we're paying him by the hour.

     LEE
     I don't understand. How are we supposed to find this thing if there
     is no writing?

     DANIEL
     All water flows towards it.

     LEE
     So?

     DANIEL
     Give me your canteen.

   [Lee takes his canteen from his shoulder and gives it to Daniel. Daniel
   holds out his flashlight.]

     DANIEL
     Here, hold this.

   [Daniel starts pouring water onto the floor. It begins to travel along
   the grout between the stone tiles.]

     LEE
     What good's that gonna do?

   [Daniel keeps pouring. The water travels along the grout but then falls
   into the floor when the grout turns into an empty crack between the
   tiles. Daniel gets down onto his knees as puts his head sideways on the
   tile with the crack around it, listening for something. He hears the
   plopping of water dropping.]

     DANIEL
     There's something under here.

     LEE
     You're good.

   EXT--RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

   [Death gliders are flying overhead.]

   INT--RAMIUS' PYRAMID SHIP

   [O'Neill, Bra'tac, the rebel Jaffa and all of the SGC personnel are
   inside a jail cell, trapped behind clear horizontal bars that cross the
   window in the door into the cell. The cell is further guarded by
   several of Ramius' Jaffa standing just outside it. Inside the cell,
   Carter is tending to Reynolds' energy weapon wound by holding a bit of
   his torn tee-shirt over it.]

     O'NEILL
     How's he doing?

     CARTER
     He's stable for now, but we've got to get him out of here soon.

     REYNOLDS

     (breathing heavily from the pain)
     I'm fine.

     RAMIUS

     (off-screen)
     Jaffa!

   [Ramius arrives and looks challengingly at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter and others)
     I'll handle this.
     (to Ramius, all in a campy fashion)
     Greetings! Well, uh, I know how this looks. So, I think it's
     important we clear up any misunderstanding right away. We did not
     come to kill you. Honest.
     (to his cellmates)
     Am I right!?

   [They all nod but not with a lot of enthusiasm. He gives them a
   scolding look.]

     O'NEILL
     The fact is, and this is the fun part, we actually came to save your
     ass...es. All your asses. Do you see the irony?

   [Ramius gives him a scowl.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, there's this guy out there, big guy, big guy in a black
     suit. None too fond of you Goa'ulds. Well, anyway, he's the one
     we're after, not you. So if you want to let us go, we'll be on our
     way, to save the world another day--you're not buying this, are you?

     RAMIUS
     Jaffa! Kree!

   [Ramius gives a disgusted look and leaves.]

     CARTER
     Uh, that went well.

     O'NEILL
     That went well.

   INT--CHAMBER IN MAYAN TEMPLE

   [Daniel and Lee are using wooden wedges and crow bars to lift the large
   cover stone from the area that the water flowed towards. It is very
   thick and heavy, but they manage to tip it up onto its side. They look
   down inside the now-revealed small alcove to see a cube-shaped artifact
   with pyramid-shaped indentations on the sides and writing along the
   edges.]

     LEE
     Well, at least it has writing on it.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     LEE
     What's it say?

     DANIEL
     I have no idea.

     LEE
     Oh.

   [Lee reaches in to take the artifact. Daniel grabs his arm to stop
   him.]

     DANIEL
     Careful! Uhm, it's the root technology of a sarcophagus which, by
     itself, causes madness and addiction. This is supposedly something
     far more powerful. So accidentally activating it could be bad.

     LEE
     Okay.

     DANIEL
     Let's just try picking it up without touching it too much.

   [Together they lift the artifact gently out of the alcove. As soon as
   they have it, the stone they had levered up onto its side falls back
   into place. There is a rumbling sound and the whole chamber begins to
   vibrate heavily. They look around the chamber and at each other. There
   is a sound of rushing water.]

     DANIEL
     I think running would be a good idea right about now.

   [A sheet of water suddenly comes pouring over them from the top of a
   wall. Jets of water come in from all sides, exploding into the chamber
   and breaking the walls apart.]

   EXT--ENTRANCE TO TEMPLE, DAY

   [Rogelio is looking down into the entrance shaft. He hears something.]

     ROGELIO

     (into radio, worried)
     Doctor Jackson, can you hear me?

   INT--JAIL CELL, RAMIUS' PYRAMID SHIP

   [Carter is looking over Reynolds, with Bra'tac at her side. He stands.]

     BRA'TAC
     Your friend's condition worsens.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well, your friends can show up any time now.

     BRA'TAC
     We must consider that they may not.

     O'NEILL

     (turning toward him, surprised.)
     Really?

     BRA'TAC

     (nodding)
     At least we are alive.

     O'NEILL
     Yes...if you call this living.

     CARTER
     You're worried that the super soldier will kill Ramius and then just
     slaughter the rest of us.

     O'NEILL
     Super Soldier?

     CARTER
     No?

     O'NEILL
     It has a ring.

     TEAL'C
     Most likely the warrior was only after Ramius. When we attacked, its
     only concern was escape so that the mission may be completed.

     O'NEILL
     So what? We just sit around while Ramius gets whacked? Then what?

   [O'Neill turns to the Jaffa guarding the cell.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey. Hey, what, a little conversation gonna kill ya? Look, I know
     you're all about loyalty. Well, so am I. In fact many's the time--

     JAFFA GUARD
     Silence!

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c walks up to the Jaffa and speaks to him through the window.]

     TEAL'C
     Hear me, Jaffa. Your master is a false god and will surely be
     defeated. However, you still have a chance to be free.

     JAFFA GUARD
     Your words mean nothing to me. I know who you are--the Shol'va
     Teal'c, and Bra'tac; O'Neill of the Tau'ri. Assassins who believed
     they could slay my master.

   [They all hear the sounds of staff weapons and other weapons fire and
   explosions outside.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, if we're assassins, who's that? Hmm?

   EXT--ENTRANCE TO MAYAN TEMPLE, DAY

   [Rogelio sees that the entrance shaft is nearly full of swirling, muddy
   water. The ground around him is still quaking.]

     ROGELIO

     (into radio)
     Doctor Jackson, Doctor Lee, can you hear me?
     (shouting directly into entrance shaft)
     Can you hear me?!

   [He watches the water as the quaking subsides. There are bubbles but no
   sign of Daniel or Lee. He closes his eyes in sadness. Then the artifact
   bursts out of the water, followed by Daniel, who is holding it. Rogelio
   takes it and helps pull Daniel out of the shaft. Lee is right behind
   him and climbs out himself.]

     ROGELIO
     Are you okay? I thought you were dead for sure. What happened,
     Señor?

     DANIEL
     We triggered some sort of trap.

     LEE
     I think I figured out why those passageways were so narrow. It's to
     prevent people from escaping alive.

     DANIEL
     You're good.

     ROGELIO

     (holding the artifact)
     What have you found?

   [Daniel gets a shocked look on his face, and holds his hands up. Lee is
   surprised too, and they both slowly stand, facing Rogelio but with
   their arms raised in surrender.]

     ROGELIO
     Oh, I'm not going to rob you, Señor.

   [Daniel and Lee gesture for Rogelio to turn and look behind him. He
   turns and sees Rafael and three other men, all wearing rebel-like
   fatigues and holding guns on them.]

     ROGELIO

     Usted? Madre de dios.
     Translation: You? Mother of God.

   INT--JAIL CELL IN RAMIUS' PYRAMID SHIP

     O'NEILL
     Consider this: does it sound like it's going well?

     TEAL'C
     Your master will be slain, as will you if you do not free us.

     JAFFA GUARD
     You lie. My master is a god. He is invincible.

   [There are shouts from multiple Jaffa, coming nearer. They sound
   distressed. The guards outside the cell leave, except for the Jaffa
   they have been speaking to.]

     O'NEILL
     You're next, you know.

     TEAL'C
     Ramius will force you to die for him while he attempts to escape.

     JAFFA GUARD
     My god will fight for his people.

     BRA'TAC
     You are wrong, my friend. Your god is somewhere cowering in fear
     like a child. I have seen it before. He will not hesitate to
     sacrifice all your lives to save his own.

   [The guard looks at them and then leaves, leaving them locked in the
   cell.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting after him)
     Hey! What about us?!

   [O'Neill turns to Teal'c and Bra'tac.]

     O'NEILL
     Shouldn't it be getting easier to convince these guys?

     CARTER

     (with a distressed Reynolds)
     Sir?

   [Reynolds is shaking and having trouble breathing. He turns to look at
   O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Hang in there, Reynolds.

     REYNOLDS
     As long as it takes.

   [The Jaffa guard comes back and touches a device on his wrist. The door
   to the cell swings open.]

     JAFFA GUARD

     (entering the cell and giving O'Neill a zat)
     Ramius has fallen. Go now, before it comes for you.

   [O'Neill gives the zat to Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Go, go, go! Come on, guys! Go on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

   [Reynolds is helped to stand by several people. Everyone rushes out of
   the cell. The Jaffa guard is left and O'Neill looks at him carefully,
   then raises his eyebrows.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on.

   [The Jaffa guard follows O'Neill out.]

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [Daniel, Lee, and Rogelio are walking in a line, blindfolded with their
   hands bound and resting on the person in front of them, as the rebels
   lead them on a path through the jungle. Daniel and Lee have lost their
   outer shirts and so are wearing white tee-shirts.]

     DANIEL
     Listen, if this is some sort of turf thing we're not aware of, uh,
     we're sorry.

     ROGELIO
     Oh, no Señor, por favor, please, don't speak.

     DANIEL
     No, I'm just saying that-that whoever you guys think we are, we're
     not.

     RAFAEL
     Who do I think you are?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. We're, uh, we're scientists, archaeologists as a
     matter of fact. I'm just saying that if, you know, this is a
     kidnapping, which I'm assuming it is, that you should know that
     we're not worth anything.

     RAFAEL
     Trust me, gringo, everyone's worth something to somebody.

   [Lee stumbles and falls to the ground.]

     LEE
     I tripped. I'm sorry. Gee, I can't see anything.

   [In a panic, Rogelio takes off his blindfold and starts running for the
   woods, his hands tied.]

     RAFAEL

     (indicating Rogelio)
     Chalo!

   [Chalo runs a few steps then aims and fires an old automatic rifle at
   Rogelio, hitting him once. Rogelio falls near a tree. Hearing the shot,
   Daniel kneels down and raises his arms defensively.]

     DANIEL
     What just happened?

     RAFAEL

     Your guide, he tried to run. What can you do? Maybe now we'll all
     stay on the path, eh muchachos?
     (shoving Daniel)
     After you. Vámonos.

   INT--RAMIUS' PYRAMID SHIP

   [SG-1 and the others enter a large room of the ship and find many dead
   Jaffa. They find Ramius dead as well, killed by multiple energy blasts
   and lying in the middle of a ring transport platform.]

     O'NEILL
     Ouch!

     TEAL'C
     It would appear Ramius was attempting to get to one of his ships.

     CARTER
     Sir, I think we still have a chance to capture the warrior.

     O'NEILL
     How?

   EXT--DRY RIVERBED ON RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

   [The super soldier is running back along the path it arrived on. A
   cargo ship flies toward it and hovers just above it. Its rings
   activate, coming down to the soldier.]

   INT--GOA'ULD CARGO SHIP

   [Teal'c is at the controls of the ship while Carter stands next to the
   closed door of the cargo transport area.]

     CARTER

     (to Teal'c)
     Transport cycle complete.

     O'NEILL

     (vai radio)
     Carter? Did you get him?

   [There are loud bangs from within the cargo area.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Got him.

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Good.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [The camp is in a clearing in the jungle. A rebel is cooking on a
   campfire. There are wooden sheds and an old helicopter in the
   background and various crates and equipment spread around. Rafael and
   his rebels arrive with Daniel and Lee.]

     CHALO

     (whistles)
     Chino! Jose! Ven par aca!
     Translation: Come here!"

   [Other rebels come into the clearing at the command.]

     RAFAEL

     Far enough. Agarralo. Llevenselo.
     Translation: Grab it. Take him.

   [The rebels remove Lee and Daniel's blindfolds but not the plastic
   bindings on their hands. They walk them over and throw them roughly
   into a small shack, where they sit up against the back wall. Both have
   long since lost their glasses and Daniel squints in the sunlight that
   comes through between the boards of the shack.]

     DANIEL
     Look I don't know what you expect, but no one's gonna pay anything
     for us. We're not worth anything.

     RAFAEL
     That is unfortunate for you, because if no one pays, you both die.

   [The rebels close the door on the shack. Daniel and Lee exchange
   looks.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Hammond have just exited the elevator and are walking.]

     HAMMOND
     It's still unconscious?

     CARTER
     Not surprising, considering we voided the cargo bay of life support
     as soon as we got it on board the ship. It took ten minutes for it
     to pass out.

     HAMMOND
     I'm surprised it's even still alive.

     CARTER
     It put up a hell of a fight, sir.

   [They enter Hammond's office as the phone is ringing.]

     HAMMOND

     (into phone)
     Hammond... Very well.
     (hanging up and turning to Carter)
     Your prisoner is awake.

   INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM AND LAB

   [The super soldier is wearing only the cloth armor and is fastened to
   the wall by metal bands around its limbs and neck. It is awake and
   moving its head and moaning. Jacob, Carter, and Hammond watch from the
   observation room. Bra'tac and Teal'c are in the room with the soldier.]

     BRA'TAC

     (approaching the soldier)
     Who do you serve? Hmm? Speak!

     SUPER SOLDIER
     I serve Anubis.

   [It makes strange sounds as Bra'tac walks away and Teal'c approaches.]

     TEAL'C
     How were you created?

   [It makes more strange sounds but says nothing. Bra'tac turns to those
   in the observation room and shakes his head.]

     HAMMOND

     (nodding)
     I think it's safe to assume they're not going to get anything more
     out of him. Have you found anything else?

     CARTER
     Our initial scans indicate below normal brainwave patterns emanating
     from both the symbiote and the host. Basically, he's got all the
     strength and healing powers of a normal Goa'uld, but none of the
     normal personality traits.

     JACOB
     The Goa'uld use sophisticated brainwashing techniques.

     HAMMOND
     I'm open to suggestions. How can we find out what it knows, if
     anything?

     JACOB
     There is one possibility. We may be able to use a memory recall
     device to access any conscious images in its mind as it thinks them.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill is walking down the corridor in search of Hammond, and spots
   him.]

     O'NEILL
     Sir? Any word from Daniel?

     HAMMOND
     No. Doctor Jackson is now six hours overdue per his regular contact
     schedule.

     O'NEILL

     (concerned)
     That's late, even for Daniel.

     HAMMOND
     The Honduran government has assured the State Department they're
     looking into it. They've sent some people to their last reported
     location. So far, they've found nothing.

   INT--SGC LAB

   [Jacob is inside with several devices. Teal'c, Carter, Hammond, and
   Bra'tac are watching.]

     JACOB
     If his brainwaves are compatible with the device, we should be able
     to see whatever he's thinking holographically.

   [Jacob places a memory recall device on the soldier's temple. Teal'c
   approaches it.]

     TEAL'C
     What is your planet of origin?

   [Jacob activates the holographic device. It shows a star field.]

     JACOB
     That's the sky above his planet.

     CARTER
     I don't recognize any of these star configurations. This could be
     anywhere.

     JACOB
     We have star mapping technology that should be able to pinpoint this
     location in the galaxy. He just gave us his home world.

   [Jacob and Teal'c smile in triumph.]

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [Rafael comes out of the large shack, stretching as if he's been
   sleeping.]

     RAFAEL

     Listos!
     Translation: Get ready!

   [Some rebels open the door to the shack holding Daniel and Lee and
   place a cup with a little bit of water in it on a straw mat just inside
   the door. They also place a hand-made wooden stool inside. Rafael
   approaches and stands at the door looking in.]

     RAFAEL
     I know it's not much, but we do what we can.

   [Rafael takes a knife from one of the rebels and enters the shack. He
   cuts the plastic straps off of Daniel and Lee's wrists then backs up to
   sit on the stool.]

     RAFAEL
     So, here's my proposal for you. I will ask questions, you give me
     answers. I believe you, you get more water, food, maybe even a
     blanket at night, okay? Okay. Who do you work for?

     DANIEL
     I told you, we're archaeologists. We're--

     RAFAEL
     Maybe I was not so clear. If I don't believe you, things get worse
     for you... much worse.

     DANIEL
     You kill us, you get nothing.

     RAFAEL
     Maybe I kill one of you to get your government's attention. Who
     lives... who dies... that's up to you, my friend.

     DANIEL

     (squinting)
     Okay, you, uh, you listen to me. What you're doing now is a big
     mistake. You see people, very powerful people, are going to come for
     us and uh... well, let's just say by letting us go now, you're going
     to save yourself a lot of trouble.

     RAFAEL

     (pretending to consider at first)
     Okay. We do it the hard way.

   [He gets up and starts to leave, then turns around to face them,
   gesturing with the knife.]

     RAFAEL
     Understand this: I will not hesitate to kill you both. Make an
     example of you for your government so the next time, they will take
     us seriously. You should know, many prisoners talk as you do, "my
     friends will come and save me." It gives them hope.

   [A computer screen shows a star map and patterns being drawn through
   it, zeroing in on a star system and showing the gate address.]

     CARTER
     The Tok'ra call it Tartarus. It's a seemingly unoccupied planet on
     the edge of Goa'uld controlled space.

     JACOB
     The Tok'ra are currently trying to get as close as they can to
     assess any defenses that might be there.

   [Hammond enters from his office to face Jacob, Carter, O'Neill, Teal'c
   and Bra'tac.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     I'm afraid I have some bad news. I just received a communiqué from
     the State Department in Washington. It appears that Daniel Jackson
     and Doctor Lee have been kidnapped. Our best guess is they've
     crossed the border into Nicaragua. However, as of this moment, we
     have no idea where they are.

   [O'Neill looks very concerned and shares a concerned glance with
   Carter.]
