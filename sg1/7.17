   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Through the window to the Gate Room, a video camera records some
   workers, one on a ladder, performing maintenance on the Stargate.]

     BREGMAN
     So are you getting the full thing?

     JAMES
     Just about, yeah.

     BREGMAN
     Well, instead of zooming out, why don't you pull back a little? Get
     it in context, right?

     JAMES
     Okay.

     BREGMAN
     Yeah, just keep going back.

   [The camera moves back to get a wider footage as Bregman pulls James
   back slightly from the window. James is holding a steady-cam video
   camera.]

     JAMES
     Okay, okay. Yeah, that's good.

     BREGMAN
     Yeah, it's amazing.

   [Rundell approaches them from Hammond's office.]

     RUNDELL
     Yes, it is.

   [The documentary crew is startled and turns to Rundell. Wickenhouse
   holds a large boom microphone.]

     RUNDELL
     Mister Bregman?

     BREGMAN
     Yeah?

   [Rundell offers his hand and Bregman shakes it.]

     RUNDELL
     Colonel Tom Rundell, Cheyenne Mountain Complex Public Affairs
     Liaison.

     BREGMAN

     (chuckling)
     That's quite a mouthful. Call me Emmett.

     RUNDELL
     Yes, sir.

     BREGMAN

     (cautiously)
     Okay. This is my posse here.

     JAMES
     Tech Sergeant Dale James.

     BREGMAN
     On camera.

     WICKENHOUSE
     Airman First Class Shep Wickenhouse, sir.

     BREGMAN

     (talking simultaneously)
     Shep on sound.

     RUNDELL
     Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir. But what are you doing here?

     BREGMAN

     (confused)
     We're getting some establishing shots. The first of many, I hope,
     while we're waiting. In fact, we should get a shot-a shot of you,
     Colonel.

   [He nudges James to film Rundell. Rundell puts up his hand in denial.]

     RUNDELL
     I'm sorry. But, you're not authorized to begin until you've been
     briefed by General Hammond.

     BREGMAN
     I've already been briefed Tom, is it? by the Defense Department.
     What's the problem? I'm cleared to shoot here. Maybe-maybe you guys
     haven't been cleared. Have you been cleared?

   [He smiles at James and Wickenhouse who weakly smile in return.]

     BREGMAN
     Sorry, what is the problem here?

     RUNDELL
     General Hammond's ready to see you now.

     BREGMAN

     (warily)
     Okay.

   [Rundell leads Bregman to Hammond's office. James and Wickenhouse
   remain where they are.]

     WICKENHOUSE

     (sarcastically sighing)
     This should be fun.

     JAMES

     (rolling his eyes)
     Oh yeah.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is seated at his desk when Rundell and Bregman enter.]

     RUNDELL
     General Hammond, sir? This is Mister Bregman.

   [Rundell places a folder on Hammond's desk in front of the General.]

     BREGMAN

     (with wide grin)
     I'm very excited to be here, sir.

   [Bregman holds out his hand for Hammond to shake. Hammond ignores it
   and opens the file folder.]

     HAMMOND
     You may find that we're not all quite as giddy as you are about this
     project, Mr. Bregman.

     BREGMAN
     "Giddy"? Uh...I, well, I'm personally and professionally, uh,
     excited, I think I said "excited" to be here, General. I haven't
     been giddy since well, you don't want to know about that.

     HAMMOND
     No.

     BREGMAN
     No.

     HAMMOND
     I just want to be as clear as I can up front.

     BREGMAN
     Sure.

     HAMMOND
     Your presence is highly unorthodox, and I will not let it threaten
     the security of any ongoing missions or the safety of my people.

     BREGMAN

     (jocularly)
     Well, I've already been frisked three times. We can make it a fourth
     time. You can do it personally, get to know each other a little
     better, General, if you want...
     (noticing Hammond is not amused)
     I'm sorry.

     HAMMOND
     I consider it my responsibility to protect my people's interests.

     BREGMAN
     I understand that.

     HAMMOND

     (continuing)
     And quite frankly, I feel it's appropriate to warn you that no one
     around here wants to be part of your little reality show.

     BREGMAN
     Oh, I see. You know, General, I think you're probably well aware
     that there were film cameras on the beaches of Normandy decades
     before "Survivor" debuted on CBS. And, personally, I think it's an
     outrageous oversight that the Stargate Program hasn't been
     chronicled up to this point.

     HAMMOND
     That's because it's top secret. Only a handful of people will see
     anything you shoot.

     BREGMAN
     So far, General, so far. Eventually, inevitably, this program is
     going to be disclosed to the American people and to the whole world,
     and I'd like to think that this little film that we're doing here
     might in some small way provide insight into what's really been
     going on here for the last six years.

     HAMMOND
     What's really been going on?

     BREGMAN

     (chuckling without humor)
     You know what, General? I respect what you're doing here. I can even
     respect that you want me out of here. But the President of the
     United States invited me to do this.

     HAMMOND
     You see that red phone? You wouldn't be here if he hadn't.

     BREGMAN
     Well, then, I hope I can expect the full cooperation of you and your
     personnel.

     HAMMOND
     To the letter of these orders.

     BREGMAN
     To the letter. I see. I see. Thank you.

     HAMMOND
     You have high expectations to meet.

   [Bregman pauses, then leaves, his expression grim.]

     RUNDELL

     (standing to attention)
     General.

   [Rundell leaves. Hammond sighs as he reviews the orders again.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Personnel transport a cart down the corridor. On it is an alien sphere
   hooked with some wires. Bregman and Rundell talk in the hallway.]

     RUNDELL
     Maybe it's my opinion, but it seems to me throughout history...

     BREGMAN

     (noticing the alien device)
     What's that?

     RUNDELL

     (continuing, completely ignoring the device)
     ...the best documentaries have taken a, you know, cinema verité
     approach...

     BREGMAN

     (muttering)
     Yeah, yeah cinema verité...

     RUNDELL

     (continuing)
     ...letting the subject tell its own story.

   [Bregman pulls out a notepad folder from his briefcase and opens it.]

     BREGMAN
     Yeah, tell you what, Tom? I think that that's probably a very
     interesting point of view, and, uh, mostly, if not totally, crap,
     especially in a situation like this. You know, if this story was
     going to tell itself, you know what? Then there'd be Stargate
     updates on the nightly news! You do have a point, you have a point
     in the sense that we probably should start with a soft approach and
     make people feel comfortable, gain their trust. You know what? We
     would be here a year! These soldiers conceal things for a living.

     RUNDELL
     Airmen, sir. We're the United States Air Force.

     BREGMAN

     These "airmen" conceal things for a living. And the only way that
     I'm going to get anything out of these people is not by the--
     (distracted by another device being transported down the hall)
     Look at that. That's
     (refocusing)
     by the...the...what'd you say? The "cinema verité" approach. It's
     going to be by the-by the "wringing it out of them" approach. That's
     the only way I'm going to--

     RUNDELL
     Look, Mister Bregman, as far as I'm concerned, you are here strictly
     to document what is going on...

     BREGMAN
     I know.

     RUNDELL

     (continuing)
     ...not to pursue anything that might be prejudicial to Air Force
     personnel.

     BREGMAN

     (chuckling)
     Why don't you call me Emmett? Okay?

     RUNDELL
     If someone were to offer something up in an interview...

   [O'Neill walks down the corridor. Bregman spots him.]

     BREGMAN
     Is that who I think it is?

     RUNDELL

     (glancing over)
     It's Colonel Jack O'Neill.

   [Bregman moves towards O'Neill. O'Neill continues to walk by quickly
   heading to the open elevator.]

     BREGMAN
     Colonel O'Neill. Hi. I'm--

     O'NEILL

     (not breaking stride)
     I like vanilla over chocolate. My favorite color is peridot. I think
     Tibet should be free. And if I could have dinner with anyone in the
     world, it'd be Mary Steenburgen.

   [Bregman chases O'Neill to the elevator, coming up short as he
   processes O'Neill's last comment.]

     BREGMAN
     No-no, I'm just trying...Mary Steenburgen?

     O'NEILL
     I think she's nice.

   [The elevator doors start to close, and Bregman forces himself into the
   entryway to keep the doors open.]

     BREGMAN
     No, No! Look, I'm just trying to get a minute...

   [O'Neill represses the elevator door button and leans forward as
   Bregman stabilizes himself in the door frame.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, I really don't have time at the moment.

     BREGMAN
     Can you...No, no, I'm--

     O'NEILL
     I've got a briefing to go to.

     BREGMAN
     I understand, I'm Emmett--

   [Bregman offers his hand. O'Neill coughs into his right hand, then
   moves to shake Bregman's hand, who pulls his own hand back, laughing
   good-naturedly. He stumbles slightly as the doors start to close on him
   again, but he pushes them back.]

     BREGMAN
     Now look, I'm not going to be able to get a perspective on this
     whole Stargate Program without you, Colonel. So when is a good time
     for you?

     O'NEILL
     Any time's good. Just, uh, send me a memo.

   [O'Neill shoves Bregman back slightly, and the doors close.]

     BREGMAN

     (chuckling falsely)
     Memo.

     RUNDELL

     (dryly)
     I really sensed he's starting to trust you.

   [Bregman raises his finger, about to respond, but Rundell walks away.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Wickenhouse wires Carter with a microphone. Carter appears
   uncomfortable and nervous.]

     BREGMAN

     (indicating Wickenhouse to Carter)
     Don't worry about it. He only looks unprofessional.
     (Carter smiles weakly)
     You know, Major, General Hammond warned me that people might be a
     little less than enthusiastic about all this.

     CARTER
     Yeah, we did have a bad experience with a TV crew last year.

   [Airmen adjust lights and the camera equipment. Carter starts as
   Wickenhouse attaches the microphone pack to her belt.]

     BREGMAN
     The Prometheus incident. I know that the Air Force insisted on their
     own crew for that reason.

     CARTER
     I think you might also be sensing reluctance from people around here
     to put themselves up on a pedestal. I mean, we are just doing our
     jobs.

   [She gives a cautious look to Wickenhouse, who is still adjusting the
   microphone on her.]

     BREGMAN
     Just a job? Well, I consider it my job to put you up on a pedestal,
     'cause this job looks to me to be nothing short of extraordinary.
     And from what I read of your file, the same can be said about you
     personally.

     CARTER

     (blushing)
     See, now I'm blushing.

     BREGMAN
     So you are. Then we should start. It'll look good on camera. All
     right, let's go, guys.

   [Bregman moves to his seat off-camera.]

     BREGMAN
     Are you ready?

     CARTER

     (sitting and clearing her throat)
     No.

   [James moves towards Carter with a light meter, checking readings.]

     BREGMAN
     What are you doing? We don't need a light meter, the woman is
     glowing. Let's get rolling.

   [James moves back behind the camera.]

     JAMES
     We're rolling.

   [Carter straightens on her stool.]

     BREGMAN
     Sound?

     WICKENHOUSE
     Rolling.

     BREGMAN
     Okay. Major Samantha Carter. U.S. Air Force. Astrophysicist.
     Considered the foremost expert on the Stargate. You've explored
     territory that no one on Earth, in the history of Earth has ever
     seen, and you've fought an enemy that no one on Earth has even
     imagined.

   [Carter squirms uncomfortably at the praise and nods.]

     BREGMAN
     Major Samantha Carter, meet the six and a half billion people of the
     planet Earth.

   [Carter looks at the camera and gulps nervously.]

     CARTER

     (shyly)
     Hi.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 21

   [Rundell, Wickenhouse and James are already set up down the corridor.
   The documentary camera records Bregman and Daniel coming into view,
   walking down the hallway together.]

     BREGMAN
     I don't think I've asked the following question before in my entire
     career. But, what was it like to be...well, dead?

     DANIEL

     (bristling)
     I wasn't exactly dead.

     BREGMAN
     Oh, you were--what was the word? You were, transcended?

     DANIEL
     Ascended.

     BREGMAN
     Ascended?

     DANIEL
     Yeah. Well, actually, I did have the unfortunate experience of, um,
     dying, first. Uh, slowly and-
     and quite painfully, first, I might add.

   [Bregman opens his file, and Daniel reads over his shoulder.]

     BREGMAN
     Well, in your mission file, it says your human...I'm quoting here,
     your human body: "transformed into energy. A bright white light rose
     above the hospital bed." Is that...

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Yeah.

     BREGMAN

     ...accurate? So could you, Dr. Jackson, could you I don't
     know...Elaborate? I mean what-what-
     what did it feel like?

     DANIEL

     (mumbling)
     Well, I don't know. I-I really don't remember much after that.
     (Daniel's pager beeps, and he pulls it out to look at it.)
     Will you excuse me?

     BREGMAN
     Yeah.

   [Daniel takes off down the hall running. Bregman is startled and starts
   gesturing to the crew as he starts running as well.]

     BREGMAN
     Follow him. Come on, come on!

   [The documentary team follows Daniel, who is moving at top speed
   through the corridors, the camera filming the chase all the while.]

     BREGMAN

     (to camera crew)
     Move. Move! Move!

   [Bregman spots Daniel in his office and gestures for the crew to follow
   him in.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is by his fax machine, pulling out a paper that was just
   transmitted and reading it while coughing slightly. The documentary
   crew approaches.]

     BREGMAN
     Doctor Jackson? Doct What is it? What is it?

     DANIEL

     (speaking quickly)
     It's uh, the mask fragment I collected from P3X--

     BREGMAN
     I'm sorry, could you slow down?

     DANIEL

     (enunciating)
     The mask fragment I collected from P3X-298. It was carbon-dated to
     match the predynastic period of Egypt here on Earth.

     BREGMAN
     And could, what does could you get a close shot of this?

   The camera takes a close up shot of the fax. It reads as follows:

     INTERNAL FAX

     Pages 1 of 1
     To: Dr. Daniel Jackson
     Fax# Local #776

     LABORATORY RESULTS
     Dr. Daniel Jackson
     After extensive carbon testing of the main fragment that was
     collected from planet P3X-298, we find that it is to be dated to
     match the predynastic period of Egypt on Earth. Official results to
     be sent to your laboratory...[Daniel's hand obscures the rest]
     Thank you.
     Dr. Sam A[illegible]]

     BREGMAN
     What is the, uh...what is the significance of that?

     DANIEL

     (innocently)
     It's fascinating.

     BREGMAN

     It's fasc...Okay.
     (to crew)
     Back up. Back up.
     (to Daniel)
     Uh, that's it? It's fascinating? Then why were we running?

     DANIEL
     Oh, uh, I just wanted to see if you'd chase me.

   [He casts a deadpan look to the camera before turning his back,
   rereading the fax. Bregman waves to the camera in annoyance.]

     BREGMAN
     Okay. Turn it off. Turn it off. Get it get that mike away from me.
     Turn it off!

   [The camera clicks off.]

   INT--SGC SCIENCE LAB

   [Lee and other scientists are working in the science lab. One is
   soldering something on a MALP. Lee is speaking directly to the camera,
   tapping a kevlar helmet, as the documentary crew records the footage.]

     LEE
     Kevlar will not stop the energy blast from a staff weapon. And uh,
     the armor plating in other bullet-proof protection gets superheated
     from the plasma, so...

   [Lee has put down the helmet and picks up a shiny thin sheet of metal,
   knocking on it in demonstration.]

     LEE

     (continuing)
     ...while it would stop the penetration, the wearer is essentially
     trapped in what becomes their own personal microwave oven. And, uh,
     you know. Not a good idea.

   [Lee points to a protection vest worn by a scorched mannequin as he
   puts down the metal plate.]

     LEE
     Anyway, what we've been working on is this.

   [Lee picks up a thin, black, plastic square, and places it into the
   vest of the mannequin.]

     LEE
     A ceramic polymer which will resist the heat, stop the blast, and
     fits into a standard issue SG vest...which Sergeant Siler will now
     demonstrate for us.

   [Lee points out Siler, who is wearing a vest and helmet over top his
   usual dark blue BDU jumpsuit. Teal'c, wearing goggles, picks up a staff
   weapon nearby.]

     BREGMAN

     (low, to Lee)
     Wouldn't it be a better idea...
     (notices camera still recording Lee and him)
     No, no, don't shoot me. Shoot...

   [Bregman gestures over his shoulder to Siler. The camera pans over to
   show Siler placing goggles on his face. Lee and Bregman walk behind
   James and continue their low conversation.]

     BREGMAN
     Don't you think that it would be more interesting, you know, if I
     wore the vest?

     LEE

     (alarmed)
     No, no, no, no, no.

     BREGMAN
     Well, isn't it safe?

     LEE
     Well, absolutely, it's safe. It's not like we've never done this
     before.

   [While speaking, he gently pushes Bregman back, further out of range.]

     BREGMAN
     So?

     LEE
     No.

     SILER
     Away from the face, big guy.

   [Siler has barely finished putting on his goggles when Teal'c fires his
   weapon, knocking Siler against the padded wall and setting the vest
   afire. Siler collapses to the floor and stays still as an airman pours
   extinguisher over his body, snuffing out the flames.]

     SILER
     It's all good. I'm fine.

   [Bregman and Rundell stare at Siler in shock. Lee bites his finger.]

     LEE
     You see? Um, Yeah. See, he-he does that all that time.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The documentary crew interviews Carter, who is standing in front of
   the control stations.]

     CARTER
     The control room is sort of like the air traffic control tower of
     the base. We monitor all Gate activity from here.

     BREGMAN
     So what are all these blinking lights about? For example, what are
     those lights over there?

   [Bregman gestures to some equipment by the far wall. Carter moves over
   to it.]

     CARTER
     Well, this monitors the Gate's massive power consumption required to
     generate outgoing wormholes. Interestingly, in our study of offworld
     DHDs, we've found that our Gate actually draws 10% more wattage than
     offworld Gates. Now that far exceeds any potential loss due to our
     man-made interface. We think it has to do with the way that the
     super-conductive crystals inside the Gate absorb electrical energy,
     but we're also trying to demonstrate that the DHDs are somehow
     producing a-a purer, more efficient form of power.

   [Carter smiles in excitement. Bregman looks blank.]

     BREGMAN
     Could we get a shot of the Gate spinning?

     CARTER

     (sarcastically)
     Sure. It's really cool. Steam comes out of it and everything.

     BREGMAN
     Great.

     HARRIMAN
     Major?

   [Harriman approaches and whispers in Carter's ear.]

     CARTER
     Uh, sorry, guys. There's an SG team due to embark on a mission.

     BREGMAN

     (excited)
     Well, that's great! We'll get a shot of them leaving!

     CARTER
     Actually, you're going to have to leave.

     BREGMAN

     Can I ask you something? You've been
     (turns back to film crew)
     Sorry, you can stop shooting. Cut.

   [The camera shuts off.]

   EXT--P3X-666, DAY

   [SG-13 exits the active wormhole. The planet is full of grass and
   trees; the Stargate is in a clearing. A MALP is nearby.]

     DIXON
     Okay, Balinsky, which way?

     BALINSKY

     (checking a handheld device)
     That way.

     DIXON
     I'll take point. Wells, Bosworth, you're rear guard. Five-meter
     spread. Keep your eyes open.

     BALINSKY
     The MALP showed no indication of any recent Goa'uld activity on this
     planet.

     DIXON
     I don't see any indication of anything here.

     BALINSKY

     (holding up a small notebook)
     Take the usual bet on that, sir?

     DIXON
     Sure. Wells?

     WELLS
     Abandoned naquadah mine.

     DIXON
     Boring. But good odds. Bosworth?

     BOSWORTH
     I'm going to put my money on trees, sir.

     DIXON
     Bosworth's disqualified for being a smartass. I'll go with
     two-headed aliens.

     WELLS
     Hostile or friendly, sir?

     DIXON
     One head good, one head bad.

     DIXON
     Balinsky?

   [Balinsky gestures as if it is obvious.]

     BALINSKY
     Oh, the ruins of an ancient city.

     DIXON

     (smirking)
     Yeah, you wish.

   [SG-13 moves out and travel some distance from the Stargate.]

     DIXON
     Yeah, all night screaming. Projectile vomiting. Nuclear diapers. You
     have no idea. The reason they make them so damn cute is so you don't
     suffocate them in their sleep.

     WELLS
     Sir, you have four kids.

     DIXON
     Yeah, why do you think I enjoy my job so much? Don't get me wrong. I
     love the little buggers to death, but, trust me, having four kids
     makes going through a Stargate and facing off against alien bad guys
     look like nothing. This is relaxing.

   [Dixon grins and spreads his arms wide.]

     WELLS
     Then why'd you have four?

     DIXON
     Well, one's pretty bad, but you figure you gotta have two, so the
     little guy could have a brother or sister, right? Then you have two
     boys, and the wife says she wants a girl. So you figure, "Hell,
     three can't be much worse than two," right? What you don't realize
     is, your brain is fried because you haven't slept. After three, four
     is no big deal. You're so deep in it, nothing seems to matter
     anymore. It's chaos. You just try to make through each day alive. In
     the end, you spend all the energy you have left trying to get 'em
     into bed. Only to lie awake, praying they don't get hooked on drugs,
     hurt, or worse, wind up dead in an alley somewhere.

     WELLS
     Can't wait, sir.

     DIXON
     Yeah, miracle of birth my ass. I'll tell you what a miracle is.
     Birth control that works.

   [SG-13 enters a different clearing, and their jaws drop in shock.]

     DIXON
     Well, I'll be damned.

   [SG-13 stares at the ruins of an ancient city.]

     BALINSKY

     (stupefied)
     I win.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill pours himself some coffee, then sniffs it. Carter approaches.]

     CARTER
     Sir. Did you do your interview yet?

     O'NEILL

     (taking a drink)
     Yeah.

     CARTER
     Mary Steenburgen?

     O'NEILL
     She's so hot.

   [Carter giggles. They both start descending the staircase.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, can you tell me the reason for this documentary again?

     CARTER
     Didn't you read the memo?

   [O'Neill shoots her a look, which Carter acknowledges.]

     CARTER
     Officially, it's to chronicle the 1000th trip through the Stargate,
     but I think there's more to it than that.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

     O'NEILL
     One thousand you say?

     CARTER
     I know. Hard to believe we've been at it this long.

     O'NEILL
     There should be a cake.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [The documentary crew is set up in Daniel's office, trying to interview
   him. Bregman is sorting through his notes as Daniel waits for a
   question, looking bored and distracted.]

     BREGMAN

     Great, um, Dr. Jackson...I'm just gonna...Your memory was erased
     when you returned to let's--I'm quoting here: "human form." That
     sounds completely idiotic.
     (to Rundell)
     Could you remind me? Make a note. I have to re-ask that question.
     (to Daniel)
     Just, sorry, could you, you know? What can you tell us about all
     that?

   [Daniel raises his eyebrows at the question.]

     DANIEL
     Not much.

   [Bregman sighs and looks annoyed.]

     BREGMAN
     Okay, well, can you tell us a little bit about what things were like
     before that?

     DANIEL
     Oh, well, thankfully, I have most of those memories back. There are
     still a few...holes.

   [Daniel looks away, lost in thought.]

     BREGMAN

     Okay.
     (reading his notes)
     "The Pharoahs of the Fourth Dynasty did not build the pyramids."

     DANIEL
     No. No, they didn't. They're actually landing pads for Goa'uld
     motherships.

     BREGMAN
     No, I'm quoting you from a speech that you made before you were
     introduced to the Stargate. Now, I presume that at that time, you
     knew nothing about landing platforms or motherships, right?

     DANIEL
     Right. No.

   [Daniel looks puzzled.]

     BREGMAN
     Until you were introduced to Catherine Langford...

     DANIEL
     Right.

     BREGMAN
     And she's the one who introduced you to the Stargate program...

     DANIEL
     Right.

     BREGMAN
     So. Why?

     DANIEL
     Why what?

     BREGMAN

     (sighing in frustration)
     Um, why did she do that?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. You'd have to ask her.

     BREGMAN

     (after a pause)
     Okay, fine. Maybe I'll ask her. Is she transcended, or ascended, or
     something like that?

     DANIEL
     No, uh, retired, actually, but uh, you never know.

   [Daniel grins at the thought before noting the camera still recording
   and looks down again.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

   [The camera records Teal'c sitting silently. Bregman is nervously
   trying to interview him.]

     BREGMAN
     So, I'm just reading your file here. It's fascinating. I suppose I
     should ask you immediately here. You-you're an alien!

   [Teal'c does not respond.]

     BREGMAN

     (clearing throat)
     I mean, well, not to you. But to us you would be...Anyway, uh, you
     were the highest ranking officer, uh, in the service of one of our
     alien enemies, and you turned against them.

   [Teal'c does not move or respond.]

     BREGMAN
     Why did you turn against them...wh-when you did?

   [Teal'c does not move or respond. There is a long silence. Bregman
   sighs and looks back at Rundell and his crew.]

     BREGMAN
     I mean, could--sorry, why are you sitting there if you don't intend
     to answer any of my questions?

     TEAL'C
     Because I was requested to by General Hammond.

     BREGMAN
     I see. And he didn't happen to mention to you that part of the
     interview process involved actually saying something?

     TEAL'C
     No.

     BREGMAN

     (shifting in frustration)
     Okay, um...all right. Let's try this. Colonel Jack O'Neill. You must
     have a tremendous amount of respect for him.

   [Teal'c does not respond.]

     BREGMAN
     Or maybe you don't. Let me rephrase. Uh, Colonel Jack O'Neill is,
     uh, your immediate superior...okay, maybe not in terms of
     species...He's your commanding officer.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     BREGMAN
     Good! Okay! Good, good. Uh, terrific. Let's move forward. And is
     there anything that you can tell us about him?

     TEAL'C
     If you wish to learn of Colonel O'Neill, perhaps you should
     interview Colonel O'Neill.

     BREGMAN

     (flatly)
     Okay. Thanks. That's a good idea. Thank you very much. I want to ask
     you just let me ask you...

   [Teal'c stands and walks away.]

     BREGMAN
     Where you going?

   EXT--P3X-666, DAY

   [Wells and Bosworth are seated against a pillar. Dixon approaches
   Balinsky who is excitedly recording the Ancient text on the ruins with
   his camcorder.]

     DIXON
     How long?

     BALINSKY
     I don't know. Why? We just got here.

     DIXON
     An hour ago.

     BALINSKY
     Well, I need more time. I mean look at this place. It's incredible.

     DIXON
     Yeah, you've seen one crumbled city...

     BALINSKY

     (interrupting, excited)
     Sir, this place was built by the Ancients.

     DIXON
     Are you sure?

     BALINSKY
     Yes. These markings. And this stone architecture. Oh, Doctor
     Jackson's gonna die when he sees this.

     DIXON
     What, again?

     BALINSKY
     Funny.

   [Balinsky spots something in the distance. He gathers up all his
   equipment and hurries over.]

     DIXON
     Don't go far!

   [Dixon moves over to where Wells and Bosworth are sitting. Bosworth is
   holding up a photograph to the light.]

     BOSWORTH

     (shaking his head)
     It looks like an alien.

     WELLS

     (chuckling)
     Shut up.

     BOSWORTH
     Yeah. Hey, remember that thing we ran into on P2X-787?

     WELLS
     Get lost.

   [Wells takes back the picture.]

     BOSWORTH
     Yeah, see, that thing was easy on the eyes by comparison.

   [Dixon reaches the pair and snatches the photograph from Wells as he
   sits next to him.]

     DIXON
     Let me see. Uh, it's pretty scary, Wells.

     WELLS
     It's my unborn son, sir.

   [Dixon studies the ultrasound picture with a skeptical eye.]

     DIXON
     How can you tell?

   [Wells points out a part of the picture.]

     DIXON
     I don't know, Wells. I wouldn't paint the room blue just yet.

   [Balinsky runs towards them frantically.]

     BALINSKY
     Take cover!

   [SG-13 takes cover behind some of the stone ruins. A strange dome
   shaped metallic device with several tendrils trailing from the bottom
   comes into view. The device starts firing energy weapons at SG-13. They
   return fire, but the device is shielded.]

   [Balinsky observes the device moving close to a stone wall.]

     BALINSKY
     Colonel, now!

   [Dixon fires his weapon at the wall. It collapses onto the device,
   knocking it to the ground where it breaks apart.]

     DIXON
     Hold!

   [SG-13 moves away from their cover and cautiously approaches. Sparks
   fly from the still powered machine. SG-13 fire their guns at the device
   some more until it stops sparking.]

     DIXON
     What the hell is it?

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The camera is recording Senator Kinsey sitting in front of the window
   to the Gate room.]

     KINSEY
     Like the people who are now serving here at the SGC, the youth of
     tomorrow will one day have to defend the free spirit of mankind. And
     not just on our fair planet, but out there, through the Stargate, in
     the vastness of the galaxy, where untold evil with powers that we've
     never seen before are still waiting to prey upon us.

   [Kinsey nods knowingly. Bregman looks up from his bored position when
   he realizes Kinsey is finally done.]

     BREGMAN
     Okay. Cut.

   [James and Wickenhouse secure their equipment. Bregman rubs his face to
   awaken and claps his hands together.]

     BREGMAN
     Senator, great. Ha. Great. Thank you so much for doing this. It was
     really terrific of you to come and do this.

     KINSEY
     These people deserve it.

   [Kinsey points with his thumb over to Hammond and Rundell, who have
   been watching. Rundell whispers something in Hammond's ear and then
   leaves. Bregman comes over and shakes Kinsey's hand.]

     BREGMAN

     Yes, well they're trying their best. Senator, I hope you don't take
     this the wrong way...but, and don't mind me saying this, but...
     (leaning close and whispering)
     It sounded a little bit prepared. Just a little bit like a speech. I
     don't think you're gonna like the results. What about if we do it
     off the cuff, and I just kinda throw things at you, see how you
     respond?

     KINSEY
     No.

     BREGMAN
     No?

     KINSEY
     No. Now, if you want anything else from me...

   [Kinsey stands and begins walking out of the room.]

     BREGMAN
     Yes, actually, uh, Senator?

   [Hammond watches, bemused, as Bregman chases Kinsey out of the room.]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Kinsey, followed by his secret service detail and the documentary
   crew, approaches O'Neill in the crowded commissary. O'Neill is sitting
   at a table, reading a report and eating some fruit.]

     KINSEY
     Ah, Colonel! As I'm sure you know, I'm here to be a part of the
     piece these good men are putting together to document the fine work
     you're doing here at the SGC.

   [Bregman whispers to James and Wickenhouse.]

     O'NEILL

     (not looking up)
     No, I didn't know that.

     KINSEY

     (with a false laugh)
     Oh, well, I'm-I'm sure there was a memo.

   [O'Neill looks up from his paperwork and over his shoulder. He sees
   Bregman still whispering to James as James raises his camera.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, did you tell them about the time you tried to get this place
     shut down? Or the time you had Hammond by the short ?

     KINSEY

     (interrupting in a low, threatening voice)
     I suggest you watch what you say, Colonel. Slander is a serious
     offense.

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     Yes, so I hear.

   [Kinsey glances back and smiles again when he observes the camera
   crew.]

     KINSEY

     (louder)
     I have always been a strong supporter of this program. I admit I was
     critical in the past, but that was only because of the unrealized
     potential I see this operation as having.

   [O'Neill closes his report.]

     KINSEY
     How did your interview go, Colonel?

     O'NEILL

     (standing)
     It was short, yet, oh so sweet.

   [O'Neill glances back at Bregman, who chuckles at O'Neill's response.]

     KINSEY
     The President wants you to play ball on this. I hope you're not
     intending to disappoint our Commander-in-Chief. I would think you
     would want to show your appreciation for his backing over the years.

     O'NEILL
     Kinsey, what are you doing here? I mean, the last time anyone
     checked, you were trying to discredit the guy.

   [Bregman leans closer. James and Wickenhouse record the whole
   conversation. Everyone in the commissary watches with interest.]

     KINSEY
     His term is up. My running mate and I are merely pointing out to the
     American people certain areas that we think we can do a better job
     in. And when that time comes...I know we can count on your vote,
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Yeah, that'll happen.

   [O'Neill begins to leave the commissary. Kinsey follows, stopping him
   at the door.]

     KINSEY
     And I want you to know this. If elected, this program can count on
     our full support.

     O'NEILL

     (to the documentary crew)
     You want to get this?

     BREGMAN

     (shrugging)
     Sure.

   [There is a long pause.]

     O'NEILL
     You smarmy self-righteous, opportunistic, ass--.

   [Klaxons blare drowning out much of O'Neill's rant.]

     VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER
     Unscheduled offworld activation. Colonel O'Neill to the control
     room. Repeat. Unscheduled offworld activation.

     O'NEILL

     (while the alert is going on, the following is mostly
     indecipherable)
     ...you are not going to....son of a bitch.

     KINSEY

     (fuming)
     Duty calls.

     O'NEILL

     (turning to crew)
     I was done.

     BREGMAN
     Colonel, what is this "offworld activation" something?

     O'NEILL
     I won't know until I get there.

     BREGMAN

     (signaling his crew)
     Well, that's great. Where's...there?

     O'NEILL
     There is here for you.

   [O'Neill leaves the commissary. Rundell stands in front of the door.
   Kinsey still stands there fuming.]

     RUNDELL
     Ongoing activity.

   [Rundell points to James, and the camera shuts off.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Dixon and Balinsky appear on a monitor from the MALP camera on
   P3X-666.]

     DIXON

     (via video link)
     Balinsky wants to stay, sir.

   [Hammond, Carter, O'Neill, Harriman, and Daniel are all watching the
   video feed.]

     O'NEILL
     Do you see anything else worth staying for, Dave?

     DIXON

     (looking around before facing the camera)
     Hard to say.

     BALINSKY

     (on video)
     We need to finish searching these ruins.

     HAMMOND
     How long?

     BALINSKY

     (on video)
     A day or two. Maybe more.

     DANIEL
     It would be nice to send an UAV. At least get an aerial overview.

     HAMMOND
     Permission to remain granted. I'll send SG-3 as back up. Any sign of
     further threat, you get out of there immediately, Colonel.

   [Balinsky moves out of the MALP camera view.]

     DIXON
     Understood, sir.

     CARTER
     In the meantime, I can run some tests on what's left of the device,
     see what it's been doing there.

     HAMMOND
     Send the device back and report in on the hour.

     DIXON
     Yes, sir. SG-13 out.

   [Dixon shuts off the camera, and the wormhole disengages. Hammond
   starts to leave, but O'Neill stops him.]

     O'NEILL
     Sir...um, it's not that I don't appreciate...

     HAMMOND

     (interrupting)
     I knew Kinsey and Bregman were headed your way, and I thought you
     might be looking for an excuse to get away, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     I thought as much, sir. And I just wanted to express my deep and
     unyielding...love for you, sir.

   [Rundell approaches from the far end of the room.]

     RUNDELL
     General, if you have a moment, Mr. Bregman would like a word.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Bregman stands in Hammond's office, arguing with the general, who is
   seated at his desk, reading aloud from a file.]

     HAMMOND
     "Exempt from said clearance are all current activities which have
     not yet been reviewed by this office." That being the Pentagon.

     BREGMAN
     "Current activities"? Breathing is a current activity.

     HAMMOND
     My interpretation is that you have not been authorized to know
     anything about the most recent unscheduled activation.

     BREGMAN

     (sitting in chair across from Hammond)
     General, I need a little leeway.

     HAMMOND
     I said that I was going to hold you to the letter of these orders,
     Mr. Bregman. Give it up.

   [Bregman stands, clearly frustrated. He opens the door to leave, then
   turns back.]

     BREGMAN
     You know, Colonel O'Neill...

     HAMMOND

     (interrupting)
     ...is currently unavailable.

     BREGMAN
     General, the President-the President of the United States is giving
     me his full support. Why are you resisting?

     HAMMOND
     I'm not resisting. I'm following orders. My opinion is that I don't
     think my people need to be put under a microscope. Cameras don't
     just record things. They change what they record simply by being
     there. The work these people do is hard enough without them feeling
     that every breath they take is being preserved for judgment.

     BREGMAN
     Maybe it should be.

     HAMMOND
     Excuse me?

     BREGMAN

     (closing the door)
     I said, maybe it should be. The Pentagon has allowed journalists to
     be embedded with the Armed Forces before this. You know that. Under
     fire. Under pressure. So what's seen, and what's heard, and what's
     read is the truth.

     HAMMOND
     I think we're through.

     BREGMAN

     (changing tactics)
     I don't-I don't disagree with you, General...

   [He starts to sit again. The red phone rings.]

     HAMMOND
     Excuse me.

   [Hammond reaches over to the phone and lifts the receiver. Bregman
   remains seated. Hammond holds the phone away from his ear with the
   mouthpiece covered and glares at Bregman. Hesitantly, Bregman leaves
   the office.]

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter and Teal'c study the device that attacked SG-13 on P3X-666.
   Carter adjusts various wires connected to the device.]

     CARTER
     You ever seen anything like this?

     TEAL'C
     I have not.

     CARTER
     Well, it's definitely a remote probe of some kind. The storage
     capacity of the memory crystals is immense, but so far, all I've
     found are detailed images of the ruins. You know, it makes sense. We
     use a-a MALP. Why wouldn't the Goa'uld?

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld are scavengers. It is quite possible they got the idea
     from us.

     CARTER
     So, you do your interview with the documentary crew yet?

     TEAL'C

     (grimacing)
     Indeed.

     CARTER

     (excited)
     You know, I have to admit, I can't wait to hear what everyone else
     said.

     TEAL'C
     I did not say much.

   [Carter fails to suppress her amusement.]

     CARTER

     (sarcastically)
     Really? That is surprising. It's usually so hard to shut you up.

   [Teal'c raises his eyebrow. She grins back at him.]

     TEAL'C
     I found the entire experience unpleasant.

     CARTER
     They want to talk to me again.

     TEAL'C
     Did your interview not go well, either?

     CARTER

     (defensively)
     Well, I thought it was fine. But apparently, I looked...nervous.

   [She continues to look put-out while Teal'c studies her.]

     TEAL'C
     Hmm.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [James changes videotapes in the camcorder while Wickenhouse checks the
   boom microphone and wraps extra cord. Bregman heads towards Rundell.]

     BREGMAN
     What is the meaning of "offworld activation"? What is that about?

     RUNDELL
     I'm not privy to that information.

     BREGMAN

     (scoffing)
     And you wouldn't tell me even if you knew, would you?

     RUNDELL
     We have orders.

     BREGMAN
     You remind me of those minders we used to have in the Gulf. They
     used to censor our reports.

     RUNDELL
     Look, it's not as if we're conspiring to cover up the truth.

     BREGMAN
     Oh, sure.

     RUNDELL
     And censoring reports in combat just makes sense.

     BREGMAN
     Makes sense?

     RUNDELL
     You do not jeopardize the lives of troops of ongoing missions.

     BREGMAN

     Makes sense? It makes no sense. It's a documentary. It's not the
     news. What are you telling me, you're broadcasting this to the enemy
     on some other planet? Look, I-I have been denied access to several
     prior mission files. You know why? Because no one wants me to know
     how close we've come to well, why don't you tell me, Tom? You're not
     conspiring to cover the truth, are you?
     Why don't you tell me? We've come close to what?

     RUNDELL

     (reluctantly)
     Being compromised.

     BREGMAN
     Being compromised. There's a euphemism for you. Being compromised.
     Close to the brink of planetary annihilation is probably more
     accurate! That's why we're not allowed to film these ongoing
     activities. Because every time they open that Gate, there's a chance
     that something could go cataclysmically wrong.

     WICKENHOUSE
     In which case, it wouldn't really matter what we had on tape, would
     it?

   [James laughs. Bregman turns to them angrily.]

     BREGMAN
     What did you say? What did you say? That it doesn't matter? If
     that's your opinion, and if you had any integrity at all, then you
     would resign before I had to replace you.

   [James and Wickenhouse sober at Bregman's tirade.]

     WICKENHOUSE
     I'd rather be replaced than be court-martialed. I'm not going to do
     anything I'm not authorized to do.

     BREGMAN
     Now, see, with that attitude...

     RUNDELL

     (talking over him)
     The bottom line is the SGC is not going to let any of this out until
     it's declassified.

     BREGMAN
     Well, what's the difference, then? Why not shoot it now and decide
     later?

     RUNDELL
     It's not up to me.

     BREGMAN

     (disgusted)
     "Not up to me." "Not up to me."

   [The elevator door opens and O'Neill steps out. When he spots the
   documentary crew, he tries to return to the elevator car, but Bregman
   notices him immediately.]

     BREGMAN
     Colonel! Colonel. We're all set up for you right here. We're all set
     up.

   [O'Neill braces himself as if running a gauntlet and walks swiftly by
   the crew.]

     O'NEILL
     Briefing.

     BREGMAN
     Yeah. No. Colonel. Colonel. Colonel!

   [O'Neill pauses at the base of the stairs to the control room. The
   camera has turned towards him.]

     BREGMAN
     You know, I'm going to get you on camera sooner or later, even if
     all I get is a series of shots of you avoiding being got.

     O'NEILL
     Fire away. I hope shots of my ass serve you well.

   [O'Neill climbs up the stairs into the control room. Bregman scoffs in
   frustration.]

     BREGMAN

     (to crew)
     All right, pack up. What are we doing here?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Bregman interviews Carter.]

     BREGMAN
     How do you feel about Colonel O'Neill?

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Uh...he's an amazing man. After everything he's done, he's still
     modest. Quite self-effacing, actually. He even likes people to think
     he's not as smart as he really is. Bottom line, he's an incredibly
     strong leader who has given more of himself for this program than
     any man has given for...well...anything I can imagine.

     BREGMAN
     Do you spend a lot of time together outside of work?

     CARTER
     Uh, we don't get much time outside of work. When we do, um, our
     personal interests are a little different.

     BREGMAN
     Huh. Did you ever hear the expression "opposites attract"?

     CARTER
     We have very professional relationship.

     BREGMAN
     Professional. Really? After everything you've been through? You must
     have dare I say well, it's not too much to say, faced death
     together?

   [Carter appears slightly irritated.]

     CARTER
     Yeah. Not unlike countless military personnel throughout the years.
     Look, I-I won't deny that there's a bond between us. Daniel and
     Teal'c are also like family to me. Colonel O'Neill is first and
     foremost my superior officer. Even if there was potential for
     something more and I'm-I'm not saying that there is our military
     positions and-and the very nature of our job wouldn't allow for it.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The documentary crew is interviewing Harriman.]

     HARRIMAN
     Well, basically when the Gate is dialing, I say "chevron one
     encoded, chevron two encoded," and so on, incrementally, up to the
     seventh chevron, which is a little different because that's when the
     wormhole connects. When that happens, I-I like to change things up a
     little bit and just say, "chevron seven locked."

   [The other technicians give Harriman sidelong, skeptical looks.]

     BREGMAN
     "Locked." That's great. That's good. Anything else?

     HARRIMAN
     Oh yeah. Um, I'm responsible for this.

   [He places his palm on the iris control.]

     HARRIMAN
     Close the iris.

   [Bregman looks into the Gate Room, where the iris closes.]

     BREGMAN
     Open the iris.

   [The iris opens. Harriman leans back and crosses his arms proudly.]

     BREGMAN
     Huh.

     HARRIMAN
     That's pretty much my job right there.

     BREGMAN
     That's it?

     HARRIMAN

     (smile faltering)
     Yeah, pretty much.

     BREGMAN
     I think you're being a little modest.

     HARRIMAN
     Oh, I mean, d-don't get me wrong. I mean it's-it's really rewarding.
     It-it really is. And we have tried various automated scenarios, but
     uh, the SG teams just agree that-that, you know, when they send
     their iris code through the wormhole, they like to know that there's
     a-there's a real person on the other end. Someone that they can
     trust to get it right. And, uh, that gives me and the-the other gate
     technicians a great sense of pride.

   [The other technicians give Harriman more sidelong glances.]

     BREGMAN
     Sure. That's good.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is sorting through various items, packing some in his day pack.
   His camera and other supplies are scattered across the work table.
   Bregman approaches the doorway.]

     BREGMAN
     Uh, Doctor Jackson? Hi.

     DANIEL

     (after a pause)
     Hey, how's it going?

     BREGMAN
     So, you're packing? You're going on a mission off I'm sorry, I
     forgot the expression.

     DANIEL

     (Still packing)
     Offworld?

     BREGMAN
     Offworld? Is that it? So you're going?

     DANIEL
     Nope. No. Just going through my pack.

     BREGMAN

     (pointing to camcorder)
     That's the camera you use, though, right?

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [Bregman picks up the camcorder.]

     BREGMAN
     I've seen hours and hours of your footage. Hours of it. Inscriptions
     and ruins and...artifacts.

     DANIEL

     (grinning)
     Cool, huh?

   [Bregman hands the camera back to Daniel.]

     BREGMAN
     Uh, I wonder. Uh, if you get the opportunity, um, maybe you could
     point your camera at some action, you know, just for a change. Okay?

     DANIEL
     See, that's the thing, when there's action, I-I'm too busy to be
     pointing a camera. I'm, you know, running, shooting, translating
     what the bad guys are saying, that kind of thing. Yep.

     BREGMAN

     (backing up)
     It's just that, you know...for me, I mean, I've heard a lot about
     these amazing events. Unfortunately, my medium is visual. I can't
     tell the real story unless I have pictures. I'm not suggesting you
     put anybody in danger, not yourself...But, you know, if the
     opportunity arises, just, you know, take a second and just point
     your lens at something, you know, that moves.

   [Daniel looks at his watch dramatically.]

     DANIEL
     Right. I'm not really scheduled to go on a mission offworld for
     another couple of days...

   [Daniel shrugs and his voice trails off as he looks at Bregman with
   false apology.]

     BREGMAN
     No, no, no, no. If it's there. Shoot it.

     DANIEL

     (smiling falsely)
     Right.

     BREGMAN
     Just not the inscriptions all the time. Just some action would be
     good. Action.

   [Bregman backs out of the office, making a running gesture with his
   body before backing out of sight. Daniel shoves things back into his
   pack more forcefully, glaring at where Bregman exited and shaking his
   head in annoyance.]

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter is interfacing the alien device with her computers. Daniel
   enters.]

     DANIEL
     Hey.

     CARTER
     Hey. One second.

     DANIEL
     You, uh, you wanted me to translate something?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I'm just trying to get the interface connection more stable.
     SG-13 really kicked the crap out of this thing. Its system log seems
     to be isolated on a separate crystal from memory control.

     DANIEL
     You know, Bregman actually had the nerve to suggest that all that
     archive video footage I gave him was boring?

   [Carter looks up at Daniel, trying unsuccessfully to make her face
   sympathetic.]

     DANIEL
     Ah. Okay, here's what really bugs me. The only reason he's here is
     because this President is on his way out and he knows it, right? He
     just doesn't want to look bad if and when the Stargate program ever
     goes public. None of this is about truth, it's all about political
     posturing.

     CARTER
     Man, he really grilled me on that.

     DANIEL
     On what? Whether the Stargate program should go public?

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     What did you say?

     CARTER
     I babbled incoherently.

     DANIEL
     I mean, could you imagine if it ever did?

     CARTER
     I try not to think about it.

   [Data written in the Goa'uld language pours down the screen. Carter
   adjusts the screen so that the pattern stabilizes.]

     CARTER
     There.

   [Daniel scans it quickly.]

     DANIEL

     (reading)
     It's mostly just technical stuff.

     CARTER
     Anything jump out at you?

     DANIEL

     (pointing to screen)
     Well, here's where it encountered SG-13...uh-oh.

     CARTER
     What-what, uh oh?

     DANIEL

     (worried)
     Well, after it engaged shields and weapons, it activated a
     long-range communicator.

   [Now, Carter also looks worried.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond stands by the microphone, the Stargate's active wormhole
   reflecting on his face.]

     HAMMOND

     (into comm)
     Colonel Dixon, this is General Hammond, we have reason to believe
     the Goa'uld probe sent out a subspace transmission prior to your
     disabling of it. I'm ordering you to return to Stargate Command
     immediately.

   EXT--RUINS, P3X-666, DAY

   [Balinsky studies ruins in the background as Dixon keys his radio.]

     DIXON

     (into radio)
     Roger that, sir. Estimate arrival time fifteen minutes. Dixon out.

   [Dixon stands and approaches Balinsky.]

     DIXON
     Pack it up, Doctor. We're going home.

   [Balinsky looks dejected but starts to comply.]

     DIXON

     (keying radio)
     Wells, Bosworth.

   EXT--FOREST, P3X-666, DAY

   [Wells and Bosworth stroll down a forest path.]

     WELLS

     (into radio)
     Wells here.

     DIXON

     (via radio)
     Bring it home, boys. We're booking out.

     WELLS
     Roger that. Wells out.

     BOSWORTH
     It's about time.

   [A staff blast suddenly strikes Wells in the back. He collapses to the
   ground face-first with a grunt. Bosworth immediately aims his weapon in
   the direction of the enemy fire, straddling Wells's body to protect it.
   He exchanges fire with unseen Jaffa.]

     BOSWORTH

     (keying radio)
     We're taking fire!

   EXT--RUINS, P3X-666, DAY

   [Dixon and Balinsky exchange concerned looks as they receive Bosworth's
   transmission.]

     BOSWORTH

     (over radio)
     Wells has been hit!

     DIXON

     (pointing to Balinsky)
     Get to the Gate!

   [Balinsky starts to run. Dixon following.]

     DIXON

     (keying radio)
     SG-niner. Requesting assistance.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [The documentary crew is interviewing Fraiser. She is glancing through
   a large pile of folders, wearing her white frock over top her uniform.
   Behind her, nurses treat Siler for injuries on his torso.]

     FRAISER

     (reading report)
     Okay, three gunshot wounds. Four staff weapon burns. Severe
     hypothermia. And I'm quite surprised he's actually authorized me to
     discuss all this. It's just... Nanite technology artificially aged
     him...He had his shoulder punctured by an alien time capsule device.
     Um, three knee operations.

   [She puts one folder aside, and picks up another one.]

     FRAISER

     (setting the folder quickly aside)
     Oh, that's the whole Hathor incident which he's asked me never to
     discuss. And, oh yeah, this was a good one. Last year, he was
     exposed to an Ancient incurable disease.

     BREGMAN
     Obviously not incurable, right? Or...

     FRAISER
     Well, fortunately, there was a Tok'ra symbiote in need of a
     temporary host at the time. It managed to do the trick.

     BREGMAN

     (shaking his head slowly)
     I don't understand a word you just said, but it sounds amazing that
     Colonel O'Neill is alive.

     FRAISER

     (grinning)
     Yeah, you know, I never know what's next. You just try and keep your
     head on straight. Then again, we also set a lot of broken bones and
     prescribe a ton of antibiotics, so...

     BREGMAN
     Still, it sometimes must be overwhelming, right?

     FRAISER
     Yeah. It's funny. You know, you think all the training, everything
     we know about medicine, really, it amounts to very little. I mean,
     often I'm faced with situations that there's really nothing I can
     do.

     BREGMAN
     Is there an upside?

     FRAISER
     Are you kidding me? I think the reason we all manage to persevere is
     because we feel that we're on the brink of understanding so much
     more. And not just about medicine, but about who we are. You know,
     where we came from, what the future has in store, how we fit into
     the grand scheme of things.

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Unscheduled offworld activation. Repeat. Unscheduled offworld
     activation.

   [Klaxons blare. Fraiser and the documentary crew look up and listen to
   the announcement.]

     BREGMAN

     (gesturing upwards with his finger)
     That...unscheduled off...we've heard that before. Is that an unusual
     thing?

     FRAISER
     No. It happens from time to time.

     BREGMAN
     And what-what does it mean?

     FRAISER

     (shaking her head blankly)
     Your guess is as good as mine.

   [Bregman chuckles and scratches his head.]

     BREGMAN

     (to Wickenhouse)
     You got that announcement in the clear?

     WICKENHOUSE
     Yeah, we're good.

     BREGMAN

     Okay, good. Thank you, Doctor Fraiser.
     (to crew)
     You know what, guys, why don't you go roll some cutaways and get
     some sound bites over there?

   [He gestures over to where the staff is treating Siler and other
   patients at the other side of the room. Fraiser shifts in her seat
   confused.]

     FRAISER
     So this...?

   [Fraiser makes a cutting motion across her neck.]

     BREGMAN

     (to Fraiser)
     Yeah, we're good. Thank you. Appreciate it.

   [James and Wickenhouse move their equipment. Fraiser stands and picks
   up her pile of folders.]

     BREGMAN

     (to crew)
     Anything you can, okay? Okay?

   [Wickenhouse accidentally hits Bregman in the head with the boom
   microphone as he moves.]

     WICKENHOUSE
     Sorry.

     BREGMAN
     Ow. Ow. What-what? Yes, I know you're...I'm glad the Pentagon sent
     you. Just go away.

   [He maneuvers Wickenhouse past him forcefully. Fraiser makes a face,
   concealing her amusement.]

     BREGMAN

     (to Fraiser)
     Um, listen. I was just wondering. So it seems like the-uh-the
     unpredictable happens around here a lot.

     FRAISER

     (laughing)
     Yes, pretty much.

     BREGMAN
     Yeah, yeah. Um, and you're not going to be needed for this thing?

     FRAISER
     Well, if I am, they know where to find me.

   [James records the nurses treating Siler for a few moments. Then the
   camera drifts over to record Bregman and Fraiser's continued
   conversation. Rundell is waiting in the background, checking his
   watch.]

     BREGMAN
     I was just asking because I was thinking of getting something to eat
     in the cafeteria which I'm not even sure where...

     FRAISER

     (pointing)
     It's that way.

   [James zooms in on the pair as Rundell walks out of camera range.]

     BREGMAN
     And I was just wondering...

     FRAISER

     (finishing his thought)
     ...If I would like to join you?

     BREGMAN

     (smiling)
     Yeah.

     FRAISER

     (nodding)
     Okay. Yeah.

   [Out of the corner of his eye, Bregman notices James recording them.]

     BREGMAN
     What are you doing? What are you doing?

   [Fraiser turns around, startled.]

     JAMES
     I'm just white balancing.

     BREGMAN

     (waving him away, very annoyed)
     Well, go balance the white somewhere else, okay? Somewhere else!

     FRAISER

     (indicating her folders)
     I'm going to dump these first, okay?

   [James moves the camera back to record the nurses treating Siler.]

     BREGMAN

     (off camera)
     Okay. Yeah.

     FRAISER

     (off camera)
     Great.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Balinsky is dirty and in shock. Out of breath, he tries to give a
   report to Hammond, speaking quickly.]

     BALINSKY
     Wells is alive, but he's hurt badly, and he can't be moved.

   [O'Neill swings into the room at top speed.]

     O'NEILL
     How many Jaffa?

     BALINSKY
     I don't know.

     O'NEILL
     Five, ten, a hundred, what?

     BALINSKY
     Uh, Colonel Dixon counted six. They were able to fend them off.
     They're holding their position, protecting Wells.

     HAMMOND
     Did the Jaffa come through the Gate?

     BALINSKY
     No, no. They had to come by ship. SG-3 was covering the Gate.

     O'NEILL

     (surprised)
     The Gate's clear?

     BALINSKY
     Half of SG-3 were still there when I left.

     O'NEILL
     Gen--

     HAMMOND
     Take SG-5 and 7 and Doctor Fraiser.

     O'NEILL

     (already moving back to the door)
     Thank you, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel...

     O'NEILL

     (turning back)
     Yes, sir? I know. It sounds like an ambush to me too, but there's
     nothing else we can do, right?

     HAMMOND
     Right. Go.

   [Balinsky fights back tears, looking very worried.]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Fraiser eats a fruit cocktail. Bregman watches her, besotted, a
   half-eaten sandwich on his plate. Fraiser looks up and catches him
   staring.]

     BREGMAN

     Oh, sorry. I was just-I was just thinking that you have a very
     natural quality.
     (Fraiser stifles a smile by covering her mouth with her napkin)
     I mean, on camera. You let me film you allow people to see grace
     under pressure.

   [Fraiser has a bemused expression on her face as she picks up her mug.]

     FRAISER
     Hmm. Are you, um, are you flirting with me?

     BREGMAN

     (chuckling uncomfortably)
     Well, see, I, on the other hand, am very clumsy under pressure.

     FRAISER

     (laughing)
     Well, I've seen worse.

   [She watches as his left hand strokes his coffee mug, a ring that looks
   like a wedding band visible on his left hand.]

     FRAISER

     (sobering)
     So, uh, what's with the ring?

     BREGMAN

     (startled and staring at his hand)
     Oh, uh, it's just sentimental. My wife died a few years ago. So how
     do any of you have a personal life?

     FRAISER
     We don't really. I spend most of my time outside work with my
     daughter.

     BREGMAN

     (trying to hide his disappointment)
     Oh, so you're-you're married.

     FRAISER
     No. No. She's adopted.

     BREGMAN

     (hopeful)
     Oh.

     FRAISER
     Mm-hmm. She's from another planet.

   [Fraiser quickly takes a bite of fruit cocktail and watches Bregman's
   reaction carefully. He pauses, eyes wide, before swallowing his coffee.
   Fraiser watches him, a smile tugging at her lips as she chews her
   food.]

     BREGMAN
     Okay. Um, would you be willing to talk about that on camera?

     FRAISER

     (swallowing)
     You know, I'd rather...

   [Airman Bradley enters the commissary and stands by their table.]

     BRADLEY
     Excuse me, ma'am? You're required in the ready room immediately.

     FRAISER

     Thank you.
     (to Bregman as she stands)
     Sorry.

     BREGMAN
     That's okay.

   [He rises as she leaves the table, then sits, lost in thought.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Rundell and SFs herd James and Wickenhouse over to a side corridor,
   out of the main hallway.]

     RUNDELL
     Let's go, gentlemen.

   [The film crew spots SG-1 coming down the hall in full combat gear,
   another SG team behind them. James pauses, but Rundell continues to
   push him out of the way.]

     DANIEL

     (annoyed with himself)
     It's all because I wanted an aerial survey.

     CARTER

     (annoyed with herself)
     It took me too long to figure out the probe sent a transmission.

     O'NEILL

     (calmly)
     None of that matters now.

   [SG-1 and the other team continue towards the Gate Room. James,
   Wickenhouse, and Rundell stare after them in shock.]
