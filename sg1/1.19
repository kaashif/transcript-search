   TEASER

   [Offworld in a dark building. After coming up of a ladder, we have a
   view on a Stargate. When it shuts down, we see SG-1 that just came
   through the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your Colonel speaking. Welcome to P3X
     niner-eight-niner, where it's a balmy...room temperature...Fan it
     out!

   [They start investigating the chamber they are in. O'Neill is looking
   at a ball of light which is suspended from the ceiling above them.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa...Well the lights are on...but there's nobody home!

     DANIEL
     The technology seems advanced by comparison to what we've seen on
     most of the human-inhabited planets. Maybe they are more advanced
     than Earth.

     CARTER
     They're much more.

     DANIEL
     Well, it feels older...somehow.

     O'NEILL
     I know how it feels. This place have seen better days.

   [SG-1 explores the compound.]

     DANIEL
     At least it doesn't appear to be a Goa'uld origin.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, have you run into something like this?

     TEAL'C
     I have not.

     CARTER
     Computer.

     SG-1 arrives at what a control room, filled with banks of computers.
     Carter touches one of the computers, triggering an unusual sound.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that sounds ominous! Fall back.

   [They are making their way back to the Gate when they are suddenly zap
   by a light and they all fall down on the floor.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--LABORATORY

   [We see O'Neill waking up. The four members of SG-1 are all lying down
   in a room, each dressed in black clothes. O'Neill looks confused.
   Carter is lying down on the table next to him.]

     CARTER
     Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     Carter.

     CARTER
     Whoa...How did we get into these outfits?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know.

   [O'Neill gets up.]

     O'NEILL
     Welcome to PX3-989.

   [Carter also stands up as O'Neill is moving towards the rest of his
   team members. Everything is still dark.]

     CARTER
     My transmitter's gone.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel? Teal'c? You guys are okay?

   [Carter stops at Daniel's table, while O'Neill goes over to help
   Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     I am well.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I'm fine.

   [Daniel sits up.]

     DANIEL
     Better than fine actually, when you consider the fact that we are
     just...

   [He doesn't have the time to finish his sentence when someone enters
   the room.]

     HARLAN
     Com-traya! Com-traya!

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     I think that's a greeting.

     HARLAN
     Yes, it is.

     DANIEL
     Oh! Well then...uh...Com-traya. We are explorers from a place call
     Earth. I'm Daniel. Hello.

   [He holds out his hand to the man.]

     HARLAN
     Oh! This is your custom, yes? Hello!

     HARLAN

     (To Daniel)
     You are the leader?

     DANIEL

     Oh, no. That will be...
     (He points to O'Neill)

     O'NEILL
     Me! Colonel Jack O'Neill. Cumbaya.

     HARLAN

     Com-traya.
     (He laughs kindly at O'Neill.)

     O'NEILL
     Whatever. Why did you attack us?

     HARLAN
     Attack? Oh, attack, yes, of course. It would seem that way from your
     perceptive. Yes, I did that.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     HARLAN
     It could not be helped! Oh, are you suffering any pain? Any after
     effects? Occasionally the heart must be restarted.

     DANIEL
     Oh, no. I think that we feel fine.

     HARLAN

     Ah, Com-traya! You are all such wonderful specimens!
     (Turns to Carter.)
     You in particular, female!

     CARTER
     Colonel?

   [Carter moves towards Harlan.]

     O'NEILL

     Easy Captain.
     (To Harlan)
     Listen, we had some things...when we got here...some weapons.

     HARLAN
     Oh, those, hmm. Yes. Very dangerous.

     O'NEILL
     Very. Can we have them back?

     CARTER
     And our uniforms?

     HARLAN
     Sorry, but they are gone. This is better, yes?

   [Harlan touches Carter's shoulder.]

     CARTER
     No.

   [Carter moves away from Harlan.]

     HARLAN

     I am Harlan.
     (He holds out his hand to Daniel.)
     I am the last survivor of Altar.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me? The last survivor? You're the only one of this planet?

     HARLAN
     Yes. And your weapons are this way.

   [SG-1 follow Harlan through the complex.]

     HARLAN
     We are in section 3. There has been trouble here lately.

     CARTER
     What kind of trouble?

     HARLAN
     Mechanical breakdowns. Very difficult to maintain this complex all
     alone.

     O'NEILL
     Listen, Harlan, is there an outside of this place?

     HARLAN
     Outside is above, we are under.

     DANIEL
     Under...the surface?

     HARLAN
     Oh yes, on the surface we cannot survive. Hmm, radiation. Very, very
     bad. Ah! This way to section 4!

     DANIEL
     Eh, what happened to your civilisation? Surely, you started on the
     surface and then move under.

     HARLAN
     Oh, yes, long ago!

     DANIEL
     We are curious to learn about others worlds, we would love to hear
     about what happened on the surface.

     HARLAN
     All in time.

     O'NEILL
     We've got all the time in the world!

   [Harlan chuckles in response to this.]

     HARLAN
     Yes, you do. You understand? Com-traya!

     O'NEILL
     Now, what is that "Com-traya!", is that like "Aloha"?

     DANIEL
     Harlan, how long have you been on your own?

     HARLAN

     Eh, now, let me see, Wallas was the last one to go. I miss him. But,
     you all remind me a little of Wallas. Eh, except for you, of course,
     you are a female.
     (Harlan turns from Carter to Teal'c.)
     And you are...whatever you are.
     (Teal'c and O'Neill glance at each other.)
     Hubald, he was the creator of all this, but he died very early...too
     early...Many secrets with him, so long ago.

     O'NEILL
     How long, exactly?

     HARLAN
     Eh, exactly? Ninety-nine million, two hundred and seven thousand of
     your hours.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's 11,000 years.

     CARTER
     How did you know that?

     O'NEILL

     (Startled)
     That's right?

     CARTER

     (Thinking)
     Yeah.

     DANIEL

     (To O'Neill)
     Wait, how did you know that?

     HARLAN
     See. Everything is better. Even your minds. You are all much, much
     better!

     O'NEILL
     Better than what?

     HARLAN
     You do not feel it? You are not stronger? Smarter?

     DANIEL
     Jack, I think he's right. I feel great.

     HARLAN
     Of course you do. Because I have given you a great gift. I have made
     you all...better!

     O'NEILL
     Better, how?

     HARLAN
     Oh, I have not hurt you! I have only made you...better.

     O'NEILL
     All right, listen, listen closely, I'm going to ask you one more
     time, very simply, better...how?!

   [Harlan doesn't answer.]

     O'NEILL
     We're gone! We're out of here!

   [SG-1 head back towareds the Stargate. Harlan looks worried. The team
   arrives at the Gate and they have their weapons back.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, dial us home!

     HARLAN
     Wait! You--you--you cannot leave! I--I--I cannot leave either! It is
     not safe!

     DANIEL
     What is not safe? Tell us!

     HARLAN
     All in time, there is so much you must know first.

   [The Gate kawooshes and Carter sends the GDO signal.]

     HARLAN

     You will be back! You will! You cannot leave me here..
     all...alone...[He stands staring, worried as the Gate shuts down.)
     Oh, dear!

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [All the members of SG-1 are present, hovering as Dr. Fraiser examines
   O'Neill.]

     FRAISER
     Colonel, how do you feel?

     O'NEILL
     Never felt better in my life! That gets me a little worried
     actually.

     FRAISER

     Yeah, well, this has got me a little worried.
     (Fraiser gives O'Neill her stethoscope.)
     Listen.

   [O'Neill listens to his heart.]

     O'NEILL
     I don't hear anything. What, this is better? I'm dead?!

     FRAISER
     Well, Colonel, to make sense of this I going to have to do a blood
     sample.

   [Fraiser takes a blood sample from O'Neill. A milky white liquid is
   drawn into the syringe.]

     O'NEILL
     My God, what the hell is that? Get that out of me!

     FRAISER
     Look, eh, I'm going to need x-rays on all of them. Stat!

   [In the background, Teal'c begins to rub his abdomen.]

     CARTER
     What did he do to us?

     FRAISER
     I don't know. Just let's everybody stay calm.

   [Teal'c lifts his shirt and he realises that his larval Goa'uld is no
   longer there.]

     TEAL'C
     I no longer possess a Goa'uld.

   [At this, O'Neill grabs a knife, braces his arm against the table, then
   begins to cut open his arm from his wrist to almost his elbow.]

     CARTER
     Colonel! What the hell are you doing?

     FRAISER
     Colonel!

   [Then O'Neill peels back his skin to reveal a mechanical interior of
   circuits and pistons.]

     O'NEILL
     God!

     FRAISER
     Dear God!

   [As Carter helps O'Neill, Fraiser moves away to sound the alarm.]

     FRAISER
     Alert, Security to the Infirmary!

     DANIEL
     Whoa! Security? Doctor Frasier, it is us.

     FRAISER
     Just, don't come any closer.

   [The secutiry team arrives in the infirmary.]

     O'NEILL
     Stand down airmen, just a little misunderstanding. That's an order.

     FRAISER
     Belay that order!

   [General Hammond enters the Infirmary.]

     FRAISER
     General, that is not Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud, General, it's me!

     HAMMOND
     Would you call that human blood?

     FRAISER
     I have reasons to believe that they are all impostors. He, or
     whatever he is, has no detectable heartbeat.

     HAMMOND
     Take them to the holding room. Put a guard outside.

     O'NEILL

     General Hammond.
     (O'Neill gets up and walks over to face Hammond.)
     I don't know what that sonovabitch on 989 did, but I swear to God...

     HAMMOND
     Follow the instructions.

     O'NEILL

     (Interrupting)
     Your wife died of cancer four years ago!

     HAMMOND
     And you will not be hurt!

     O'NEILL
     Your granddaughters' names are Tessa and Kayla!

     HAMMOND
     Any resistance by any of you will be met with deadly force! Is that
     understood?

     O'NEILL
     Understood. Perfectly.

   [O'Neill leads the way out of the Infirmary, followed by the rest of
   his team and the security team.]

   INT--SGC

   [Gen. Hammond and Dr. Fraiser are watching SG-1 via a monitor.]

     HAMMOND
     Looks and sounds like our people. They certainly believe they are
     SG-1.

     FRAISER
     It may be another Goa'uld trick.

     HAMMOND
     I don't know what to believe. He was right about the names of my
     grandchildren. How else would he have known, if he isn't Jack
     O'Neill?

     FRAISER
     Sir, given our history with the Goa'uld, I believe keeping them here
     would be extremely dangerous.

   INT--SGC HOLDING ROOM

   [Daniel is staring in fascination at his right hand.]

     DANIEL
     It's incredible, it looks like mine, it feels like mine, it is mine,
     I mean I don't feel any different. If anything, I feel better!

     CARTER
     Well, that's what Harlan said.

     DANIEL
     Why didn't he just tell us?

     CARTER
     Probably afraid we'd damage him.

     O'NEILL
     Perceptive little runt.

     CARTER
     You know, Colonel, you can't blame General Hammond for confining us.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, I know who I am!

     CARTER
     So do I! In every respect I feel like Carter. But the evidence.
     Harlan must have transferred our consciousness into these bodies!"

   [Teal'c paces the room, holding his abdomen.]

     O'NEILL
     Bodies? Did you see the inside of this arm? We're machines, Carter.

   [Daniel is watching Teal'c pace.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c? Are you okay?

     TEAL'C
     Why?

     DANIEL
     Well...for starters you've lost your...infant Goa'uld.

     TEAL'C
     I still feel its presence.

     DANIEL
     Really? That must be like continuing to feel a limb after it's been
     lost.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud! Daniel! I'm glad you're so fascinated by
     all this, but it's time for a little reality check. Okay? We are
     being help prisoner by our own people.

     DANIEL
     Well, they can't keep us in here forever...I mean....

     O'NEILL
     Why not? What do you think is going to happen? You really think
     military intelligence is going to let us continue as SG-1...like
     this?

     DANIEL
     We still have our rights, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     What rights are you talking about?

     CARTER
     Colonel, no matter what he's done to us, were still.

     O'NEILL

     (Interrupting)
     Human? Is that what you were going to say?

     CARTER
     Harlan said we'd be back. Now we know why.

   [Hammond enters the holding room.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill? Whoever you are. I have decided to send SG-5 back
     to P3X-989. See if they can shed some light on this.

     O'NEILL
     That's a mistake.

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     Because old Harlan will do to them what he did to us.

     HAMMOND
     Harlan?

     DANIEL
     The indigenous person we encountered on the other side, Sir.

     CARTER
     We do believe that he transferred out conciseness into these
     artificial bodies.

     HAMMOND
     Why would anyone do that?

     DANIEL
     Well he thought he was doing us a favour. He thinks this is better.
     And I never even really thought of it at the time, but he must be
     artificial too.

   [Daniel lowers his head, looking exhausted.]

     CARTER
     That must explain how he got to be 11,000 years old.

     HAMMOND
     What?

     O'NEILL

     General?
     (O'Neill is battling exhaustion too, looking as if he might pass
     out.)
     I think that it's imperative that we go back.

   [Each of the team members collapses. Hammond rushes forward to help
   them.]

     HAMMOND
     Get Dr. Fraiser!

     AIRMAN
     Yes, Sir!

   [Carter and Teal'c hold their throats as if they are having difficulty
   breathing while Daniel is holding his head.]

     O'NEILL

     General, we've got to go back.
     (O'Neill grabs Hammond's shoulder in desperation.)

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill and the other members of SG-1 are being helped towards the
   Stargate.]

     HAMMOND
     Will send another team through within the hour!

     O'NEILL
     Negative. Don't risk anymore.

     HAMMOND
     Get this Gate open!

     CHEVRON GUY
     Stand by.

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND: THE STARGATE

   [The four members of SG-1 tumble out of the wormhole and lie before the
   Gate in a state of collapse. They begin to stir, finally sitting up.]

     TEAL'C
     My strength returns.

     CARTER
     We ran out of energy.

     DANIEL
     What?

     CARTER
     Well, if these bodies are machines, they need a power source. It's
     here.

   [We hear Harlan's approach.]

     HARLAN

     Ah! Com-traya! Here is where you belong now. Here is the only place
     you can be.
     (He is chuckling)

   [O'Neill is seething with anger. Suddenly he jumps up, grabs Harlan by
   his collar and throws him against the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     You sonova!

     HARLAN
     You nearly waited too long. I was worried. Feel better?

     O'NEILL
     Better. What the hell did you do to us?

     HARLAN
     You are angry.

     O'NEILL
     Yes. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't break you in half.

     CARTER
     Colonel, he's the only one who can put our consciousness back into
     our real bodies.

     HARLAN
     Oh! No, no, no, I cannot do that. In time you will see, I have
     transferred your consciousness into the synthetic

     O'NEILL

     (Still hold Harlan by his collar, O'Neill yells at him)
     Well transfer us back! Now!

     HARLAN
     No, I cannot, it is permanent.

     O'NEILL

     I do not want to hear that!

     HARLAN
     You are damaging me.

   [Harlan is choking. O'Neill holds him for a few more seconds, then
   finally lets him go.]

     HARLAN
     I am sorry, but there is no way to do what you ask. Your bodies are
     all gone; it is all part of the process. This is what you are now.
     You will see; it is better.

   [SG-1 appears defeated by this news.]

   INT--CORRIDOR IN HARLAN'S COMPOUND

   [The team is following Harlan through the compound.]

     HARLAN
     This way. Around the corner, just a few more steps and home again!

   [They enter the laboratory in which they earlier regained
   consciousness.]

     HARLAN
     You should rest now. Your internal systems are not yet fully
     recharged, and they were aloud to drain far to low.

   [Looking exhausted, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c sit while O'Neill
   continues to seethe.]

     COMPUTER
     Attention, coolant leak in secondary coils in section 2, immediate
     attention is required.

     HARLAN

     Section 2, you see now why I needed you? This place is more then one
     man can maintain! Oh, so much to do. You will see, you will all feel
     much better soon.
     (Harlan leaves the laboratory.)
     Oh, this will not take long at all.

   [O'Neill continues to pace.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, he said we should rest. We don't want to run out of energy
     again.

   [O'Neill ignores him.]

     CARTER
     He's right about this place, half of the stuff of this complex isn't
     working. The rest is marginal. I mean, look around. He's been
     jerry-rigging thing's for centuries. He was desperate.

     O'NEILL
     I say let this place fall down.

     TEAL'C
     To condemn Harlan would be to condemn ourselves.

     O'NEILL
     Your point being?

     TEAL'C
     What is done is done.

     O'NEILL
     Oh please. Has it occurred to anyone that all we are now is robots?

   [O'Neill is upset. Everybody sits in silence his outburst after that.
   O'Neill suddenly walks around and opens the laboratory doors.]

     DANIEL
     Where are you going?

     O'NEILL
     I'm going to find Harlan.

     DANIEL
     Jack!

     O'NEILL
     Don't worry, it's just to talk. Robot to robot.

   [Daniel shakes his head as the doors are closing. Suddenly, a smile
   appears on his face.]

     CARTER
     What?

     DANIEL
     Oh it's nothing. Umm, this notion of living a 11,000 years entered
     my mind for a moment and I couldn't...it's a lot to take in.

     CARTER
     Apparently we've got time to adjust. We really do have all the same
     sensations and perceptions that we did in our human form.

     DANIEL
     Well, if you think about it, the human body is just a machine. It's
     a vessel for our consciousness, I mean, it's just an organic one. I
     mean, it performs work, requires fuel.

   [Carter shakes her head in disagreement.]

     CARTER
     It's not the same, Daniel.

     DANIEL
     No it isn't, but, maybe in away Harlan was right, maybe in away this
     is better. I mean where still us, were still...unique. Every
     thought, every feeling.

     CARTER
     Have you felt hungry, or thirsty since this happened?

     DANIEL
     No!

   [Without warning, Teal'c suddenly stands up and walks to the door.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c?. You still okay?

   [Teal'c doesn't answer and leaves the laboratory. Daniel and Carter
   follow him out but are unable to find him.]

     DANIEL
     Where did he go?

     CARTER

     Probably wants to be alone. I don't blame him.
     (Carter points out the hall in front of them.)
     That way.

   [Cut to Teal'c resting against a wall, holding his abdomen, struggling
   to breathe. He begins to shake violently. Cut to Harlan attempting a
   repair. O'Neill is with him.]

     HARLAN
     I do not understand this obsession of yours.

     O'NEILL
     It's not an obsession. I just wanna know what you did with our
     bodies!

     HARLAN
     But you have no further use for them.

   [Daniel and Carter arrive.]

     HARLAN
     Oh good, you are exploring, yes good, good there is much to see,
     much to learn from the station. And you are feeling better. Yes?

     CARTER
     No. Colonel, have you seen Teal'c?

     O'NEILL
     I left him with you.

     HARLAN
     Perhaps he is best left alone. He is different. Yes?

     O'NEILL
     Yes. Look Harlan, I wanna know why you did this, why you did all of
     this.

   [Harlan is focused on the repair he is making to the pipe.]

     HARLAN
     Our race was facing destruction. The biosphere of this planet could
     no longer support us. This project was undertaken to allow some of
     our people to continue to live, even if our planet could not. Our
     former bodies would never survive this.

     CARTER
     How many were there, originally?

     HARLAN
     A thousand.

     DANIEL
     What happened to them?

     HARLAN
     Oh, there were problems with the transfer process. Some were lost.
     Secara, Bareeth, Tira, very, very sad. We could not repair Hubald,
     creator of all this! His secrets were lost. But many survived...for
     awhile.

     CARTER
     Where are they?

     HARLAN
     Some left through the ring we discovered. The ring, which you went
     through. They carried along small, more portable sources with them.
     I expected them to come home...I waited. This is...home, after all.
     But they...didn't. And the rest did not except the gift,
     they...ended their existence.

     DANIEL
     How?

     HARLAN
     They walked above the surface, far from here, outside of the range
     of the power source. Wallas, he was the last one, he gave his life
     for the station. An accident. And I have been alone since Wallas.
     But you are here now, and everything is better now. Will you hold
     this for me?

   [Daniel goes to help Harlan with the repair.]

     HARLAN

     Com-traya! Very helpful! We work together well. There. See? We
     accomplish things.
     (Harlan puts his tools back in his toolbox and starts to walk away.)
     So we must remain near the power source in case it breaks down
     again. Without the continuous stream of energy from the emitter,
     these bodies could not function for more than a few hours. And that
     is why I knew you would come back.

     O'NEILL
     Harlan, we want to go home.

     HARLAN
     No, no, you must stay, you are friends. New friends.

     O'NEILL
     Friends? I don't even like you. Chances are I will never like you.

     CARTER
     Colonel. If we are ever going to get home, we need him.

     HARLAN

     You still do not appreciate the gift? Immortality, 11,000 going on
     infinity. I always say.
     (An alarm sounds.)
     Oh no!

     COMPUTER
     Attention. Coolant leak.

     HARLAN
     Very bad, very bad.

     CARTER
     What is it?

     HARLAN
     The power source, for us! I spent too much time away from the
     station to create you. Hurry, there's not much time, we must repair
     it or else we will all...die.

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Carter run into the control room with Harlan.]

     HARLAN
     I think the thermos compensator has malfunctioned again. Ah-ha, tube
     18 is lost. It draw heat in from the planetary core, must be vented.
     The surface wind drives irradiated acid rain into the ventilation
     system. It rusts the valves closed.

     CARTER
     So what's keeping us going?

     HARLAN
     Reserve power, like when you went back to your world. "Not much
     time!"

     DANIEL
     Has this ever happened before?

     HARLAN
     Not since Wallas was still alive. That is the reason I created you.
     We must work together.

   [O'Neill starts to randomly push some bottoms. Harlan reacts
   impatiently.]

     HARLAN
     Please help!

   [Daniel and Carter look to O'Neill for approval.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, I'll help. Where's Teal'c? We could use him.

     HARLAN
     It does not matter, he is...different.

     CARTER
     Okay, so what do we do?

     HARLAN

     I had to shut down most of the vents. We have to open more and
     reroute the ventilation.
     (He shows them a map of the building and points out to them the
     places where they should go to open the vents.)
     There and there. I will stay here to operate the computer.

     CARTER
     How do we find these vents, how do we open them?

     HARLAN
     The automatic controls no longer work and the vent are rusted
     closed. You will have to open up the vent shafts, and do it
     manually. Search your minds. It is all there. I made sure of it. You
     have all the answers you need, now go! Go! Go!

   [Daniel and Carter leave, but O'Neill stays with Harlan who shoos him
   away.]

     HARLAN
     Phhtt, phhtt, phhtt!

   [O'Neill slowly departs.]

     HARLAN
     Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

   [Cut to Daniel and Carter walking down the hallway.]

     DANIEL
     This way.

   [Cut to Harlan in the control room.]

     COMPUTER
     Warning, pressure rising to critical levels. Pressure levels at four
     hubald.

   [Cut to O'Neill standing on a footbridge looking down at the lower
   level. He jumps down and walks away looking impressed with his prowess.
   Cut to Harlan looking extremely worried.]

     COMPUTER
     Pressure rising to six hubald units. Warning!

   [Cut to Daniel and Carter arriving at the vent.]

     DANIEL

     There it is.
     (Daniel lifts the vent cover without effort, first surprising then
     impressing them.)
     Did you see that?

     CARTER
     Daniel.

     DANIEL

     Oh.
     (Daniel reaches into the vent.)
     Harlan was right, it's rusted shut, I can feel it.

   [Cut to O'Neill reaching another vent. Cut to Daniel attempting to open
   the valve.]

     DANIEL
     There, I've got it.

   [Cut to Harlan. His computer screen shows that the pressure is
   increasing.]

     COMPUTER
     Warning! Pressure rising to 8 hubald units.

   [Cut to Daniel and Carter, replacing the vent cover. The compound
   begins to shake. Cut to O'Neill trying to free his vent. Cut to the
   control room.]

     COMPUTER
     Pressure rising to 10 hubald units!

   [Harlan makes an adjustment.]

     COMPUTER
     Override venting steam now.

   [Cut to O'Neill at the vent.]

     O'NEILL
     Not yet, Harlan. Not yet!

   [Steam erupts from the vent, pushing O'Neill back. He falls to the
   ground. Teal'c joins him.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c! Thank God! Where have you been?

   [O'Neill attempts to rise but Teal'c pushes him to the ground again.]

     O'NEILL
     Tealc!

   [Teal'c picks up O'Neill and slams him against the wall. Cut to
   Harlan.]

     COMPUTER
     12 hubald units!

   [Cut to Daniel and Carter. Carter is opening another vent. Cut to
   Teal'c, who is attempting to strangle O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c! God, what are you doing?!

   [Cut to Harlan trying to open the vents from the computer system.]

     COMPUTER
     Catastrophic coolant failure is imminent.

   [Cut to Teal'c throwing O'Neill to the floor near some pipes. As
   O'Neill gets up, Teal'c is coming for him.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on! Teal'c, come on! Teal'c!

   [O'Neill swings one of the pipes at Teal'c as hard as he can. The pipe
   bends, shocking O'Neill. Teal'c throws O'Neill down again, O'Neill
   crying out in pain.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

   [Teal'c pushes O'Neill into some pipes, steam erupting from them; cut
   to the control room where the pressure is shown to be descreasing.]

     COMPUTER
     You have succeeded in venting sufficient pressure. Com-traya.

   [Harlan collapses onto his chair. Cut to Daniel and Carter.]

     DANIEL
     We did it.

   [Cut to O'Neill, sitting on the floor. Teal'c grabs him again, focring
   his face into the venting steam. Cut to Daniel and Carter who hear
   O'Neill screaming and rush to his assistance. Cut to Teal'c holding
   O'Neill's face in the venting steam. O'Neill passes out. Teal'c grabs a
   hammer and is poised to hit O'Neill with it as Daniel and Carter
   arrive.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c, don't!

   [Teal'c looks at them without recognition, raising the hammer to strike
   O'Neill. A ray of light hits his abdoment and he disappears. Harlan is
   standing behind where Teal'c was, a laser gun in his hand.]

     CARTER
     Colonel!

   [Carter runs to help O'Neill, who sits, in pain from a terrible wound
   on his cheek baring metal and circuits beneath the synthetic skin which
   was burned away.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm all right.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, but you're not.

     HARLAN
     It is only damage, I can repair it.

   [As O'Neill touches his wound, he gets an electrical chock.]

     HARLAN
     All will be well, you will see. And your friend too.

     CARTER
     What? Teal'c?

     DANIEL
     You killed him!

     HARLAN
     He was malfunctioning.

     DANIEL
     How will all be well with him if he is dead?

   [Harlan absently points his weapon at Daniel, who pushes it away.]

     HARLAN
     You, you will see. Now the station is repaired, go back to your
     quarters and wait. You-you will see.

   [Harlan leaves them.]

     O'NEILL
     Keep an eye on him!

   [Daniel follows Harlan, Carter joining him.]

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND: LABORATORY

   [In pursuit of Harlan,Daniel and Carter arrive at a door then try to
   gain entry.]

     DANIEL
     Harlan, open up!

     CARTER
     Harlan!

   [Daniel and Carter force the door and find Harlan in a laboratory
   beside what appears to be an incubator.]

     HARLAN
     No, no, no! Go away!

     DANIEL
     Harlan, what the hell are you doing?

   [Daniel and Carter see Teal'c inside the incubator.]

     HARLAN
     All will be well. Please, I...

     CARTER

     (Interrupting.)
     He's making a new synthetic Teal'c.

     HARLAN
     Please go back you your quarters, and I will bring him to you
     when...

     CARTER
     How is this possible?

     HARLAN
     Ah--yes, um, there were two minds before, the creature he carried
     within. Two beings. The two minds could not coexist, and your friend
     malfunctioned. I did not know he was different. I will not make that
     mistake this time.

     CARTER
     Answer my question this time. How can you make a new synthetic
     Teal'c, without the original?

   [O'Neill walks into the laboratory.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain Carter. Stand aside. Harlan, turn off that machine.

     HARLAN
     The process is incomplete, I can...

     O'NEILL
     Turn it off!

   [Harlan obeys.]

     O'NEILL
     Now answer the Captain's question.

     HARLAN
     Please if you destroy me, you will destroy the last survivor of an
     entire people, and yourselves too.

     O'NEILL
     I'm going to ask this question once. Do our bodies, our real bodies,
     exist somewhere?

     HARLAN
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Then I want you to put us back. Now.

     HARLAN
     I could not do that, even if I wanted to.

     CARTER
     Why? If you can transfer our conciseness into these bodies, surely
     you can reverse the process?

     HARLAN
     No, it is impossible.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     HARLAN
     I will show you.

   [Harlan leads them into another laboratory, similar to the once in
   which SG-1 awoke.]

     O'NEILL
     My God.

   [We now see the real SG-1 team members, lying down on tables, tape over
   their mouths. O'Neill Robot walks to O'Neill, who is awake, then kneels
   next to him. All the other members of SG-1 seem to be awake too.]

     HARLAN
     I meant no harm. I will return them through the ring as soon as I am
     certain you had accepted your transference.

     ROBOT CARTER
     Except it's not really a transference, is it? From one to the other.
     We're copies.

     HARLAN
     Yes, as good as the original. Better even.

   [Robot O'Neill looks extremely sad.]

     HARLAN
     If you had not been so insistent you would have never seen each
     other. Once I knew the transference was successful. I had intended
     to send your organic selves, back to your world, uh, their world.
     They would never have known of your existence. And in time hope that
     you would have excepted yours.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     We...can never go back.

     HARLAN
     No, you belong here. You are welcome here.

   [Robot Carter walks over to Teal'c and removes the tape from his
   mouth.]

     ROBOT CARTER
     Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Captain Carter.

     ROBOT CARTER
     Colonel, he's all right.

     ROBOT O'NEILL

     (Whispering.)
     That's great, Captain.

   [Robot O'Neill gets up and walks away. Robot Daniel walks over to
   O'Neill and take the tape off his mouth while Harlan frees each member
   of SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     ROBOT DANIEL
     Ah, sort of.

   [Robot Daniel walks over to Daniel. O'Neill and Teal'c sit up and
   watch.]

     ROBOT DANIEL
     Here, let me get that.

   [Robot Daniel sits at Daniel's side then very gently removes the tape
   from his mouth.]

     O'NEILL
     HARLAN, where have you been?

     HARLAN
     Extremely busy.

     O'NEILL
     I can see that. Doing what?

     HARLAN
     Oh, ah, creating your synthetic others. Saving the planet. Busy,
     busy.

   [Robot Carter is sitting next to Carter, who sits up and begins to
   examine her robot. It's clear they are fascinated.]

     O'NEILL
     Synthetic?

     HARLAN
     Yes. I am sorry for restraining you for so long, I am afraid my plan
     has failed rather miserably. But as I promised, you are free to go.

     CARTER
     This is impossible.

     ROBOT CARTER
     It's true. At first we did not even know we had been changed.

     CARTER
     Recreating the neuralstructure on...

     ROBOT CARTER
     I know! Defies the uncertainty principle. We are identical, right
     down to the mole on our...

     CARTER
     Ehhh! Shut up.

     TEAL'C
     Was not a copy made of me?

     HARLAN
     Oh yes, yes. Um, but um, I had to disintegrate you.

     TEAL'C
     I see.

   [He seems offended by this.]

     CARTER
     You get it, you just don't like it.

   [O'Neill walks out.]

     DANIEL
     Ah, well...

   [Everyone is speaking at the same time.]

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND: LABORATORY

   [Robot O'Neill is staring at the incomplete Teal'c synthetic when
   O'Neill walks in behind him.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen, I'm not too happy about this either, you know.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     You think you know how I feel?

     O'NEILL
     Well, yeah. Were basically the same guy, aren't we?

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Ah, have a look.

   [Robot O'Neill angrily shows off his ugly wound.]

     O'NEILL
     Ouch. Sorry.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     So, um, what the hell happened here?

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Somebody stole my life. That's what happened.

     O'NEILL
     You talking about my life?

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Hey, I've got every right to it that you do. I was kind of hoping I
     could figure out away to undo all this, get myself back into my
     body, where I belong.

     O'NEILL
     Well it's occupied, thank you.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     I noticed that. What does that make me? What do you want?

     O'NEILL
     Well they're all debating the meaning of life out there. Both
     Daniels think this is all fascinating. The Carters are arguing
     already. Teal'c feels left out. You and I have go a few things to
     talk about.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     I'm not going to give you a hard time about who gets to go back, if
     that's what you mean.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     It has nothing to do with generosity, believe me. I can't go back.
     If I could it might be a different story.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah well...there is, um, a little issue of security. You know
     everything I know about Earth. Codes, defences.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     We'll bury the Gate, don't worry. And don't even think about trying
     to send a bomb to make sure.

     O'NEILL
     I wasn't.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Yes, you were. I know you.

     O'NEILL
     All right, all right, you have my word, Colonel.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Call me Jack.

     HARLAN
     Colonel O'Neill?

   [He calls for O'Neill off-camera.]

     O'NEILL/ROBOT O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud.

   [The two look at one another.]

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     I'll handle this.

   [Robot O'Neill walks away.]

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND: FOOTBRIDGE

   [O'Neill meets Harlan on the footbridge.]

     HARLAN
     Ah, there you are, I was worried about you. Where is the other one?

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     He is...getting ready to go home.

     HARLAN
     Yes, all for the best. I hope in time you will forgive me.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     You were just trying to survive.

     HARLAN
     Yes, and we will! All will be well, you will see!

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Harlan, people are not supposed to live forever.

     HARLAN
     Maybe not, but if you try just a few hundred years, perhaps you
     might change your mind. Yes?

   [A cheerful Harlan leaves Robot O'Neill alone in his sadness.]

   INT--HARLAN'S COMPOUND: THE STARGATE

   [SG-1 and robot SG-1 gather with Harlan at the Stargate.]

     O'NEILL
     So don't forget to bury the Gate when where gone.

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Like that's something I would forget.

     O'NEILL
     Well.

   [Both O'Neills shake hands.]

     O'NEILL
     See ya. And uh, you should have that looked at, it's...whoa.

   [O'Neill points to the wound on Robot O'Neill's face.]

     ROBOT O'NEILL
     Have a good life.

     O'NEILL
     See ya.

   [Robot Carter and Harlan wave as the real SG-1 team members step
   through the Gate.]
