   TEASER

   EXT--CAL MAH, DAY

   [A crowd of Jaffa, both male and female and ranging in age from
   children to elderly are gathered around listening to Kytano speak in a
   large clearing.]

     KYTANO
     My name is Kytano. The once First Prime of Imhotep. A False God! A
     false god who has died by my own hands. Now, I am free. I am a free
     Jaffa. If you have come to this place, then you wish to know freedom
     as I do. If you've come to hear me, then you know in your heart and
     in your mind that the Goa'uld are not gods.

   [The crowd of Jaffa cheer.]

     KYTANO
     Still, I am but one warrior. Only together, we are an army of
     warriors.

   [The Jaffa cheer again.]

     JAFFA MALE
     An army has weapons! An army has food!

     KYTANO
     In time we shall have weapons, and enough food and drink to sustain
     us for as long as it takes to achieve victory. Until then, we have
     our freedom. We have our brothers...and sisters. I do not say that
     this will be easy. There will be sacrifice. But for each of you who
     dies in the name of freedom, your souls shall be sent to Kheb, the
     place of freedom everlasting. Until then, if you seek freedom, if
     you seek sanctuary, know that this place IS sanctuary, this is Cal
     Mah! I declare this world a free world for all Jaffa! Let no Goa'uld
     challenge us! The time has come for Jaffa to claim their rightful
     place among the stars, as warriors who live and as warriors who
     die...FREE!

   [The crowd cheers. In their midst, Bra'tac and Teal'c, in hooded robes,
   study Kytano and the crowd.]

     BRA'TAC
     What say you, Teal'c?

     KYTANO
     FREE!

     BRA'TAC
     Is he not the means to our deliverance?

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bra'tac and Teal'c, still in their robes, stand and brief the rest of
   SG-1 and Hammond, who are seated at the table.]

     O'NEILL
     Deliverance? Do you have any idea what happened to the guys in that
     movie?

     BRA'TAC
     I do not.

   [Daniel looks up from the report he was reading as Carter shares a
   sidelong bemused look with him. O'Neill merely motions with his hands
   in a "never mind" gesture as his joke fell flat.]

     HAMMOND
     Master Bra'tac, that's a very strong recommendation.

     BRA'TAC
     Yes, it is. Yet the rewards of such an alliance would be great.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Many of our allies have fallen, General Hammond. The Tollan may be
     gone forever, the Tok'ra are severely weakened. Kytano offers an
     army.

     CARTER
     An army that needs our help.

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter, have not the Jaffa helped your cause?

     CARTER
     Teal'c, please, don't misunderstand me. You and Bra'tac have done
     more for us than anyone could have asked. I owe you both my life at
     least a dozen times over. That's not what I'm saying.

     O'NEILL
     What she's saying is if this guy's come to us, he's got to be pretty
     desperate.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute, I don't think we should underestimate this
     opportunity. I mean, an army of Jaffa actually challenging the power
     structure of the Goa'uld. It could be an inspiration to every Jaffa
     out there. Word of its very existence is a threat to the Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     You don't think the Goa'uld are just going to sit around and let it
     happen?

     TEAL'C
     We do not. Which makes Kytano's need so great.

     BRA'TAC
     His army is drawn from many different system lords, and more flock
     to him with each raid he makes. But an army cannot live on courage
     alone.

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Jackson, what can you tell us about this Imhotep? This is the
     first I've heard of him.

     DANIEL
     Well, during the Third Dynasty of ancient Egypt, Imhotep was
     credited as being THE first pyramid builder. He was later deified
     among the ancient Egyptians. But, among the Goa'uld, at least as far
     as I know, he never achieved power of any kind.

     HAMMOND
     He was never a system lord.

     DANIEL
     In fact, I think Imhotep was probably an insignificant Goa'uld from
     a backwater planet.

     CARTER
     Which explains how Kytano has managed to survive.

     O'NEILL
     He took out a nobody.

     DANIEL
     Which probably only buys us some time. If we don't help, the Goa'uld
     will eventually see this as the threat it really is.

     BRA'TAC
     Imhotep may have been a minor Goa'uld, but Kytano is a great leader
     of men. I believe him bold enough to lead his rebel army to victory
     over those who would deny us freedom.

     HAMMOND
     I've already ordered food and medical supplies prepared for
     transport. What we need to discuss in more detail is what kind of
     weapons and how many.

     BRA'TAC
     Your projectile weapons have proven to be effective in battle.

     O'NEILL
     P-90s, MP5s, Spaz 12s.

     BRA'TAC
     For several hundred warriors.

   [O'Neill and Hammond are surprised at the number requested.]

     HAMMOND
     That make take some doing.

     TEAL'C
     General Hammond, if we may send a smaller number of weapons...as a
     gesture of good intentions.

   [Hammond looks to O'Neill for input.]

     O'NEILL
     I think we owe these folks...to a point.

     HAMMOND
     Very well. You have a go.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The gate is dialing. O'Neill joins the rest of his team, Hammond and
   Bra'tac in the gate room. Other military are dragging various equipment
   to a FRED]

     BRA'TAC
     O'Neill, before we leave, you should know that some of the Jaffa you
     are about to meet, you may have met before...in battle.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I've thought about that.

     BRA'TAC
     Jaffa have long memories.

     O'NEILL
     Well that's all right, 'cause I don't.

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac look at each other stone faced as Hammond hides a
   smile.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering)
     It's a...joke.

     HAMMOND
     Master Bra'tac, let's hope your faith in this man is well deserved.

     BRA'TAC
     I would stake my life on it.

   [Bra'tac and Teal'c follow Daniel, Sam and the FRED the wormhole.]

     O'NEILL

     (in an undertone to Hammond)
     Ours too, apparently.

   [He heads up the ramp.]

   EXT--CAL MAH, CLEARING BY STARGATE, DAY

   [A group of warriors are gathered by the Stargate as SG-1 and Bra'tac
   arrive.]

     BRA'TAC
     I am Master Bra'tac, of Chulak. I have come with warriors of the
     Tau'ri.

   [O'Neill unlatches his backpack, and it falls to the ground with an
   audible thump.]

     O'NEILL
     Hi guys.

     BRA'TAC
     Tek ma tek.

   [O'Neill turns to Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     He's saying: "friends well met." He's saying we come in peace.

   [Rak'nor approaches through the crowd of Jaffa.]

     TEAL'C
     Rak'nor.

     RAK'NOR
     Teal'c! Tek ma tek.

   [He grasps Teal'c's forearm, smiling warmly. Teal'c returns the
   greeting.]

     RAKNOR

     (to crowd)
     It was Teal'c who gave me my first taste of freedom!
     (to Teal'c)
     It is because of you I am here. Tek ma te.

     DANIEL
     Tek ma te is a greeting of respect.

     O'NEILL

     (irritated)
     Okay.

     DANIEL
     I'm just saying.

     O'NEILL
     I don't care.

     DANIEL
     Okay.

     RAK'NOR

     These are among the great warriors of the Tau'ri. Daniel Jackson,
     Major Carter, and their leader, Colonel O'Neill.
     (to O'Neill)
     Tek ma tek.

     O'NEILL
     Back at ya.

     RAK'NOR

     (puzzled, but trying to be friendly)
     Back at cha.

   [O'Neill looks nonplussed as Daniel and Carter hide their amusement.]

     RAK'NOR
     You have come to speak with Kytano.

     BRA'TAC
     We have.

     RAK'NOR
     He's on a mission and will return very soon. What is this?

     TEAL'C
     The first shipment of many.

     O'NEILL
     We've brought uh, food, supplies, and last...Carter?

   [Carter opens one of the cases, which are filled with P-90s.]

     O'NEILL
     ...weapons.

   [The Jaffa mutter among themselves and Rak'nor looks disappointed.
   Teal'c and Bra'tac look at their brethren in puzzlement.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     RAK'NOR
     Your gesture is appreciated, but they had hoped you would bring
     staff weapons, zat'nik'tels...true weapons.

     O'NEILL
     "True" weapons?

     RAK'NOR
     It does not matter, friend. Come, see how our numbers are growing.

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, DAY

   [SG-1, Teal'c, and Bra'tac approach the camp with Rak'nor and the
   greeting party. Various Jaffa perform martial arts rituals and spar in
   training circles. Others are having various conversations.]

     JAFFA WOMAN
     Thanks goodness for the alliance.

     JAFFA MAN #2
     Eratica,...

     BRA'TAC
     You see O'Neill? These Jaffa were once sworn mortal enemies, each
     serving different false gods. Now they work in harmony.

     RAK'NOR
     Our numbers grow with each successful campaign.

     CARTER
     And you just trust every new arrival to your cause? Well...I'm just
     saying that isn't it possible some of these Jaffa are still loyal to
     their gods and are acting as spies within your ranks?

     BRA'TAC
     A warrior of Kytano's experience can see within the very soul of
     another Jaffa and know his allegiance.

     O'NEILL
     It's kind of a leap of faith, isn't it?

     DANIEL
     No more than we trusted Bra'tac when Teal'c went through the rite of
     Mal Sharran.

     BRA'TAC
     I saw into his heart, and knew he no longer worshipped Apophis.

     O'NEILL
     That's not...quite the same, is it?

     BRA'TAC
     Our ways are different to you, O'Neill. Accept that.

   [Bra'tac, Teal'c and Rak'nor walk further into the camp. After a moment
   exchanging cautious looks with each other, the rest of SG-1 follows.]

     JAFFA MAN #2
     Bring those baskets around.

   [SG-1, Bra'tac, and Rak'nor approach the training Jaffa. Several are
   performing a very difficult kata of high leaps and kicks and forceful
   arm movements.]

     RAK'NOR
     This discipline is called mastaba. All of Imhotep's Jaffa were
     required to master it. And now we require it of ourselves.

   [They approach a sparring circle. Two Jaffa are finishing a round. One
   helps the other up, and they leave the ring as two other Jaffa approach
   and begin to spar with wooden staff weapons. Teal'c picks up another
   wooden staff from where they are stored.]

     TEAL'C
     Bashaak? Training staffs?

     RAK'NOR
     Out of necessity, Teal'c. There are not enough staff weapons for
     all.

   [The two trade blows at a rapid pace.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to the pair)
     You overcommit.

   [After a moment, the two stop their battle and turn to Bra'tac, bowing
   respectfully.]

     RAK'NOR
     This young warrior's name is Tara'c.

     TARA'C
     Tek ma te, master.

     BRA'TAC

     (holding out his hands)
     If you would allow me.

   [Tara'c hands him the Bashaak, and Bra'tac speaks while performing a
   graceful kata with the staff.]

     BRA'TAC
     The weapon is balanced, but the warrior is not. When one
     overcommits, one becomes vulnerable to counterattack. When one
     achieves balance in combat, one will survive to achieve balance in
     life.

   [He tosses the Bashaak back to Tara'c, who catches it, watching Bra'tac
   in confusion.]

     RAK'NOR
     Forgive me, master, but Kytano teaches that one must strike with
     single-minded purpose towards victory without regard for one's
     survival.

     BRA'TAC

     (intrigued, turning back)
     Show me.

   [The two Jaffa bow, then return to sparring, violently attacking each
   other with the staffs.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, easy, easy, easy.

     BRA'TAC
     Leave them, O'Neill.

   [The two continue to trade blows, Tara'c gaining the upper hand and
   continually striking his competitor in the face with the blunt edge of
   the Bashaak. The Jaffa falls to his knees. Tara'c raises his weapon for
   another blow, but his strike is blocked by the broad side of O'Neill's
   P-90 who holds it protectively in front of him where he stands before
   the fallen warrior.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey! What the hell are you doing!

     TARA'C

     (confused)
     We are training.

     O'NEILL
     Where I come from, that's called beating the crap out of each other!

     TEAL'C
     The boy's symbiote will heal his injuries, O'Neill.

     RAK'NOR
     Kytano teaches that we must be willing to die as he is if we want to
     be free.

     O'NEILL
     Well if you all die, you won't have an army. That's kind of stupid.

   [Tara'c lunges at O'Neill with his Bashaak, waving it in front of
   O'Neill in a hostile manner.]

     TARA'C
     Kek mattet, kree!

     O'NEILL

     (rearing back)
     Wha-what? What?

     TEAL'C

     (smiling and calm)
     You insult our ways, O'Neill. He is challenging you.

     TARA'C

     (menacing the Bashaak in front of O'Neill's face)
     Kek mattet!

     O'NEILL

     (nudging the Bashaak aside with his fingers)
     Yeah, just...easy, stick boy, all right? I'm just here to help.

     JAFFA MALE
     Kytano returns!

   [Tara'c and the others leave the ring and head quickly to the other
   side of camp.]

     O'NEILL
     What? Where you going?

   [All the Jaffa leave. O'Neill checks his breath before leaving the
   ring.]

   [A crowd of Jaffa line the path to camp cheering loudly. SG-1 look
   around curiously. Kytano and his group arrive smiling.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel and Carter)
     You know, we never get this when we come home.

   [Daniel and Carter exchange looks with O'Neill.]

     KYTANO
     Jaffa, this day, three of our warriors have fallen in the name of
     freedom. They fought fiercely against Zipacna's forces. And they
     died bravely and have secured for themselves a place in Kheb. So
     too, have they strengthened our ability to fight back at the enemy.

   [They open a case and show it filled with zat'nik'tels. The Jaffa cheer
   as a zat is raised.]

     O'NEILL

     (scoffing)
     "True weapons."

   [Kytano approaches Bra'tac.]

     KYTANO
     Tek mal tiak.

   [He exchanges a warm forearm grasp with Bra'tac.]

     BRA'TAC

     (bowing slightly)
     Tek ma te.

     KYTANO
     You flatter me, Master Bra'tac.

   [He turns to Teal'c and greets him in the same manner.]

     KYTANO
     Ya duru arik kek onac. I honor he would kill his god. And to his
     brethren of the Tau'ri-slayers of Ra, Hathor, Setesh, Heru'ur,
     Sokar, Chronus, and Apophis.

     O'NEILL
     Well, somebody's been keeping score.

   [Kytano looks at O'Neill, puzzled and wary.]

     O'NEILL
     Colonel Jack O'Neill.

     KYTANO

     (smiling again)
     A familiar name, cursed by every Goa'uld. Imhotep himself declared
     your days were numbered.

     O'NEILL
     Well that's fine. As long as it's a really big number.

     KYTANO

     (chuckling)
     Because of you, the armies of these fallen system lords now swell
     the ranks of our rebellion. We owe you thanks.

     O'NEILL
     Tek ma tek, Kytano.

   [Daniel and Carter look at O'Neill in surprise, and he glances at them
   with a satisfied smile.]

     O'NEILL
     We also offer an alliance.

     KYTANO
     Then you are most welcome.

     DANIEL
     We also offer food and supplies for your people.

     KYTANO
     Glorious!

   [The Jaffa cheer as SG-1 look around in surprise.]

     O'NEILL
     And...of course, weapons!

   [There is a pause as the Jaffa are noticeably silent.]

     KYTANO
     Earth weapons. Take no offense, my friend, but uh your weapons are
     "primitive" by comparison.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, I think a little demonstration is in order, don't you?

   EXT--FIRING RANGE, CAL MAH, DAY

   [The Jaffa gather at the edge of the firing range. By the firing line
   stand SG-1, Rak'nor, Bra'tac and Kytano. One of the P-90 cases rests at
   the firing line. Carter loads a clip into a P-90 with calm assurance.]

     CARTER
     This weapon is called a P-90. It carries a fifty round top-loading
     magazine of teflon coated ordinance with a cyclical rate of fire of
     900 rounds per minute.

     O'NEILL
     Who here can handle a staff weapon?

     KYTANO
     Rak'nor is among our best marksmen.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, that target, what sixty-seventy yards down?

   [He gestures to the other end of the firing range, where three large
   logs hang vertically from ropes under a large wooden frame. Two male
   Jaffa stand near the targets. Carter appraises the distance.]

     CARTER
     Yeah, give or take, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (to Rak'nor)
     Fire away, son.

   [Carter and O'Neill move out of the way. Rak'nor approaches with his
   staff weapon, primes it, aiming carefully, and fires it three times,
   hitting the log twice.]

     KYTANO
     Well done. Ta'i kree.

     O'NEILL
     Two out of three. It's, eh, not bad. Carter?

     KYTANO

     (surprised)
     The female?

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter is a formidable warrior.

     KYTANO
     Yes, of course.

     O'NEILL
     Actually, hold up a second.

   [O'Neill stands next to Carter and gestures to one of the Jaffa at the
   far end of the range.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey you, in the skirt. Get that target swinging a little.

   [The Jaffa pushes the center log so it swings slowly.]

     O'NEILL
     A little more.

   [The Jaffa give a larger heave.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, step away.

   [The Jaffa moves back out of range.]

     O'NEILL

     (low, to Carter)
     When ready, Major.

   [O'Neill slaps Carter warmly on the shoulder and moves back. Carter
   fires the weapon multiple times. The log splinters apart, half of it
   dropping to the ground. Carter turns back to the crowd with a small
   smile. Kytano is shocked and failing miserably to hide it.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, Major, demonstrate the weapon on single shot.

   [Carter adjusts a control on the weapon, turns, and aims again, firing
   once. The rope holding the rest of the log snaps at the bullet's
   impact, and the rest of the log falls to the ground. Carter turns back
   to the Jaffa with a wide smile.]

     O'NEILL

     (raises a staff weapon)
     This is a weapon of terror. It's made to...intimidate the enemy.
     (raises the P-90)
     This is a weapon of war. It's made to...kill your enemy.

     CARTER
     And it's capable of doing so effectively at five times the range I
     just demonstrated.

     O'NEILL
     We've used it to win about every skirmish we've had with the Goa'uld
     and the Jaffa who serve them. Those of you who have gone up against
     us and survived ...and you know who you are...you know what I'm
     talking about.

     KYTANO
     We accept your gifts with gratitude...and humility. Now, let us
     celebrate this new alliance.

   [The Jaffa cheer.]

     O'NEILL
     They really like doing that, don't they?

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, DAY

   INT--TENT

   [SG-1, Kytano, Bra'tac and Rak'nor sit in a circle, eating.]

     KYTANO
     Your weapons are formidable, yes, but they lack the endurance of a
     staff.

     CARTER

     (gesturing with a reloading clip)
     That's what these are for.

     KYTANO

     (skeptically)
     And you will provide them freely?

     DANIEL
     That's the purpose of an alliance, isn't it?

     KYTANO
     It places you in a position of power over us.

     O'NEILL
     How so?

     TEAL'C
     If Kytano does not do exactly as agreed, you may withhold
     ammunition.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, first of all, Teal'c, as long as you're a member of SG-1, you
     should use the pronoun "we", not "you." And secondly, we're not
     holding back. We're offering the best we've got. Now, you can either
     take it...or leave it.

     KYTANO
     Of course, it is only concern for my people that I raise these
     questions.

     O'NEILL
     "Your" people?

     KYTANO
     There is no warrior among us who cannot say "my people."

     TEAL'C
     As I also have done.

     KYTANO
     Colonel O'Neill fears that I may seek power for myself.

     CARTER
     Well, you are gathering an army.

     KYTANO
     And I lead, but there is no warrior among us who cannot claim joma
     secu.

   [O'Neill turns to Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (translating)
     "Challenge of leadership."

     TEAL'C
     To determine the worthiness of the victor, and his right to lead.

     O'NEILL
     To the death, I suppose.

     KYTANO
     Of course.

     O'NEILL

     Of course.
     (pausing)
     Yeah, well, where I come from, we do things...a little differently.

     KYTANO
     And you would have us change our ways to suit yours.

     O'NEILL
     I didn't say that, but if it's not too much trouble...

     BRA'TAC
     Kytano. Colonel O'Neill. It is my hope that we can learn from our
     differences, that they bond us together, make us stronger.

     KYTANO
     Mmm. Your words are wise, Master Bra'tac.

     O'NEILL
     Yes. Wise indeed.

     KYTANO
     Tomorrow we will bond, in battle. You are familiar with the system
     lord, Nirrti?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

     KYTANO
     Tomorrow we're going to raid a supply shipment, intended for a
     battalion of Nirrti's Jaffa. Join us.

     O'NEILL
     If we do, what's in it for us?

     KYTANO
     I see you are one who speaks your mind, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, which is why I don't say much.

     KYTANO
     A share of the spoils.

     O'NEILL
     Spoils are good. We like spoils.

     KYTANO

     (nodding)
     Teal'c has informed me that you require several hours of sleep.
     There is no shame in doing so.

   [Kytano rises and leaves the tent.]

     O'NEILL
     Gee, thanks.

   INT--RAK'NOR'S TENT

   [Teal'c, Rak'nor, and other Jaffa are eating and drinking. Teal'c lets
   out a hearty laugh, fully enjoying himself among his companions.]

     TEAL'C

     (toasting his cup)
     Shal met.

     RAK'NOR
     Shal met. Have you chosen to join us, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Kytano has yet to ask.

     RAK'NOR
     He will. You will take your place as a leader in the Jaffa nation.

     TEAL'C
     I have long dreamed Jaffa would one day be free, but I fear that day
     is farther off than Kytano believes.

     RAK'NOR
     We have come so far because of you, Teal'c. Kytano could not have
     hoped to raise such an army had you not led the way.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps.

     RAK'NOR
     And we will grow even stronger, now that the Tau'ri have become our
     allies.

     TEAL'C
     Of that I am not so sure. Kytano's ways are difficult for the people
     of the Tau'ri to understand.

   [From behind Teal'c, Kytano enters the tent. He has heard Teal'c's last
   comment.]

     KYTANO
     We shall gain our freedom, with or without them.

   [Teal'c gets to his feet and bows his head before Kytano.]

     TEAL'C
     Kytano. Forgive me.

     KYTANO
     There is nothing to forgive.

     TEAL'C
     I do not speak for O'Neill.

     KYTANO
     What you say is true. They are different, cynical of our ways,
     O'Neill most of all.

     TEAL'C
     Yet they are my friends.

     KYTANO
     And we are your brothers. I am not a fool, Teal'c. I know the Tau'ri
     are strong. An alliance can make us stronger, but I abandon nothing
     of who and what we are, for neither human nor Goa'uld.

   [Teal'c considers this and bows his head.]

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT

   INT--SG-1'S TENT

   [Daniel is stretched out on top of his sleeping bag, writing in his
   journal. O'Neill unlaces his boots and Carter drops her pack before
   sitting on her sleeping bag. They all surround a central fire.]

     O'NEILL
     I guess Teal'c's staying out all night with his new buddies.

     DANIEL
     Well, he did get in all that quality "kel'no'reeming."

     O'NEILL
     What do you think?

     CARTER
     Of Kytano? Well, you have to admit he's got presence, and his
     followers are almost fanatical.

     O'NEILL
     Almost?

     DANIEL
     Well, it does make them formidable. Ancient Japanese feudal lords
     recognized the discipline that incorporated indifference to death as
     a very effective tool in battle.

     O'NEILL
     And what's with this jomo sicko thing?

     DANIEL
     Joma secu.

     O'NEILL
     Like anybody in that crowd's going to challenge him.

     CARTER
     Kytano's managed to collect Jaffa from at least six different system
     lords. He must be doing something right.

     O'NEILL
     Well, they have no problem with dying. I have a problem with that.

     DANIEL
     You have a problem with dying, or you've got a problem with the fact
     that they don't have a problem with it?

     O'NEILL
     Both, I think.

   [He stretches out on his sleeping bag. Carter lies down as well and
   covers herself with her sleeping bag.]

     O'NEILL
     Get some sleep. We have to "bond" in the morning.

   EXT--NIRRTI'S PLANET, DAY

   [A cargo ship is parked on a planet. The sky is an orangish red tint.
   In the distance a group of Nirrti's Jaffa approach the ship, carrying
   supplies.]

   [SG-1 and Kytano's forces lie in wait, ready to ambush the Nirrti's
   Jaffa. When their quarry reach a certain point on the trail, Kytano
   calls out to them.]

     KYTANO
     Kree! You are surrounded! Relinquish your weapons!

   [Nirrti's Jaffa do not respond, but instead crouch down in what little
   shelter they can find and ready their weapons. Kytano signals one of
   his Jaffa, who takes aim with a P-90 and fires at Nirrti's Jaffa. A
   firefight ensues between both sides. After a couple minutes of this,
   Kytano rises to his feet and walks unarmed towards Nirrti's Jaffa,
   somehow not being hit by the crossfire. Teal'c watches him in
   amazement; O'Neill watches him incredulously.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey!

     RAK'NOR
     He does not know fear.

     O'NEILL
     Well, he knows stupid!

     KYTANO
     Hal mek! Hold your fire.

   [Both sides cease fire.]

     KYTANO
     I am Kytano. If you have heard that name, then you know that there
     are other Jaffa who believe that the Goa'uld are false gods. Join us
     in the struggle against our oppressors, and live to seek freedom.

   [Nirrti's lead Jaffa rises and approaches Kytano, his staff weapon
   raised and primed. Kytano steps closer, his breastplate pressing
   against the staff weapon with a clank.]

     KYTANO

     (defiantly)
     If you do not believe in freedom for our people, brother...then
     shoot me now.

   [He raises his arms out on either side of him in surrender. After a few
   moments of contemplation, the head Jaffa backs down, lowering his staff
   weapon. Kytano reaches forward and clasps him on the shoulder. Kytano's
   rebel Jaffa rise and cheer.]

     TEAL'C
     Do you believe in him now, O'Neill?

   [O'Neill watches the celebration cautiously.]

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, DAY

   [The Jaffa march victoriously back into camp with their spoils,
   whooping in celebration. Teal'c too raises his hands in triumph.
   O'Neill walks and watches them all. He pauses and motions to Teal'c as
   other Jaffa call to each other.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c. Um...

     JAFFA FEMALE
     There are plenty more.

     JAFFA MALE #2
     It's okay, friend. You may use that.

     JAFFA FEMALE #2
     Victorious, they returned with supplies.

     O'NEILL
     Listen, I'm a little concerned about Kytano.

     TEAL'C
     Explain.

     O'NEILL
     Well, you know that stunt he just pulled.

     TEAL'C
     Kytano is driven by the power of his beliefs.

     O'NEILL
     His beliefs are very impressive, but his tactics could have gotten
     us all killed.

     TEAL'C
     Kytano was successful.

     O'NEILL
     I say he got lucky.

     TEAL'C

     (angry)
     Then it appears we disagree.
     (A horn blows)
     Kytano summons us.

   [Teal'c runs off. O'Neill looks upset as Carter and Daniel approach.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     We've got a problem with Teal'c. He's buying into Kytano's act.

     CARTER
     Well, you don't really think it's an act, do you? I mean, Kytano
     certainly believes in this cause.

     O'NEILL
     I think Kytano believes he can walk on water.

   [O'Neill walks off. After a moment, Carter and Daniel follow, serious
   expressions clouding their faces.]

   INT--TENT

   [The Jaffa, still flush with victory, enter the tent, SG-1 following.
   Kytano opens a chest to discover a large supply of staff weapons. A
   second trunk reveals small bars of weapons grade naquadah.]

     KYTANO
     The fruits of our newborn alliance.

     RAK'NOR
     The cutting edge that is the sword of our rebellion.

     CARTER
     Weapons grade naquadah, sir. A lot of it.

     O'NEILL
     That's quite a haul.

     KYTANO
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     What are you going to do with it?

     KYTANO
     I will give you as much as is fair. I have plans for the rest. As
     for the zat'nik'tels, we require them all. I will be able to offer
     you many times as much once the ha'tak arrives.

     DANIEL

     (incredulous)
     You're expecting a mothership?

     KYTANO
     You chose your allies well. I've just received news that Jaffa,
     loyal to me, are staging a mutiny, as we speak, aboard a powerful
     mothership. Soon they will be on their way and unite with us in our
     cause.

     O'NEILL
     A mutiny? That's...a little risky, isn't it?

     KYTANO
     There are always risks in war.

     O'NEILL
     But if they fail, they...

     KYTANO
     They will succeed because their cause is just.

     O'NEILL
     I wish it worked that way.

     KYTANO
     Then they will succeed with the strength of their resolve. Come with
     me to the Chappa'ai. See for yourself. Come.

   [Kytano and other Jaffa exit the tent.]

   EXT--CLEARING BY STARGATE, CAL MAH, DAY

   [Jaffa stand in formation near the stargate. Kytano stands by the DHD,
   dialing. He pauses before activating the stargate. SG-1 stands nearby,
   watching.]

     KYTANO
     Nirrti must not learn of our raid. She would surely hunt us down. We
     must cover our tracks.

   [He approaches Tara'c, who stands at the forefront of a group of Jaffa,
   a strange boxlike device strapped to his chest.]

     KYTANO
     Tara'c, I chose you to lead this squad of brave warriors, because I
     know you will not fail me.

   [Tara'c nods solemnly. Kytano steps back and addresses the Jaffa.]

     KYTANO
     Know that if you are struck down in battle, you will live forever in
     Kheb, free from Goa'uld oppression for all time.

   [A large group of the Jaffa break off and line up before the stargate
   like an honor guard. Another Jaffa opens the case of naquadah, and
   places two small amounts of the element in the cover Kytano holds in
   his hand. Kytano replaces the cover on the box attached to Tara'c's
   chest.]

     KYTANO
     Fight your way as deeply as you can into Nirrti's force. Show them
     your resolve. Kalach shal tek!

     TARA'C
     Kalach shal tek!

   [O'Neill turns to Daniel, mouthing what?]

     DANIEL

     (translating)
     "Victory or death."

     CARTER

     (watching, concerned)
     Sir, that's a naquadah enhanced bomb.

     DANIEL

     (concerned)
     He's sending them on a suicide mission.

     TARA'C
     Jaffa, Kree!

     O'NEILL
     Guys, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Hold on!

   [Rak'nor blocks O'Neill from approaching, and the colonel's cries go
   unheard as Tara'c and his squad jog determinedly through the stargate
   with warrior cries.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell are you doing!?!

     KYTANO
     Do you now see the strength of our resolve?

     O'NEILL
     I see the strength of your arrogance!

     KYTANO
     Do not interfere with things you know nothing about.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, I know EXACTLY what you're about.

     KYTANO
     We are at war. It is our way.

     O'NEILL
     And I suppose it makes you feel all powerful to know how eager those
     boys are to die for you.

     KYTANO
     Their souls are on their way to a far better place.

     O'NEILL
     You know, I've heard that before.

     KYTANO
     You would deny the existence of Kheb? You would deny that their
     souls would find paradise.

     DANIEL
     I think what Col. O'Neill is trying to say is that we do things a
     little differently.

     KYTANO
     Yet again, you remind me your ways are different. We should abandon
     centuries of Jaffa tradition and follow the ways of the Tau'ri.
     Which of us is arrogant?

     DANIEL
     Look, if we're going to have an alliance here, we have to find a
     common ground.

     KYTANO
     Soon the ha'tak we await will come, and this army will be a true
     force to be reckoned with. If you wish to ally yourselves with that
     force, then accept us for who and what we are. If not, then leave us
     now. Teal'c.

   [Bra'tac exchanges serious looks with O'Neill as he follows Kytano and
   the other Jaffa back to camp. After a long look at O'Neill, Teal'c
   joins Bra'tac in walking with the other Jaffa.]

   INT--KYTANO'S TENT

   [Kytano, Bra'tac, Teal'c, and Rak'nor study a map on parchment. Kytano
   points out spots on the map with his knife blade.]

     KYTANO
     Expect resistance here and here.

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson witnessed the system lord Yu being stabbed by Osiris.

     KYTANO
     Mmm. With his sarcophagus, he survived. Still, he was severely
     weakened by the attack. His homeworld is ripe for the taking if his
     personal guard can be eliminated. Now is the time when Lord Yu will
     be most vulnerable.

     BRA'TAC
     Well then, now is the time to strike.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     KYTANO
     I have several loyal Jaffa among his court. Many of his Jaffa would
     join us if he were to be struck down.

     TEAL'C
     And we would be able to commandeer his fleet.

     BRA'TAC
     Ships filled with Jaffa ready to flock to our cause. I have dreamed
     of it, but I never thought it possible.

   [O'Neill enters the tent.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c? We're packing up. I'd like you to come with us.

   [Teal'c begins to move forward, but Kytano speaks.]

     KYTANO
     His place is here.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

   [Teal'c steps forward.]

     TEAL'C
     Kytano has entrusted me with a mission of great importance.

     O'NEILL
     I'll bet he has.

     TEAL'C
     I have accepted this mission freely.

     O'NEILL
     Don't do it.

   [Kytano and Bra'tac watch this exchange with interest, but remain
   silent.]

     TEAL'C

     Lord Yu's stargate will be unguarded. The plan is bold enough to
     succeed, O'Neill.
     (places his hand on O'Neill's shoulder)
     More so if you join us.

     O'NEILL
     Can't do it.

   [Teal'c smiles in disappointment and bows his head before turning to
   Kytano.]

   EXT--CLEARING BY STARGATE, CAL MAH, DAY

   [An honor guard of Jaffa line the path to the stargate as Kytano,
   Teal'c, and Rak'nor approach.]

     O'NEILL
     Why him?

   [They turn and face O'Neill, who's approaching them from behind. Carter
   and Daniel are behind O'Neill, both looking very upset.]

     KYTANO
     Teal'c's participation will guarantee the success of this mission.

     O'NEILL
     On the other hand, Teal'c is a leader in his own right. You might
     not want him around.

     KYTANO
     Teal'c will become one of our greatest warriors.

     O'NEILL
     If he lives.

     KYTANO
     He will succeed.

     O'NEILL
     Because you say so?

     KYTANO
     Because he is Teal'c.

     O'NEILL
     All right, so let me see if I've got this straight. You assassinate
     one system lord after another, you take all their ships and
     warriors--all of whom are willing to die for you--and this is
     different than the way things are now...how?

     KYTANO
     The Jaffa will be free.

     O'NEILL
     To follow you.

     KYTANO

     (shaking his head)
     I grow tired of this. It is time!

   [Kytano heads towards the stargate. Teal'c turns to follow. Daniel and
   Carter both sigh in frustration as O'Neill stews for a moment, then
   approaches Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

   [Teal'c turns back to face his friend. Bra'tac is just behind him, able
   to hear every word. Kytano is at the far end of the formation, speaking
   in a low tone. Someone dials the stargate.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm not going to recommend an alliance. Not as long as he's in
     charge.

     TEAL'C

     (speaking low)
     We will speak of this when I return, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     I don't think so. Because if you do this, I don't think you're
     coming back.

     TEAL'C

     (slightly louder)
     When I return victorious, will you reconsider?

     O'NEILL
     Tough call.

     TEAL'C
     Trust in me, O'Neill. All of you.

   [The stargate activates, and the formation of Jaffa walk up the steps
   as other Jaffa break off and step through it. Kytano approaches
   Teal'c.]

     KYTANO
     Teal'c, you are strong, and you are wise. Upon your return, you
     shall be my second in command.

   [Teal'c salutes Kytano, who returns the gesture. More Jaffa pass the
   honor guard and jog through the stargate. Teal'c takes his staff weapon
   from Bra'tac and joins them. The rest of SG-1 watch silently in alarm.
   Teal'c looks at them for a moment with a serious, inscrutable
   expression, then jogs through the stargate with a determined gait.]

   EXT--LORD YU'S HOMEWORLD, DAY

   INT--LORD YU'S COURT

   [Yu stands before his throne. Some Jaffa enter, dragging Teal'c between
   them. He is unable to stand or walk and is being dragged on his knees.
   He is chained and manacled, a bar locking his elbows behind his back
   and attached to a shackle around his neck. Teal'c's face is cut and
   bruised. He tries to stare defiantly at Yu, but looks very weary.]

     YU
     Teal'c. Perhaps I am not as weak as you were led to believe. My
     Jaffa have brought you before me because I wanted it so. Kytano has
     sent you to kill me.

   [Teal'c barely nods, remaining silent.]

     YU
     Your faith is not blind. I know this of you. I am going to offer you
     your life. I will even allow you to return to your "rebel army." But
     first, there is something you must know.

   [Teal'c looks at Yu with interest.]

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, DAY

   [Bra'tac walks next to O'Neill, Carter and Daniel follow immediately
   behind. The three members of SG-1 are carrying their gear and heading
   towards the stargate.]

     BRA'TAC
     O'Neill. Will you not reconsider?

   [Kytano approaches from the other direction.]

     KYTANO
     As Bra'tac said, we are stronger together. Can we put aside our
     petty differences?

     O'NEILL
     I'm holding you personally responsible for whatever happens to
     Teal'c. Carter, dial us out of here.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [The three keep walking. Kytano walks towards the camp and Bra'tac
   watches the humans depart.]

   EXT--CLEARING BY STARGATE, DAY

   [Carter dials the DHD. As she reaches for the seventh symbol, a
   wormhole forms.]

     CARTER
     Incoming, sir!

   [She dives below the DHD, readying her P-90. O'Neill and Daniel crouch
   as well, readying their own weapons. Out of the wormhole runs Teal'c,
   alone and unarmed.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c!

     DANIEL
     What happened!?!

   [Teal'c immediately runs along a side path towards the camp, either not
   noticing or ignoring his teammates.]

     O'NEILL
     Thanks for the update.

   [The three run after Teal'c.]

   EXT--CAL MAH ENCAMPMENT, DAY

   [Jaffa go about their training and everyday activities as Teal'c runs
   into the camp. The rest of SG-1 also rush in, watching him. Kytano is
   working with a Bashaak.]

     TEAL'C
     Deceiver! We have been deceived! Deceiver!

   [Teal'c is brought up short by two Jaffa warriors before he can reach
   Kytano. They keep him restrained by his upper arms.]

     KYTANO
     I have deceived no one. The ha'tak I spoke of is just now entering
     the system. When it arrives, all will become clear.

     TEAL'C
     Lord Yu knows Cal Mah is the location of this rebel army. He knows
     our numbers. He knows you have betrayed him. The mutiny on board
     Lord Yu's ship has failed. The ha'tak you await brings doom, not
     salvation. The system lords merely bided their time to root out all
     rebel Jaffa, so that they may be crushed in one all-out attack! The
     betrayer has been betrayed.

   [All the Jaffa have stopped their activities and look at Teal'c in
   amazement. Daniel and Carter watch in concern. Kytano turns away in
   disbelief.]

     TEAL'C
     Joma secu.

     KYTANO

     (stopping, incredulous)
     You challenge me?

     TEAL'C
     JOMA SECU!

     KYTANO
     Very well.

   [He grabs another Bashaak and tosses it to Teal'c. The Jaffa release
   him as he catches it with one hand.]

   [The battle is joined, Kytano strikes and kicks in the mastaba manner,
   gaining the advantage of Teal'c, who is still bleeding from his torture
   under Yu. O'Neill winces as Teal'c falters, and the colonel adjusts his
   grip on his weapon, but Bra'tac stays his hand.]

     BRA'TAC
     If you intervene, the challenge will be forfeit.

   [Teal'c strikes wildly a few times with his staff, but Kytano easily
   dodges the wide swings before kicking Teal'c's legs out from under him.
   Both jump immediately to their feet.]

     KYTANO
     Perhaps you think I will spare you.

     TEAL'C
     This is a fight to the death, your death.

     KYTANO
     Shol'va!

   [Teal'c swings again, but Kytano again dodges, instead flipping and
   kicking Teal'c in the face twice, knocking him back further with two
   blows from his staff. O'Neill and Daniel wince and look away for a
   moment as Carter watches with rising concern.]

     KYTANO

     (chuckling)
     Is that the best you can do?

   [Teal'c looks up from where he is crouched on one knee. After a pause,
   Kytano again moves to attack. Teal'c rises and holds his Bashaak
   horizontally in front of him to block the blow from Kytano's weapon.
   The force of Kytano's strike breaks Teal'c's staff in half and knocks
   Teal'c in the shoulder, dropping him once again to his knees. Carter
   and O'Neill both wince while Daniel watches wide-eyed in alarm.]

   [Kytano twirls his weapon expertly behind his back and brings it
   forward, knocking Teal'c in the face where he remains on one knee,
   spitting out blood.]

     KYTANO
     Beg for mercy.

   [Teal'c glares as he wipes blood from his lip.]

     TEAL'C
     I die free!

   [Kytano steps forward and leans close to Teal'c ear, so only he can
   hear him.]

     KYTANO

     You die at the hand of your god...
     (in Goa'uld echo)
     Imhotep.

   [Teal'c tries to catch his breath as he processes this shocking
   revelation. Kytano/Imhotep steps back to his position, then moves to
   strike with his Bashaak. As he moves forward, Teal'c raises the broken
   edge of his staff in front of him, piercing his opponent as if it were
   a spear. Kytano/Imhotep drops his weapon and grabs at the staff
   impaling him, which Teal'c holds there with all his strength. Finally
   the Kytano/Imhotep falters, his eyes glowing before he collapses to the
   ground, dead.]

   [Rak'nor and Bra'tac move forward. Rak'nor exposes the imposter's
   abdomen, which is perfectly smooth with no Jaffa scar.]

     RAK'NOR
     He is not Jaffa. Kytano is not Jaffa!

     TEAL'C

     (weakly)
     He was a Goa'uld, the Goa'uld Imhotep.

     DANIEL
     He used the Jaffa's desire for freedom against them. It was probably
     the only way he could gain any real power.

   [Bra'tac helps Teal'c to his feet, holding him upright.]

     TEAL'C

     (voice breaking from fatigue and emotion)
     Kytano was a lie. What brought us to Cal Mah is not. Lord Yu's ship
     will attack at any moment. Follow us. Leave with us if you wish to
     live.

     BRA'TAC
     Follow Teal'c. He speaks the truth.

     RAK'NOR
     And he has won the right. You all witnessed. Kytano has been beaten
     in the rite of joma secu. Teal'c is our rightful leader now.

   [Blasts rock the camp from a ship in orbit.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     Way ahead of you, sir.

   [Daniel and Carter head towards the stargate. More weapons fire blasts
   through the camp.]

     TEAL'C
     Leave with us. Leave with us if you wish to live!

   [The Jaffa hurry to escape, crowding the path as weapons fire follows
   them all the way.]

     JAFFA MALE #1
     Run! Run!

     JAFFA MALE #2
     Hurry, hurry everybody.

     JAFFA FEMALE #1
     Help us!

   EXT--CLEARING BY STARGATE, CAL MAH, DAY

   [Carter finishes dialing the stargate and joins Daniel by it. He steps
   through first leading the Jaffa. Carter guides the Jaffa until O'Neill
   approaches, then steps through herself.]

     JAFFA FEMALE #2
     Go, go!

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, let's go!

   [O'Neill helps some of the Jaffa mount the steps. Behind him, Teal'c
   moves forward, still supported by Bra'tac. They pause and watch as the
   encampment is destroyed.]

     BRA'TAC
     Our time will come, old friend, but not this day.

   [Teal'c looks at Bra'tac and nods weakly. They head through the
   stargate.]

   FADE OUT
