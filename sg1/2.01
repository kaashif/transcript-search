   INT--KLOREL'S MOTHERSHIP

     O'NEILL
     Captain Carter?

     CARTER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     Were you able to put enough C4 around this ship to make a dent?

     CARTER
     We placed charges where they should generate secondary explosions,
     so, yes, sir. Should make a hell of a dent.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Captain.

     CARTER
     Given enough time, I might be able to figure out...

     O'NEILL
     Negative. We should expect some of their reinforcements through that
     door any second. Stand by to detonate your charges on my order.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     DANIEL
     Wait!

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, if we don't stop them now, we may never stop them.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I know that.

   [Daniel takes a pack of C4 from his vest and attaches it to the
   peltak.]

     DANIEL
     Let's just make as big a dent as possible, okay?

     CARTER
     Ready and awaiting your order, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Well, I suppose now is the time for me to say something
     profound.

   [He pauses and thinks.]

     O'NEILL
     Nothing comes to mind. Let's do it.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, Apophis's ship approaches.

     DANIEL
     We overheard in the Gate room he said he would rejoin Klorel once
     they came out of the shadows.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, if we can knock out this ship, will it stop them?

     TEAL'C
     It will not. Apophis's vessel is equipped with defence shields. He
     will still be able to destroy your cities from high above.

   [There is the sound of banging as Jaffa try to break through the
   doors.]

     O'NEILL
     Tell me those C4 charges are on automatic timer.

     CARTER
     They're on automatic timer.

     O'NEILL
     Good. How long do we have?

     CARTER
     Twenty-four hours.

     O'NEILL
     Twenty-four hours?

     CARTER
     At the time, sir, I thought we were still light-years away.

   [More sounds of banging on the doors.]

     O'NEILL
     Just a minute! Teal'c, work with me, buddy, is there any other way
     out of here?

     TEAL'C
     None.

   [The Jaffa are starting to get the doors open.]

     O'NEILL

     Cover up.
     (they take cover)
     This is turning out to be a bad day.

   [There is a firefight with the Jaffa, until a metal ball is thrown into
   the room. It explodes in a bright light. SG-1 collapse unconscious.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill?

   [O'Neill's hand feels Teal'c's cheek.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c. Ahh! Teal'c. I can't see!

     TEAL'C
     I am blinded as well. It will pass.

     O'NEILL
     What the hell was that?

     TEAL'C
     A Goa'uld shock grenade. Though extremely painful, its effects are
     temporary.

     O'NEILL
     That's good to hear.

   [O'Neill feels behind him, accidentally colliding with Carter's head.
   She bites him on the hand.]

     O'NEILL
     Ow--God--ow!

     CARTER
     Colonel? Sorry, sir. It's just so dark.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, it's all right. I like your attitude.

     DANIEL
     It isn't dark. We're blind. And we failed.

     O'NEILL
     All right, take it easy, Daniel. We've been in worse situations than
     this.

     TEAL'C
     Not to my knowledge.

     O'NEILL
     Thanks, Teal'c.

     DANIEL
     Right now they're getting ready to wipe out the major cities of
     Earth. They'll do it from orbit, out of reach.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel...

     DANIEL
     Jack, I've already been through this once before. I've already seen
     this before.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, will you relax? You've been through it before, and you
     survived. We're just having a bad day.

     CARTER
     Colonel, I think I'm starting to see something.

     TEAL'C
     My sight returns as well.

     O'NEILL
     Now, that's what I want to hear. Carter, if someone comes in here,
     you bite 'em in the hand!

     CARTER
     Yes, sir!

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [Klorel's body is lowered into the sarcophagus. A Jaffa turns to
   another Jaffa whose face is hidden by full armour. Bra'tac's voice is
   heard. Bra'tac speaks angrily to the Jaffa in Goa'uld.]

     BRA'TAC
     Tal kree shak! Pikta. Cha Kree ta.

     JAFFA
     Forgive me, Master. I will not fail Klorel again.

     BRA'TAC
     No, you will not.

   [Bra'tac zats the Jaffa twice.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond enters. He is wearing battledress.]

     HAMMOND
     What the hell are you doing here?

     SAMUELS
     Reporting for duty, sir. I'm to co-ordinate with the Pentagon.

     HAMMOND
     By whose order?

     SAMUELS
     The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. At the request of Senator Kinsey.
     He did try to contact you.

     HAMMOND
     Maybe you can tell me why our forces haven't gone on full alert? If
     we don't get our assets moving now, they are going to be caught on
     the ground.

     SAMUELS
     The current thinking at the Pentagon is to do nothing that would
     alert the Goa'uld we know they're there.

     HAMMOND
     Let me guess whose bright idea that was!

     SAMUELS
     General Hammond, may I speak freely? I know I seem to have lost your
     respect, sir, for whatever reason, but we wouldn't be in this
     situation, that is, at the brink of war with the Goa'uld, if you had
     heeded my advice and buried the Stargate in the first place.

     HAMMOND
     Was that "I told you so," Colonel Samuels?

     SAMUELS
     I'm not here to point fingers, sir. I'm here to help co-ordinate our
     pre-emptive strike against Goa'uld ships. That's if the President
     approves. The Joint Chiefs are briefing him now.

     HAMMOND
     And with what do you intend to strike?

     SAMUELS
     A new weapon, sir. I've helped to oversee its development at Area 51
     with Colonel Maybourne. Two prototypes are being prepared for launch
     at Vandenberg Air Force Base as we speak. If all goes well, history
     shall mark this day by two brilliant and unexplained flashes that
     occur in the night sky. The world should never know how close we
     came to Armageddon.

   INT--APOPHIS'S MOTHERSHIP

   [Bra'tac rings onto the ship.]

     APOPHIS
     Kel Klorel?

     BRA'TAC
     Your son was struck down by the humans on Klorel's vessel.

     APOPHIS
     He has been placed in his sarcophagus?

     BRA'TAC
     Yes, my Lord, but his wounds were great. It will take time to revive
     him.

     APOPHIS
     What of the humans?

     BRA'TAC
     I thought to wait until Klorel...

     APOPHIS
     No! Execute them now!

     BRA'TAC
     I will see to it myself.

   [Bra'tac exits via the transport rings.]

   [Apophis is at the controls of his mothership with a Jaffa.]

     JAFFA
     We hold our position. The humans of this world still send no
     challenge.

     APOPHIS
     Yet they find their way to my son. We will attack their world when
     Klorel has risen again. They will pay a hundredfold for their
     insolence.

     JAFFA
     Kel sha, Apophis.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     SAMUELS
     The Goa'uld's unexplained delay is buying us the necessary time to
     prepare. We'll launch a strike as soon as they enter orbit.

     HAMMOND
     What makes this weapon of yours so special?

     SAMUELS
     An otherwise ordinary Mark 12A warhead has been enriched by the
     alien material, naquadah.

     HAMMOND
     The Stargate element?

     SAMUELS
     Yes, sir. As you know, a small amount of the raw ore was found by
     SG-5 and brought back some months ago. The warheads should now yield
     in excess of 1000 megatons--each. We call them our Goa'uld-busters.
     Our plan is to launch two rockets simultaneously into retrograde
     orbit. Now, the naquadah-enriched warheads themselves are made of
     the same material as our stealth aircraft and should go undetected
     by their radar.

     HAMMOND
     Assuming the Goa'uld have anything remotely like radar!

     SAMUELS
     It's our best shot, sir. And I'm sure the President agrees or he
     wouldn't have initiated countdown. Currently we stand at T minus 3
     hours. We'll hold at two minutes while the Goa'uld come within
     range. It's going to work, sir. The Goa'uld should be taken
     completely off guard.

     HAMMOND
     If you're wrong, every country on Earth will be caught off guard. If
     it were up to me, I'd strongly recommend warning...

     SAMUELS
     With respect, sir, it's not up to you.

   INT--CELL ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     DANIEL
     Well, on the bright side, my hand isn't blurry any more.

   [There is the sound of footsteps approaching.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

   [A Serpent Guard is outside the cell. O'Neill and Teal'c position
   themselves either side of the door. The Serpent Guard enters--it is
   Bra'tac.]

     O'NEILL
     Bra'tac?

   [Bra'tac hits O'Neill. O'Neill collapses.]

     BRA'TAC
     Fools! Hashak! You doom yourselves. It is all I can do to keep you
     alive. Do you know all I have done to regain the trust of Apophis
     and join this campaign? Hm? Hm?

     TEAL'C
     Tek ma te, Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     Hello again, old friend. Your son grows strong. One day he will be a
     great warrior. But you should not have come.

     TEAL'C
     I stand by my friends. I believe this world may be our only hope in
     one day overcoming the false gods.

     BRA'TAC
     Yes. As pathetic as that may seem at the moment, I agree.

     DANIEL
     You do?

     BRA'TAC
     I may even have been able to save this world had you not interfered.

     O'NEILL
     Hey! What do you think we've been trying to do? It is our world
     you're talking about here.

     BRA'TAC
     Enough, human! This is not the place to talk of these things. I have
     been ordered by Apophis himself to execute you--an order I intend to
     disregard. Come!

   [SG-1 follow Bra'tac from the cell.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   [A truck enters via the main gate.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond is studying a computer screen showing the two motherships.]

     HAMMOND
     They still haven't moved from this position?

     HARRIMAN
     No, sir. Not for the last eighteen hours.

     HAMMOND
     What in God's name are they waiting for?

     SAMUELS
     My mission analysis team at the Pentagon believes they're waiting to
     see what moves we make. Amazingly, neither the Russians nor the
     Chinese have detected the Goa'uld presence yet. Of course, they're
     not looking, so from space, we should appear to be a vulnerable and
     unsuspecting world.

     HAMMOND
     Got 'em just where you want 'em, do you Samuels?

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, there may be another reason why they haven't attacked. We just
     completed the computer enhancement. There was an energy burst coming
     from what we think may be the bridge of one of the ships, recorded
     at 1750 hours, just before they stopped.

   [Hammond and Samuels watch the replay of the flash on a computer
   screen.]

     SAMUELS
     That's it?

     HAMMOND
     For all we know that flash, whatever it was, could be part of the
     ship's normal function.

     HARRIMAN
     Except that the burst came from within the ship itself, sir, and it
     was fairly powerful.

     SAMUELS
     Maybe an explosion? An accident?

     HAMMOND
     Or sabotage?

     HARRIMAN
     SG-1?

     SAMUELS
     I hardly think so. For one thing, it's impossible to gate to a ship.
     Forgive me, sir, I know how important SG-1 is to you, but this is
     wishful thinking.

     HAMMOND
     So's your plan, Colonel. That hasn't stopped us from going ahead
     with it.

     TECHNICIAN
     General Hammond, sir, the first group on the Alpha list has just
     arrived.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you.

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

     BRA'TAC
     Here are your weapons. You will need them.

     O'NEILL
     Erm, Bra'tac, you mentioned something about saving the world. Care
     to elaborate on that?

     BRA'TAC
     By assaulting Klorel, you have made that impossible.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     BRA'TAC
     Among the Goa'uld, a Pharaoh's power is more often challenged by
     their sons than by their enemies. Once we had joined battle with
     your world, I was prepared to lead my wing against Apophis, in
     Klorel's name.

     TEAL'C
     Apophis would assume your attack was ordered by Klorel and
     reciprocate. A daring plan!

     BRA'TAC
     I had hoped to drive a stake of mistrust between them. Now I fear
     they will bond against their common enemy.

     O'NEILL
     What bond? Klorel's dead.

     BRA'TAC
     He will rise again.

     DANIEL
     The Sarcophagus.

     O'NEILL
     Wait a minute. You put him in that thing to bring him back?

     BRA'TAC
     I knew it would delay their attack until he arose. Perhaps when the
     warships of your world attack...

     CARTER
     Um, excuse me, did you say "the ships of our world"?

     BRA'TAC
     Surely you have such vessels?

     DANIEL
     Well, we have a number of, of...

     O'NEILL and DANIEL
     Shuttles.

     BRA'TAC
     These shuttles--they are a formidable craft?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. Yeah. Bad day.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Ladies and Gentlemen, as you have all been made aware...

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Four encoded!

     HAMMOND
     ...this nation, the entire world, faces a deadly threat.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Five encoded!

     HAMMOND
     With this knowledge, you have all volunteered for a mission intended
     to preserve human kind. You've been chosen because you represent the
     best we have in all fields of expertise.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Six encoded!

     HAMMOND
     What you have not yet been told, for reasons of security, is where
     you're going or how you're going to get there.

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Seven--locked!

   [The Stargate kawooshes.]

     HAMMOND

     You're going to step through that.
     (he gestures behind him to the Stargate)
     Once through the Stargate, you will find yourself on the opposite
     side of this galaxy. A place we call Alpha Site. If we do not
     prevail, you, and those that follow, will call it "home". A new
     colony. Godspeed.

   [Hammond salutes.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Klorel rises from the sarcophagus.]

     KLOREL
     Let us burn their world to ashes!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     They're moving!

     SAMUELS

     (On phone)
     Restart the countdown. Hold at T minus 20 seconds. We will launch
     the weapons the moment they settle into orbit.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two ha'taks begin to move closer to Earth.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

     TEAL'C
     We accelerate. Klorel has risen.

     BRA'TAC
     Then the campaign has begun. Once we launch, we will do what damage
     we can.

     O'NEILL
     How many in your wing?

     BRA'TAC
     Three.

     O'NEILL
     Three?!

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c makes four.

     O'NEILL
     Oh well, four.

     BRA'TAC
     I have trained these warriors since they were Chal'til. They have
     sworn their lives to me. It is no simple thing to ask.

     O'NEILL
     And we appreciate it, believe me. But what are the odds of taking
     out a ship like this, with four gliders and ... maybe a shuttle?

     TEAL'C
     A Goa'uld attack vessel is heavily armed, shielded and capable of
     launching a legion of gliders against us. I would say slim.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, call me a pessimist, but I think it's time for a new plan.

     BRA'TAC
     We offer to lay down our lives for your world, Human. You cannot ask
     more.

     O'NEILL
     No, I can't. But I think a better idea is to get the other guys to
     lay down their lives for their world first, hmm? How long before the
     C4 goes?

     CARTER
     Forty-one minutes, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, with any luck at all, this ship is going to blow within the
     hour. It might be a good idea for us to get to the other one. Can
     you do that?

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Klorel activates at the control panel, looking out at Earth.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     SAMUELS

     (on telephone)
     That's it. They're in a geosynchronous orbit over the United States.
     Lock in that attack profile and advise the President we are go for
     launch.

   [On a computer screen, two missiles are seen being launched from Earth.
   On another screen, the trajectory of the two missiles is shown.]

     HARRIMAN
     Vandenberg reports a good launch.

     SAMUELS
     Yes! I'm sorry, sir. For what it's worth, I seriously doubt SG-1 is
     aboard those alien ships.

     HARRIMAN
     Weapons should reach the targets in--four minutes.

     HAMMOND
     In the meantime, let's keep moving these people through to the Alpha
     Site.

     HARRIMAN
     Group nine, prepare to disembark.

     SAMUELS
     Sir, we might as well wait and see the result of our strike before
     moving more people through.

     HAMMOND
     I don't think so.

     SAMUELS
     Evacuation may be unnecessary.

     HAMMOND
     From your mouth to God's ears, Colonel.

   INT--CORRIDOR ON KLOREL'S SHIP

     BRA'TAC
     Have you more of this 4C?

     O'NEILL
     It's called C4.

     CARTER
     The answer is no. We used it all to take out this ship.

     DANIEL
     Well you guys must have something left.

     BRA'TAC
     We shall have to cross that bridge when we come to it.

     O'NEILL
     You know, that particular cliche--doesn't always work.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     The warheads have separated. One minute to go.

     HAMMOND
     Any indication of countermeasures?

     SAMUELS
     I don't think they're going to know what hit 'em.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP

     JAFFA
     My Lord, they launch weapons against us.

     APOPHIS
     Let them come.

   the shields.]

     JAFFA
     Their weapons approach, my Lord. You must activate the shield.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP

     APOPHIS
     Klorel Tal shak, Tal shak!

   resisting.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The weapons hurtle through space toward the motherships.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Impact in seven, six, five...

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Klorel's eyes glow. He activates the shields just before the missiles
   hit. In a corridor, Daniel and Teal'c feel the impact.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa, what was that?

     TEAL'C
     Something may have impacted the shields.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Space Command reports that the warheads struck some kind of energy
     field just prior to impact. No damage.

     SAMUELS
     That's impossible!

     HARRIMAN
     NASA confirms, sir. The Goa'uld ships are still up there.

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--A CORRIDOR

   [SG-1, Bra'tac and his men are suddenly attacked by two Jaffa. O'Neill
   takes both out with a zat.]

     BRA'TAC
     Not bad. The peltak is two decks above. This way!

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     HAMMOND

     (on red telephone)
     Yes, sir. The EMP caused by the explosion has already affected our
     satellite communications. It will be difficult to warn the general
     public in time to do anything but cause mass panic. Mr. President, I
     strongly recommend that we maintain the highest defence condition at
     this time, and you should board Air Force One. Yes, sir.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP

   [Klorel enters via the transport rings.]

     APOPHIS
     Klorel, it is time. You will burn their first city to the ground.

     KLOREL
     Father, the host you chose for me is strong. I fear I may need more
     time in the Sarcophagus to gain strength.

     APOPHIS
     You are strong enough! You are my son!

     KLOREL
     Yes, Father.

     APOPHIS
     Do not disappoint me.

   [Klorel exits using the transport rings.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--A CORRIDOR

     O'NEILL
     Looks clear.

     BRA'TAC
     No. There are sentries in every corridor.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, how many grenades?

     CARTER
     Two left.

     BRA'TAC
     Grenades?

     TEAL'C
     A crude explosive device.

     BRA'TAC
     No! Observe--and learn.

   [Bra'tac strolls along the corridor. When he reaches two guards they
   see who he is and let him pass. Bra'tac whips round, felling both
   guards with his staff weapon.]

     BRA'TAC
     Hmmm!

     O'NEILL
     Not bad.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     TECHNICIAN
     General Hammond, sir. Major Castleman reports Alpha Teams 12 and 13
     are both briefed and ready to disembark.

     HAMMOND
     Send them through.

     SAMUELS

     (looking dishevelled)
     General. Maybe we should consider using the Stargate as a strategic
     weapons platform.

     HAMMOND
     How?

     SAMUELS
     By sending a bomb to the co-ordinates that Dr Jackson was talking
     about. Or to Chulak.

     HAMMOND
     We already tried to send a team through to Dr Jackson's
     co-ordinates. It won't work. And I can't think of any military
     reason to wipe out the people of Chulak!

     SAMUELS
     Well, sir, since I am no longer wanted or needed here, I
     respectfully request permission to join one of the teams headed for
     the Alpha Site, at least there...

     HAMMOND
     Permission denied! The idea is to send the best and brightest,
     Colonel. When the time comes, you will stand alongside the men and
     women of this Command, in defence of this facility.

     SAMUELS
     But, sir!

     HAMMOND
     I ask no more or less of myself. Dismissed!

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--A CORRIDOR

     O'NEILL
     All right, here's what we do.

     BRA'TAC
     I will lead. You will follow.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

     BRA'TAC
     You will know when it is time.

     DANIEL
     Whoa! You're just going to walk in there alone?

     BRA'TAC
     I am Klorel's loyal servant.

   INT--KLOREL'S CONTROL ROOM

     KLOREL
     Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     My Lord Klorel

   [SG-1 wait outside in the corridor.]

     KLOREL
     Come. Witness the power of your god.

     BRA'TAC
     I cannot.

     KLOREL
     Why do you defy me?

     BRA'TAC
     Because you are not a god. You are a parasite within a child, and I
     despise you.

     KLOREL
     Jaffa, Kree Tal! I am your god!

   [Klorel attacks Bra'tac with his hand device.]

     KLOREL
     And you will feel my wrath!

     BRA'TAC
     I--die--free!

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--CORRIDOR

     O'NEILL
     Let's go! Daniel, watch our backs.

   [Carter gives Daniel her MP5. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c rush into the
   room, firing as they go. The ensuing firefight sees most of the Jaffa
   hit. Teal'c prevents Klorel killing Bra'tac.]

     KLOREL
     Jaffa, Tal Shak!

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [As two Jaffa approach, Daniel shoots both with the MP5 in one hand and
   the pistol in the other.]

     DANIEL
     Jack!

   [A third Jaffa comes around the corner. Daniel fires but misses. The
   Jaffa fires on Daniel, hitting him in the chest. Daniel collapses, then
   pulls himself up and shoots the Jaffa. O'Neill comes out and crouches
   at Daniel's side, angry and afraid for his wounded friend.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel! Oh, dammit!

     DANIEL
     I'll be dead anyway. Just get out of here!

     O'NEILL
     I am not leaving you here, Daniel.

     DANIEL
     Get out of here! You're just going to blow up with the other ship
     anyway. What difference does it make? Go! Just go! I'll stay--and
     watch your back.

   [O'Neill gently touches Daniel's cheek, then leaves.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter and Teal'c look questioningly at O'Neill when he returns
   without Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     He's--staying behind.

     BRA'TAC
     Come.

   [Bra'tac, Klorel, O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c leave via the transport
   rings.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [Daniel drags himself along the floor.]

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP--CONTROL ROOM

   [The transport rings arrive. The Jaffa raise their staff weapons, but
   Apophis waves them down when he sees Klorel held hostage.]

     APOPHIS
     Kree, Jaffa!

     BRA'TAC
     Come, come, come!

     TEAL'C
     If you fire upon us, I will kill Klorel!

     APOPHIS
     Bra'tac, how dare you betray me?

     BRA'TAC
     I have spent 133 years worshipping false gods--no more!

   [Bra'tac shoots at the control panel and then leaves with the others,
   as Teal'c pushes Klorel into the room. Teal'c seals the door by
   shooting it from the outside with his zat.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, the C4 on the other ship goes in six minutes.

     O'NEILL
     How do we blow this ship?

     BRA'TAC
     When we were on Klorel's vessel, I directed it closer to this one.

     TEAL'C
     If we disable the shield generator of this vessel, both will be
     destroyed in the explosion. Two birds with but one stone.

     BRA'TAC
     This way.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP--CONTROL ROOM

     APOPHIS
     You disappoint me, my son.

     KLOREL
     Father. Please. Forgive me!

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP--WALKWAY ABOVE SHIELD GENERATORS

     BRA'TAC
     The shield generators are far below. There, in the very bowels of
     the ship. We must climb down several decks, through the length of
     the ship. Then, taking our weapons, we must...

   [O'Neill pulls the pins on two hand-grenades and drops them into the
   shield generators, blowing them up.]

     O'NEILL
     Grenades.

     TEAL'C
     This vessel is no longer protected by an energy field.

     CARTER
     So that's it?

     TEAL'C
     That is it.

     O'NEILL
     I think what the Captain is asking is, "What now?"

     BRA'TAC
     Now we die.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's a bad plan. Where are the glider bays from here?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     CHEVRON GUY
     Sir, Space Command reports the two ships seem to be moving closer
     together.

     HAMMOND
     What's the status of the shuttle Endeavour?

     HARRIMAN
     On the pad and standing by.

     HAMMOND
     We've got to find out what's going on up there.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP--GLIDER BAY

     O'NEILL
     Carter, you and I will go in first. We'll take up positions to...

   [Bra'tac raises his hand to silence O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Never mind.

     BRA'TAC
     Observe!

   [Bra'tac carefully rolls a shock grenade into the glider bay.]

     BRA'TAC
     Cover!

   [The ball explodes with a bright light and loud noise, disabling the
   Jaffa in the glider bay.]

     BRA'TAC
     Now, that was a grenade! Come.

   [In the glider bay, O'Neill and Bra'tac board one glider as Teal'c and
   Carter board a second one.]

     BRA'TAC
     Human, put this on.

   [He throws an earpiece over his shoulder to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Will you please stop calling me "Human"?

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

   [Daniel awakes in the sarcophagus. He climbs out and runs to check the
   timer on a pack of C4 he placed earlier. 1 minute 15 seconds left. He
   runs out of the room.

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP

   [Apophis sees Klorel's ship moving closer to his and tries to manoeuvre
   out of the way, but the controls are not working due to damage from
   Bra'tac's staff weapon.]

     APOPHIS
     No!

   [Apophis and Klorel leave via the transport rings.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP

   [With 28 seconds left, Daniel runs into the Gate room, stopping in
   front of the DHD.]

     DANIEL

     (muttering)
     Beta Site, Beta Site.

   [As the timer on the C4 ticks down to 16 seconds, Daniel begins to dial
   the DHD.]

   INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP--GLIDER BAYS

     O'NEILL
     Our time is up. We have got to go.

     CARTER
     Punch it.

   [The gliders fly out of the ship.]

   INT--KLOREL'S SHIP--GATE ROOM

   [Daniel hits the crystal on the DHD. The Gate kawooshes and just as the
   timer reaches 1 second, Daniel throws himself into the wormhole.]

   [Klorel's ship collides with Apophis's and both explode. The gliders
   are thrown away from the explosion.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, sir! We've got reports from all over the country. A huge
     fireball in the night sky!

   [Hammond looks around as everyone in the control room cheers and
   applauds.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Everyone in the two gliders recovers from the concussive force of the
   explosion.]

     O'NEILL
     Bra'tac? Bra'tac? You okay?

     BRA'TAC
     Not bad, for an old man.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Colonel? Come in.

     O'NEILL
     We're okay, Captain.

     CARTER
     Same here, sir. But I don't think we bought ourselves much time. Our
     glider's had it.

     TEAL'C
     I concur.

     CARTER
     We got cooked pretty bad in the explosion.

     O'NEILL
     Captain?

     CARTER
     We're low on power and in a fairly low orbit, so I don't imagine it
     will be too much longer before we burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

     O'NEILL
     Captain, take a look up.

   [Carter looks in awe up at the Earth.]

     CARTER
     It's beautiful.

     O'NEILL
     Yes it is.

     CARTER
     We saved it, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, we did.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Incoming traveller! Incoming traveller!
     (turns to Hammond just entering)
     It's SG-1's signal, sir!

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The iris pulls back and Daniel exits the wormhole. Hammond enters the
   Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Jackson! Was SG-1 aboard one of those ships?

     DANIEL
     Er, yes.

     HAMMOND
     Well, well how did you get...

     DANIEL
     Well, there was a Stargate aboard the ship we were on. So, once I
     realised we were close enough to use Earth as a point of origin, I
     dialled P3X-984.

     HAMMOND
     The Alpha Site?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, well they called it the Beta Site in the alternate reality,
     but...

     HAMMOND
     Where's the rest of SG-1?

   [Daniel looks sad.]

   EXT--SPACE

     CARTER
     It's going to be a beautiful sunset, sir.

     O'NEILL
     You know, Captain--this wasn't such a bad day after all.

     CARTER
     Not bad at all.

     BRA'TAC
     We die well, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     More than that, old friend--we die free!

     O'NEILL

     (looking out of the window)
     Or not ...

   [The Shuttle Endeavour comes into view.]

     SHUTTLE PILOT
     Er Houston, this is Endeavour. We have them in sight. I repeat, we
     have them in sight.

   EXT--SGC, DAY

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [As O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Bra'tac enter, a large crowd of
   personnel break into applause. Hammond approaches.]

     HAMMOND
     Master Bra'tac. Words cannot express our gratitude.

     BRA'TAC
     You are Hammond of Texas?

     HAMMOND
     I am.

     BRA'TAC
     Your warriors serve you well.

     HAMMOND
     I know they will be sorry to see you return home so soon.

     BRA'TAC
     I must return before word of our rebellion reaches Chulak. My place
     is there.

   [Bra'tac exchanges nods with Carter and grasps O'Neill's arms in
   farewell, before turning to Teal'c. He touches Teal'c's face.]

     AIRMAN
     This way, sir. We want to ask a few questions before you leave.

   [Bra'tac leaves with the airman.]

     O'NEILL
     Not bad at all.

     HAMMOND
     SG-1--there's someone who'd like to see you.

   [Daniel makes his way from the back of the crowd.]

     CARTER
     Daniel!

   [O'Neill, grinning, pulls Daniel into a bear hug.]

     O'NEILL

     (grasping his neck and hair)
     Spacemonkey! Yeah!

   [O'Neill steps back and holds Daniel's shoulders as Daniel returns his
   smile. Carter hugs Daniel before the assembled staff gather round,
   laughing and congratulating SG-1.]

   FADE OUT
