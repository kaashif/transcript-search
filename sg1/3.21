   FADE IN

   EXT--ALIEN WORLD (DAY)

   [The Stargate has been opened and a MALP is making its way down a vast
   walkway, heading towards an immense pyramid in the distance.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [SG-1, watching the MALP's progress on a computer, see the pyramid.]

     CARTER
     This is well over a thousand metres high.

     O'NEILL
     And as pyramids go that's...big?

     TEAL'C
     I know of no Goa'uld structure of that magnitude.

     DANIEL
     Definitely Mayan. This is a major find, I have to see this.

     O'NEILL
     Any signs of life there?

     CARTER
     There is a breathable atmosphere, sir, but no complex life signs.

   [On the computer, the MALP enters the pyramid. It comes to a huge
   cavern, filled with stalagmites.]

     CARTER
     This is a major find. I have to see this.

     O'NEILL
     You too?

     CARTER
     Well look at these readings, sir. These are leptons.

     O'NEILL
     Get out.

     CARTER
     That means something inside this pyramid is slowing down neutrinos.
     Normally neutrinos pass right through ordinary matter, no matter how
     dense. I mean, something like five hundred million billion just
     passed through you.

     O'NEILL
     No matter how dense?

     CARTER
     A material that slows neutrinos could change everything we know
     about physics, the formation of the universe...

     DANIEL

     (cutting her off)
     Wait a minute, Sam. Get uh, get closer.

   [The MALP's camera shows a narrow bridge, leading to a stone island in
   the centre of the cavern.]

     CARTER
     I can't. The MALP's too big to cross the span.

     DANIEL
     Zoom in. On that.

   [He points at the screen and Carter zooms in. The camera focuses on a
   pink skull.]

     TEAL'C
     It appears to be a human skull.

     DANIEL
     No that's a crystal skull.

     CARTER
     How do you know?

     DANIEL
     Because it's exactly like the one found in 1971 in Belize. By my
     grandfather.

   END OF TEASER

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Daniel is standing before the projector, clicking each picture to the
   next. They show various archaeological digs and other crystal skulls
   found on Earth.]

     DANIEL
     I could name at least a dozen different crystal skulls from various
     parts of the world, but the skull that Nick discovered in Belize was
     unique.

     O'NEILL
     Nick?

     DANIEL
     Uh, yeah, the uh...the great explorer, the not so great grandfather
     Nicholas Ballard. He preferred being called Nick even when I was a
     kid. It was uh...Anyway, the point is that no one can explain how
     the skull that Nick discovered was carved from a single piece of
     crystal, against the grain, given the technology of the day. He
     claimed that it possessed a certain...power.

     HAMMOND
     What kind of power?

     DANIEL
     That if one were to look into the eyes of the skull, one would be
     teleported to see...aliens.

     TEAL'C
     Your grandfather saw these aliens?

     DANIEL
     So he insisted to the entire academic community.

     FRASIER
     I take it his claim didn't go over very well.

     DANIEL
     As you might imagine, no. Um, he tried for years under controlled
     conditions to make the skull teleport him again to where the aliens
     lived, but he...never could.

     O'NEILL
     Doesn't mean he wasn't right.

     CARTER
     The academic community didn't believe your theory that the pyramids
     were landing sites for alien spaceships either.

     O'NEILL
     We have to see this.

     HAMMOND
     I'll authorise a standard recon mission.

     FRASIER
     Colonel I can only guess the effect this type of radiation may have
     on the human body. I recommend limited exposure, ten, fifteen
     minutes at most.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute, that's not enough time. I mean, there has to be some
     sort of radiation suit or...

     O'NEILL
     Hey. If you'd been listening, you'd know that Nintendo's pass
     through everything.

     DANIEL
     I heard.

   [Carter smiles.]

     O'NEILL
     Everything.

   EXT--ALIEN WORLD (DAY)

   [The Stargate closes as SG-1 walk towards the pyramid.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa.

   INT--PYRAMID

   [SG-1 find the MALP, still sitting at the end of the narrow bridge.
   Carter is checking radiation readings with a device.]

     CARTER
     Muon radiation is increasing.

     O'NEILL
     Unhealthy?

     CARTER
     I don't think so, sir. Not if it stays at these levels.

   [They stand at the edge of the huge cavern, looking out across the
   bridge.]

     TEAL'C
     Whoever the builders are, they appear to be a formidable race.

     DANIEL
     You could fit every pyramid on Earth inside this thing and still
     have room to spare.

     O'NEILL
     Can you imagine heating this place?

   [He steps out onto the bridge and they begin to cross towards the
   island.]

     O'NEILL
     Major? Start the clock.

   [They reach the other side and Daniel heads over to the skull, mounted
   on a stone pedestal.]

     DANIEL
     It's identical to the one Nick discovered in Belize.

     TEAL'C
     Can you determine if it is a means of transport as your grandfather
     believed?

     DANIEL
     Uh, I can't be sure, there's no writings of any kind on the
     pedestal.

     CARTER

     (to the others)
     This cavern must act like some sort of containment body.

     DANIEL

     (to himself)
     It's no wonder Nick was so fascinated.

     CARTER
     If I can get a sample of the substance that's slowing down these
     neutrinos, we can change the face of physics.

     DANIEL
     It's like a living thing, it's...

     O'NEILL
     I wonder how far down that it.

   [He cautiously glances over the edge as Teal'c approaches Daniel, who
   is staring into the skull's eyes.]

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson.

   [Daniel doesn't answer, seemingly engrossed. As Teal'c watches, the
   skull is filled with tiny lights.]

     CARTER
     Sir, radiation is spiking! It's at three hundred percent.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     Four hundred.

     O'NEILL
     Right, that's it, we're outta here. Daniel?

   [The lights explode from the skull in an energy field that engulfs
   Daniel. Teal'c raises his zat and fires at the skull, knocking Daniel
   away. The energy field collapses. Daniel is lying stunned on the floor,
   but none of the others go over to check on him.]

     O'NEILL
     Where'd he go?

   [Teal'c crosses over to the stone pedestal and steps right through
   Daniel where he is lying unconscious on the floor.]

     TEAL'C
     He seemed to disappear.

     CARTER
     Sir, these readings are off the scale now. If we don't leave here
     soon...

   [She suddenly passes out and is caught by O'Neill, who lifts her over
   his shoulder and starts running back across the bridge.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, get out of there!

   [After a moment, Teal'c turns and runs after them.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

     TECHNICIAN
     Incoming traveller, sir. It's SG-1.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The iris is opened as Hammond runs into the Gate room. O'Neill, Carter
   and Teal'c stumble through the Stargate and collapse on the gate ramp.
   Hammond rushes up to them.]

     HAMMOND
     Get a medical team in here!

   [An airman rushes off to get FRASIER. Carter appears unconscious, while
   O'Neill and Teal'c struggle to move.]

     HAMMOND
     Where's Doctor Jackson?

   [None of them can answer and O'Neill passes out.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are lying in the infirmary, while FRASIER
   and other medical personal attend to them. Teal'c is conscious as
   O'Neill slowly wakes up, sweating, and puts a hand to his head.]

     FRASIER

     (to Hammond)
     He's coming to, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Carter? Daniel?

     FRASIER
     She's still unconscious. Teal'c is better off than both of you. His
     symbiote is helping him. It was close, Colonel. If you hadn't left
     when you did...

     O'NEILL
     Hot.

     FRASIER

     Yes, I know. We're trying to keep your temperature down. The muon
     radiation affected your hypothalamus. (She pats him down with a damp
     cloth.)
     Essentially, your internal thermostat went haywire. Your
     respiration, heartbeat and your temperature have been fluctuating
     wildly.

     O'NEILL
     No kidding.

     HAMMOND
     As for Dr Jackson, Colonel, he never returned with you.

     TEAL'C

     (sitting up)
     He is no longer there, General Hammond. The skull enveloped him in
     an energy field. I fired my zat'nikatel, but it was too late. He
     seemed to disappear.

     HAMMOND
     What?

   INT--PYRAMID

   [Daniel is still lying on the floor, unconscious.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN (NIGHT)

   [Armed guards are patrolling the entrance to the mountain.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [The Stargate is open and Hammond and a technician are looking through
   the MALP's camera.]

     HAMMOND
     Pan the camera left again.

   [He points to the screen and the technician obeys.]

     HAMMOND
     Do the infrared sensors detect any sign of Dr Jackson?

     TECHNICIAN
     No, sir.

   [Teal'c enters the Control Room.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Teal'c)
     You should be in the Infirmary.

     TEAL'C
     I am well again, General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     Not according to Dr FRASIER.

     TEAL'C
     Nicholas Ballard believed the crystal skull to be a teleportation
     device. Recovering the skull may help us to determine the location
     to which he was teleported.

     HAMMOND
     The MALP telemetry suggests the radiation levels are still too high.

     TEAL'C
     My symbiote provides me with a greater tolerance against the effects
     of radiation.

     HAMMOND
     And if that thing zaps you to where it sent Dr Jackson?

     TEAL'C
     Then I will have succeeded in locating him.

   [Hammond appears to consider his offer.]

   INT--PYRAMID

   [Teal'c is running across the narrow bridge towards the crystal skull
   and pedestal. He doesn't see Daniel lying on the floor. Daniel slowly
   wakes up and climbs to his feet as Teal'c runs passed and begins to
   take off his pack.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c!

   [Teal'c grabs the skull and puts it into his pack, not answering.]

     DANIEL
     What happened? Where is everybody?

   [Teal'c still doesn't answer. He pauses to look around, then heads down
   the steps, passing straight through Daniel on his way out.]

     DANIEL

     (shocked)
     You just ran right through me. Teal'c!

   [He starts running after Teal'c. Teal'c pauses at the end of the bridge
   and looks back. Daniel stops but it's clear Teal'c doesn't see him.]

     DANIEL
     What the hell is going on?

   [Teal'c turns and starts running back to the Stargate.]

   INT--GATE ROOM, SGC

   [The Stargate opens and Teal'c steps through, closely followed by
   Daniel. The Stargate immediately closes behind them, almost catching
   Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (annoyed, to the technicians)
     Hey!

   [Teal'c heads down to the bottom of the ramp where Hammond and Siler
   are waiting for him.]

     HAMMOND
     Well done, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Regrettably, there was no sign of Daniel Jackson.

   [Teal'c hands the pack to Siler as Daniel runs down to them.]

     DANIEL
     So I take it nobody else can see me either?

   [He waves his hand in front of Siler, who doesn't react.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Siler)
     Dr Rothman is awaiting the artefact in Lab 3C.

     SILER
     Yes, sir.

   [Siler heads off as Daniel waves his hand through Hammond.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter will also want to study it.

     HAMMOND
     As soon as she's fully recovered.

   [Daniel glances at his hand, then at Hammond.]

     DANIEL
     Recovered from what? What happened?

   [They fail to answer him and walk away.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c enters the Infirmary, followed by an invisible Daniel, and
   heads over to Carter's bed.]

     FRASIER
     She's going to be fine, Teal'c. Her exposure wasn't long enough to
     cause any permanent damage.

     O'NEILL
     Doc!

   [Frasier turns to the other bed and pulls back the curtain. O'Neill is
   lying in the other bed, wrapped up to keep warm.]

     FRASIER
     You can protest all you want, Colonel, but it'll be a while before
     you get your strength back. So relax.

     O'NEILL
     Oh come on...

     FRASIER
     Ah! Doctor's orders.

   [She leaves.]

     O'NEILL

     (muttering)
     Napoleonic power monger. (He rolls over to face Teal'c.)
     News?

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson was nowhere in the vicinity of the pyramid.

     O'NEILL
     What the hell happened to him?

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe the skull is a weapon, O'Neill.

     DANIEL

     (to himself)
     Well, you're right about that, it's not a weapon.

     TEAL'C
     It is indeed a teleportation device. I believe the artefact
     itself...

     DANIEL

     (speaking over him)
     No, something else happened.

     TEAL'C
     Dr ROTHMAN is now studying it.

     O'NEILL
     ROTHMAN couldn't figure out an ashtray. The guy we need working on
     that skull is Daniel.

     TEAL'C
     It is he whom we endeavour to locate, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Look, I'm sick of laying around. Help me up.

     TEAL'C
     Dr FRASIER believes you are not strong enough to undertake such a
     mission.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, whatever.

   [He tries to get up and succeeds in rolling off the bed and onto the
   floor.]

     TEAL'C
     Dr FRASIER is usually correct in such matters.

   [He bends down and hauls O'Neill back onto the bed to lie facedown.]

     O'NEILL

     (muffled)
     Thank you.

     TEAL'C
     You are welcome, O'Neill.

   INT--ROTHMAN's OFFICE, SGC

   [Rothman has the crystal skull on his desk and is flicking through
   papers. Daniel is leaning on the desk, speaking to him.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, you can do this Robert, I know you can. Focus on the Mayan
     legends, on the lost pyramids of Belize, the Ballard skull, that's
     where the answer is.

     ROTHMAN

     (sounding like he has a cold)
     Well, it's a crystal skull.

     HAMMOND
     We knew that Doctor.

     ROTHMAN
     It's almost identical to Nicholas Ballard's skull in the
     Smithsonian.

     DANIEL
     He doesn't know it was found on P7X-377.

     ROTHMAN
     Actually, the craftsmanship is very impressive. It's probably made
     in Germany, early 1800s. What I don't understand is what it has to
     do with Daniel being missing?

     TEAL'C
     We believe it to be a teleportation device.

     ROTHMAN
     Are you serious?

     DANIEL
     That's good, Robert. Be sceptical.

     HAMMOND
     We were hoping your archaeological expertise could help provide
     insight into where he may have been sent.

   [Rothman inhales a nasal spray.]

     ROTHMAN

     (cynically)
     It's a skull!

     DANIEL

     (closing his eyes)
     Not that sceptical.

     TEAL'C
     I myself witnessed the artefact create a tremendous field of energy
     which engulfed Daniel Jackson.

     ROTHMAN
     It's made of crystal, not plutonium. I don't see how this could...

     HAMMOND

     (cutting him off)
     Humour me, Doctor! I want a full report within twelve hours.

     ROTHMAN
     Yes, sir. I-I was...

     TEAL'C
     Do not look directly into its eyes.

     ROTHMAN
     Ok.

     DANIEL
     Don't let me down, Robert.

   [He follows Teal'c and Hammond out of the door.]

     ROTHMAN
     Teleportation device?

   [He looks to SILER, working opposite him.]

     ROTHMAN
     What do you think?

     SILER
     I think you're gonna get fired.

   INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS, SGC

   [Teal'c is meditating in his quarters, sitting cross-legged and
   surrounded by dozens of lit candles. Daniel, unseen, is sitting
   opposite him, watching.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c. In case I don't ever get the chance to...say this. If you
     hadn't come back for me, I would have been stuck in that place
     forever so...thank you.

   [Teal'c's eyes snap open and he looks around.]

     TEAL'C
     Is there someone present?

     DANIEL

     (excitedly)
     Yes.
     (He gets to his feet and stands before Teal'c.)
     Yes, it, it's me, it's Daniel. I'm right here. I'm right here, just
     don't walk...

   [Teal'c passes through him.]

     DANIEL
     ...through me. It's very disconcerting.

   [Teal'c opens the door and look out into the corridor. Daniel follows
   him out.]

     DANIEL
     You sensed I was in the room, you just can't see or hear me. Which
     is a little frustrating as you may imagine.

   [Teal'c returns to his quarters and closes the door. Daniel appears
   disappointed.]

   INT--ROTHMAN's OFFICE, SGC

   [Rothman has his face close to the skull's and he is gazing into its
   eyes.]

     CARTER
     Stop!

   [He jumps and looks up as Carter and FRASIER enter the room.]

     CARTER

     (cont'd)
     That is exactly what Daniel was doing when he was absorbed by the
     energy field.

   [Daniel is sitting on a table in the corner.]

     DANIEL

     (wearily)
     That's what I've been trying to tell him.

   [He drops his head.]

     ROTHMAN
     I-I know that. I was trying to prove something.

   [He takes off his glasses.]

     FRASIER
     Prove what?

     DANIEL
     That the skull didn't do this.

     CARTER

     (to Rothman)
     You don't think the skull is responsible for what happened to
     Daniel, do you?

     ROTHMAN
     I'm still here.

     CARTER
     There was intense muon radiation at the time the energy...

     ROTHMAN
     There is no residual radiation.

     CARTER
     Look, I saw what that thing is capable of.

     ROTHMAN
     Hey, I wish it was a teleportation device. I could use it to go find
     Daniel. He's my friend too, you know. I don't think that's what
     we've got here. I think what we've got here is...a paperweight.

   [Carter looks angry.]

     ROTHMAN

     (apologetic)
     I'm sorry. I...that's my opinion.

   [He turns away, looking tired.]

     CARTER

     It's all right. I'll take over from here.
     (to Siler)
     There may be properties within the crystalline structure that are
     invisible to the naked eye. We should run some diagnostic tests.

   [Frasier goes over to a table to fetch Carter a glass of water.]

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute, I'm not hungry or thirsty. Why not?

     CARTER

     (to Frasier)
     Thank you.

   [Daniel jumps off the table.]

     DANIEL
     Because I'm dead?

   [Carter stops drinking her water and appears disturbed.]

     ROTHMAN

     (looking around)
     What?

     CARTER
     Did anybody else feel that?

     FRASIER
     What?

     DANIEL
     What if I'm a ghost?

     CARTER
     I just got a shiver.

     FRASIER
     Well, you're still feeling the after-effects of the radiation.

     DANIEL
     No, I think that was me.

   [He appears as disturbed as Carter.]

   INT--GATE ROOM, SGC

   [Technicians are preparing a UAV for launch.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [The Stargate is dialling up.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron four encoded...

   [SG-1 is present, along with FRASIER. Daniel is sitting behind them on
   a piece of equipment.]

     CARTER

     (to Hammond)
     Sir, we've subjected the skull to every piece of diagnostic
     equipment we have.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron five encoded...

     HAMMOND
     What have you found?

     CARTER
     Nothing.

     O'NEILL
     We could take another look at that planet, sir.

     FRASIER
     I'd strongly recommend against it. We're still getting readings
     periodically from the MALP. The radiation levels have dropped
     slightly, but their still elevated.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron six encoded...

     HAMMOND
     We are preparing a UAV for a long-range search around the pyramid. I
     don't see any point in risking another SG team unless that search
     turns up something.

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron seven locked.

   [The Stargate opens.]

     HAMMOND
     Launch when ready, sergeant.

     TECHNICIAN
     Launching UAV in five, four, three, two, one...mark.

   [The UAV shoots into the wormhole.]

     CARTER
     I can't believe I'm gonna suggest this, but what about Daniel's
     grandfather?

     DANIEL AND O'NEILL

     (in unison)
     Nick?

     CARTER
     Well, he claimed that the skull teleported him somewhere. He may be
     the only person who actually knows where Daniel is.

     FRASIER
     I'm not so sure, Major. I've already taken the liberty of looking
     him up.

     DANIEL

     (cringing)
     Oh you didn't.

     FRASIER
     His current address is a psychiatric institution in Oregon.

     O'NEILL
     Psychiatric?

     FRASIER
     Apparently his failure to prove the crystal skull was more than just
     a curiosity caused a severe mental breakdown from which he's never
     been able to fully recover. Nick checked himself in.

     CARTER
     Why wouldn't Daniel have told us that?

     DANIEL
     Oh, yes, by the way he's insane.

     FRASIER
     Daniel was a regular visitor there up until four years ago, right
     before he joined the Stargate program.

     DANIEL
     Oh please, he kicked me out. We had a huge fight.

     FRASIER
     Apparently, Nick still talks about him all the time.

     DANIEL
     He doesn't want anything to do with me.

     FRASIER
     The doctor I spoke to says any friends of Dr Jackson's are welcome.

     DANIEL

     (surprised)
     What?

     CARTER
     We don't have much else to go on.

     HAMMOND
     Find out what you can, but I needn't remind you the details of this
     matter will have to remain classified. That means you won't be able
     to tell him what happened to Dr Jackson or where the skull was
     found.

   INT--PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION, OREGON (DAY)

   [O'Neill is fetching himself a drink from a machine and being stared at
   intensely by an inmate.]

     NURSE

     (over intercom)
     Dr Nelson, please report to ward 2 East. Dr Nelson, please report to
     ward 2 East.

   [O'Neill quickly walks away and heads over to Carter and Teal'c. Daniel
   is leaning, unnoticed, against a wall.]

   [A nurse comes out of a room to meet them.]

     NURSE
     Sorry for the wait. Is there anything I can do for you?

     TEAL'C
     You may take us to Nicholas Ballard immediately.

   [The nurse appears taken aback at his abrupt manner.]

     O'NEILL
     He's just a little anxious to see old Nick.

     NURSE
     Oh, are you close?

     O'NEILL
     Yes.

     TEAL'C

     (at the same time)
     No.

   [O'Neill looks at him.]

     TEAL'C
     Yes, extremely.

     NURSE
     Well, I'll just check and see if he's ready for you.

     DANIEL
     What am I waiting for?

   [He follows the nurse and passes through the doors to Nick's room.
   Inside, Nick and a doctor are present.]

     NURSE

     (to the Doctor)
     Colonel O'Neill and his party are here.

     DOCTOR

     (to Nick)
     Friends of Daniel I told you about are here, just outside. Would you
     like to see them now?

   [Daniel crosses the room and Nick seems to watch him.]

     NICK
     I miss him.

     DANIEL
     Hi Nick, long time no see.

     DOCTOR

     (to Nurse)
     Would you show them in please?

   [Daniel crouches down before his grandfather.]

     DANIEL
     Nick, I need your help. Friends of mine want to ask you about the
     skull you found in Belize. Tell them everything, just trust them.

   [The rest of SG-1 enter the room.]

     DOCTOR
     Nick, this Colonel Jack O'Neill. He's a friend of Daniel's.

     O'NEILL
     Doctor, would you mind if we...?

   [The doctor understands and leaves.]

     NICK

     (pointing to himself)
     Nick.

     O'NEILL

     Jack. (He offers his hand, but Nick doesn't take it.)
     Colonel.

   [He sits opposite Nick.]

     NICK
     Daniel followed my footsteps.

     O'NEILL
     You must be very proud.

     NICK
     He made a fool of himself.

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah, here we go.

     NICK
     He staked his entire academic career on this belief that the great
     pyramids of Egypt were made by aliens.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, well, that's...

     NICK
     He was more insane than I was. I told him so. I told him to forget
     all that nonsense.

     DANIEL
     Uh, it wasn't nonsense. I was right.

     NICK
     He lost his apartment, his research grant, he hasn't published a
     paper in two years. Now where is he? Where is he now?

     CARTER
     In a way, that's what this is all about. We wanted to hear exactly
     what happened to you back in '71 when you first found the skull.

     NICK
     Nothing happened. There were no aliens.

     DANIEL
     Trust them, Nick.

     NICK
     No one believed me.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel believed you.

     DANIEL
     Oh, no, no, no don't. Don't.

     NICK
     He didn't. He wanted to. He did listen. In the end he did not
     believe in my theories of the skull just as I did not believe his
     theories of the pyramids and the aliens.

     DANIEL
     I guess we both were right.

     O'NEILL
     Nick, can you tell us what happened when you found that skull?

     NICK
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     Because we've found another skull, identical to the one you found in
     Belize.

     NICK
     Show me.

     CARTER
     It's in a high security facility at the moment. But if you tell us
     about your experiences, we...

     NICK
     Then take me there.

     O'NEILL
     We can't do that. It's classified.

     DANIEL
     You have to.

     NICK
     If you don't, then I won't tell you anything.

   [He gets up and goes over to the window, looking out.]

     NICK
     It is up to you.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE, SGC

   [Daniel is leaning, unobserved, against the window, while O'Neill
   speaks with Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, there is no greater secret in this nation than the
     Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     So, we keep him away from level 28.

     HAMMOND
     A civilian? Who has spent the last twenty years of his life in a
     psychiatric institution?

     O'NEILL
     Exactly. Who's gonna believe him if he says anything?

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, you walk a fine line.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, sir.

   [He walks out. The phone rings.]

     HAMMOND

     (into the phone)
     Hammond.

     DANIEL
     General, I know you can't hear me, but thank you.

     HAMMOND

     (cont'd)
     Absolutely, put her through. Kayla, sweetheart, this is grandpa.
     Isn't this past your bedtime?
     (He laughs at something his granddaughter says)
     You lost another tooth. Well, you put it under you pillow tonight. I
     bet your big sister Tessa wishes she lost a tooth.
     (He pauses as she speaks)
     I'd love to come to see you in your school play tomorrow night,
     sweetheart, but can't. Well, a very close friend of mine is lost and
     he needs my help. Yes, he's a very close friend. I hope so too.

   [Daniel pauses, seemingly touched, then leaves.]

   INT--CARTER'S LABORATORY, SGC

   [Nick is escorted into the lab where the skull is being kept. He walks
   over to it and reaches out to touch it.]

     SILER
     I don't think you should touch that, sir.

     CARTER
     Uh, it's all right, sergeant, thank you. Nick, this is Doctor Robert
     Rothman.

     ROTHMAN

     (eagerly offering his hand)
     It's, it's a pleasure to meet you...

     NICK

     (ignoring him completely)
     It's exactly the same as the one I found in Belize. Where did you
     find it?

     O'NEILL
     We can't tell you that.

     DANIEL
     You're gonna have to tell him eventually, Jack.

     NICK

     The skull stood on a stone pedestal.
     (He interprets their knowing looks.)
     You have been there, haven't you?

     CARTER
     You mean Belize?

     NICK
     No, no, no. That was the ruins of the temple where I found the
     skull. But it's all gone, collapsed. I am talking about a cavern.

     TEAL'C
     Do you know the location of this cavern?

     NICK
     Nowhere on this Earth. It was so enormous that...that the light of
     my torch never reached the bottom.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but how did you get there?

     NICK
     I don't know how I got there. A field of energy surrounded me and
     suddenly I was simply there. And then they came.

     CARTER
     They?

     NICK
     The giants.

     CARTER
     Giants?

     NICK
     The giant aliens. They rose up as if they were made of mist. They
     flew around me like spectres.

     DANIEL
     Now you know why no one believed him.

     NICK
     They spoke 'Oo ya waaling waaling wey tayil'.

     ROTHMAN
     That's, that's Mayan. The enemy of my enemy...

     DANIEL

     (speaking over him)
     The enemy of my enemy is my friend, yes, but what does it mean?

     NICK
     I was afraid to answer. I just closed my eyes and suddenly I found
     myself back again under the temple in Belize. And the ground was
     shaking as if in an earthquake and I just grabbed the skull
     and...and climbed out and everything collapsed.

     O'NEILL
     Wow, that's uh...giants.

     CARTER
     So, you were sent to this cavern and back again without ever knowing
     where it was, in the ruins where you found the skull?

     NICK
     I spent years trying to find it again, but it was as if the temple
     never existed.

     CARTER
     So I guess you couldn't take us there either.

     NICK
     Can you imagine what it feels like to go on the most incredible
     journey of your life and have no one believe you?

   [No one answers.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, Teal'c, you wanna escort Nick down to the VIP room?

     TEAL'C
     Nicholas Ballard, would you come with me please.

   [Nick tears himself away from the skull and follows him out of the
   room.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Rothman)
     So. Tell you anything?

     ROTHMAN
     Oh, maybe. I mean, I...uh, no.

     O'NEILL
     Work on it.

   [He and Carter leave.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [O'Neill and Carter are heading down the corridor towards the
   elevator.]

     CARTER
     He described the cavern perfectly, sir, he had to have been there.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, giants?

     DANIEL
     Yes, that's weird, I admit.

     CARTER
     Somebody built that place.

     O'NEILL
     Didn't help us.

     DANIEL
     But if he really was transported to P7X-377, maybe this skull was
     trying to send me somewhere and something interrupted the process.

   [Carter enters the elevator and turns to O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     Do you get the feeling that Daniel is still around?

     DANIEL
     We have to go back there.

     O'NEILL
     Kinda.

     CARTER
     I guess it's 'cause we miss him.

     DANIEL
     And we have to talk to those giant aliens.

     O'NEILL
     Or radiation sickness.

   [Carter smiles.]

     CARTER
     Goodnight, sir.

   [The lift doors close and O'Neill heads back down the corridor.]

     DANIEL

     (calling after O'Neill)
     What? That's...that's it? What ever happened to working through the
     night?
     (In a small voice)
     I'd do it for you.

   INT--VIP ROOM, SGC

   [Teal'c shows Nick to his room.]

     TEAL'C
     There will be a guard posted outside your door should you require
     assistance.

     NICK
     When you see Daniel, would you tell him I...? Well, never mind. It's
     something I should tell him myself.

     TEAL'C
     Very well.

   [Teal'c leaves and the airwoman closes the door. Nick sits down on the
   bed. Daniel is leaning against a wall, watching.]

     NICK
     I am sorry.

     DANIEL
     For what?

     NICK
     For not adopting you when your parents died.

     DANIEL
     You were travelling all over the world.

     NICK
     It wasn't your fault.

     DANIEL
     I was eight years old, how could it have been my fault?

     NICK

     I am sorry for allowing my obsession to drive me to madness.
     (He looks directly at Daniel.)
     Would you forgive me?

     DANIEL

     (walking towards him)
     You can see me?

     NICK
     Yes Daniel, I can see you.

     DANIEL

     (exasperated)
     Why didn't you say something?!

     NICK
     You're not real so it doesn't mean anything.

     DANIEL

     (going to his knees before the bed)
     No, no, no no, Nick. Nick, I'm real, I'm real. You're not
     hallucinating.

     NICK
     Hallucinations always say that.

     DANIEL
     Not this time, Nick. The skull, the skull did this to me. I'm
     trapped, I'm in another dimension, I'm out of phase, something.
     Look, all I know is I need your help. If you don't help me, I don't
     know how I'm gonna get home.

   [Nick appears shocked.]

     NICK
     So what do you want me to do?

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [Hammond, Frasier and O'Neill are in conference when Nick comes down
   the stairs, escorted by an airwoman and followed closely by Daniel.]

     AIRWOMAN
     Sirs, Mr Ballard insisted on seeing both of you immediately.

     NICK
     Forgive me. He insisted. Daniel is here.

     HAMMOND
     Here?

     DANIEL
     Repeat what I'm saying. 'I'm standing right beside you'.

     NICK
     Standing right beside me.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     He's lost a few pounds.

     DANIEL
     Jack, don't be an ass.

     NICK

     (repeating his words)
     Jack, don't be an ass.

   [They all seem surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Yes. We have to go back to the planet and we have to let the skull
     finish what it started.

     NICK
     We must go back to the planet.

     HAMMOND

     (to O'Neill)
     Planet?

     O'NEILL
     Uh, not a word, sir, I swear.

     NICK
     Daniel told me all about the Stargate. We must replace the skull on
     the pedestal so that the giant aliens will come. Something must have
     interrupted this process.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, Teal'c fired his zat. That's all I can imagine it would be, sir.

     DANIEL
     That's it. That's what interrupted the process. We have to, we have
     to...let it happen, we have to trust it.

     HAMMOND

     (to Nick)
     Why didn't you say something sooner?

     NICK
     I thought I-I was hearing voices. It wouldn't have been for the
     first time.

     FRASIER
     Forgive me, but why are you the only person who can see him?

     NICK
     Perhaps because I went through the same experience.

     DANIEL
     Tell General Hammond if we go back right now, he might be able to
     see his granddaughter's school play after all.

     NICK
     General Hammond, if you let us go now, you may be able to see your
     granddaughter's play.

     HAMMOND

     I was alone in my office when Kayla phoned.
     (to the air beside Nick)
     Uh, Dr Jackson, are you absolutely certain you and SG-1 can safely
     return to the planet?

     DANIEL
     Say yes.

     NICK
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     It's good enough for me, sir.

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [O'Neill and Nick are heading towards the Gate room, trailed by
   Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     So it wasn't the skull alone that did this, it was its connection to
     the cavern.

     DANIEL
     Yes, I think the skull is just the icon that represents the human
     form.

     NICK
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     And Daniel said you should come along to make it work?

     DANIEL
     Wait, I never said that. You're taking advantage of me.

     NICK
     Yes.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [Carter and Teal'c are already waiting at the bottom of the ramp. The
   Stargate opens and the event horizon shoots out, shocking Nick.]

     NICK

     (to Daniel)
     So this is what you have been doing these past few years.

     DANIEL
     Exploring planets.

     HAMMOND

     (over microphone)
     SG-1, you have a go. Maintain radio contact.

   [O'Neill and Carter head up the ramp and disappear through the
   Stargate.]

     NICK
     Daniel, behind that is another world? You must tell me everything.

     DANIEL
     As soon as we get back, I promise.

     TEAL'C
     After you, Nicholas Ballard.

   [They head up the ramp and enter the Stargate.]

   VFX--SHOOTING THROUGH WORMHOLE

   EXT--ALIEN WORLD (DAY)

   [SG-1, along with Nick cross the long expanse towards the pyramid.]

   INT--PYRAMID

   [They enter the pyramid and pause by the original MALP, looking out
   over the cavern.]

     NICK

     (excitedly)
     It's just as I remembered it. This is where they live.

   [He starts to cross the narrow bridge, stumbles slightly and is
   steadied by O'Neill. They cross the bridge and reach the island. Daniel
   walks over to the pedestal while Teal'c retrieves the skull from his
   pack. He hands to Nick, who goes to the pedestal and places it on top.]

     NICK
     Now we must wait for the giant aliens.

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     That just has a nice ring to it.

   [Nick steps down from the pedestal.]

     O'NEILL

     (into his radio)
     General Hammond, we're in position.

     HAMMOND

     (over the radio)
     Understood Colonel. Proceed.

   [Daniel bends forward and looks directly into the eyes of the skull. It
   starts to glow and the energy field springs up, enveloping all of
   them.]

     CARTER
     Sir, radiation's climbing again.

     NICK

     (looking at the lights surrounding them)
     This is incredible.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel said to let it happen.

   [Daniel is still staring into the eyes of the skull, when the field
   collapses back into the skull.]

     CARTER

     (seeing him)
     Daniel!

   [He turns around.]

     DANIEL
     Sam.

   [He heads down the steps towards them.]

     DANIEL

     (cont'd)
     It worked.

   [Teal'c is looking around.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill! Major Carter!

   [He doesn't appear to be able to see any of them. O'NEILL waves his
   hand through TEAL'C.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     It appears that we're out of phase like Daniel, but Teal'c isn't.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     You're asking me?

     TEAL'C

     (into his radio)
     General Hammond, I was not teleported with the others.

     HAMMOND

     (over the radio)
     Return to base immediately.

   [After one last look around, Teal'c obeys. A mist suddenly rises up
   from below them, materialising into the form of a giant, human-shaped
   being.]

     O'NEILL

     (taking a step back)
     Holy smoke, Bullwinkle! Hello! What's your name?

     GIANT ALIEN
     Quetzalcoatl. Oo ya waaling waaling wey tayil.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'

     O'NEILL
     I know what it's saying, why is it saying that?

     DANIEL
     It didn't affect Teal'c, why?

     CARTER
     Because he's Jaffa.

     DANIEL
     He's carrying a symbiote, a Goa'uld.

   [He steps towards the alien.]

     DANIEL

     (to the alien)
     We are enemies of the Goa'uld!

     GIANT ALIEN

     (in English)
     Then you are welcome here.

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     Keep talking.

     DANIEL
     We're travellers, we come in search of friendship. We'd like to
     exchange our knowledge and culture.

     GIANT ALIEN

     We accept your proposition.
     (He points to Nick.)
     You may remain.

     NICK
     Me?

     O'NEILL
     Him?

     GIANT ALIEN

     (to Nick)
     This is not the first time you have journeyed here.

     NICK
     You remember.

     DANIEL

     (to the alien)
     There are others among our people who would gladly return.

     NICK
     No, Daniel. Let me.

     DANIEL
     Nick.

     NICK
     This was my life's work. I've been hoping for another chance at this
     for twenty-nine years. Please.

     DANIEL
     You just came back into my life.

     NICK
     I'll be back again.

     GIANT ALIEN

     (to the others)
     Look again into the eyes of the skull.

     O'NEILL
     Well, Nick...take notes.

     NICK
     I will.

   [Carter waves goodbye as she and O'Neill head towards the skull.]

     DANIEL
     You have to tell me everything.

     NICK

     I promise.
     (He places his hands on Daniel's shoulders.)
     Daniel, I am proud of you.

     DANIEL

     Goodbye... (he smiles)
     Grandpa.

   FADE OUT

   THE END
