   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 22

   [Carter walks up to the elevator and passes her card key through to
   call it. In a moment, the doors open, and inside are Jonas and an
   attractive nurse, Lieutenant Rush, just finishing a conversation. Both
   are smiling like they've been laughing at something. Rush steps out.]

     RUSH

     (to Jonas)
     I'm sure I'll see you again.

   [Carter enters the elevator.]

     JONAS
     Hey, with any luck I'll get sick.

   [Rush smiles at that and walks away. Carter rolls her eyes as the doors
   close.]

     CARTER
     "With any luck, I'll get sick?"

     JONAS
     Lieutenant Rush is a nurse. She works in the infirmary.

     CARTER
     So you were...flirting?

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [The elevator doors open, and they both exit.]

     JONAS
     Well, I'm thinking of asking her out.

     CARTER
     Then you should.

     JONAS
     In Kelowna, it's common for that request to be passed on by a
     friend.

   [He punches Carter in the arm playfully.]

     CARTER
     Oh, it is not.

     JONAS
     Well, you could at least find out for me if she'd be receptive.

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     Jonas, you are such a chickensh...

   [Klaxons blare.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [Jonas and Carter both turn and rush to the control room.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter and Jonas approach Harriman's station.]

     CARTER
     Who is it?

     HARRIMAN
     The Russian team, Major, and they're requesting a medical team.

     CARTER
     Open the iris. Page General Hammond and Colonel O'Neill to the Gate
     room.

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Russian team, SG-4, comes through the active wormhole. With them
   is an ill human alien in tattered clothing, Alebran.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     JONAS
     I thought aliens weren't allowed back to the SGC without prior
     permission?

     CARTER
     They're not.

   [They both exit the control room.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The SFs remain standing at alert as O'Neill enters the Gate room ahead
   of a medical team with a gurney. Jonas and Carter stand there with SG-4
   and Alebran. Carter looks annoyed.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter? What's going on?

     CARTER
     Colonel Evanov and his team brought this visitor back with them,
     sir.

     O'NEILL
     Sergei, who the hell is that?

     ALEBRAN
     I am Alebran.

     EVANOV
     Alebran has vital information regarding the Goa'uld Nirrti.

     O'NEILL
     What about her?

     ALEBRAN

     (speaking with difficulty)
     She is experimenting on my people, transforming us.

     EVANOV
     I knew you would want to know what Nirrti was doing to these people,
     since it was you who allowed her to go free.

   [O'Neill looks at Evanov coldly.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Hammond and Fraiser enter the Gate room from the other doorway.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, what's going on?

     O'NEILL
     Old Sergei brought this guy back from 367 without authorization,
     sir.

     HAMMOND
     You'd better have a damn good reason.

     EVANOV
     General, sir, Alebran and his people are innocent victims of Nirrti.
     I felt certain you would wish to act.

     ALEBRAN
     Colonel Evanov has promised you would help us.

     O'NEILL

     (bitterly)
     Has he now?

   [Alebran winces and shudders from pain. Fraiser notices.]

     FRAISER

     (to Alebran)
     Are you in pain?

     ALEBRAN

     (swallowing)
     It is nothing that I cannot endure. Please, I must know if you will
     help my people.

     FRAISER
     Sir, with your permission, I'd like to take him to Isolation Room
     Three.

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

     FRAISER
     Come with me.

   [Fraiser leads Alebran away.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM THREE

   [Alebran reclines on a gurney, sipping some water. Fraiser and other
   medical staff look at charts and work nearby. Hammond, SG-4, and SG-1
   surround the gurney.]

     EVANOV
     We found him near the Stargate after we performed a recon of
     Nirrti's fortress, or I should say, he found us. Alebran has asked
     for our help to save his people being held prisoner inside.

     ALEBRAN
     I thought that she was helping us. Then I saw one of my people die
     in such a horrible way I realized. When I questioned her methods,
     she released me.

     JONAS
     She let you go?

     ALEBRAN

     (speaking with difficulty)
     I was well enough to return home, she said. When I arrived back in
     the village, everyone was dead. She lied to us. Those of us she took
     away, we were the last of our people. She was using us.

     O'NEILL
     You look okay to me.

     ALEBRAN
     Please, do not be fooled by my appearance. I spent just as much time
     within the machine as the others. I know that I have been changed.
     Inside I am not like I was before.

     CARTER
     What kind of machine?

     ALEBRAN
     It's one that sees inside of us. It allows her to manipulate that
     which we are made of.

     FRAISER
     If he's talking about some sort of machine that can directly alter
     human DNA in real time...

     TEAL'C
     You believe Nirrti is attempting to create a hok'taur.

     EVANOV
     I am not familiar with that term.

     JONAS
     It means advanced human.

     TEAL'C
     Nirrti is most interested in creating the perfect human host in
     order to increase her power.

     O'NEILL
     So, she's at it again.

     CARTER
     No, sir. This is worse.

     FRAISER
     Sam's right. Up to now, Nirrti's been using eugenics. Like with
     Cassandra's people, selectively breeding only those that
     demonstrated specific genetic attributes.

     CARTER
     With a machine that can alter DNA and a population with which to
     experiment, Nirrti could create a new host or even alter the DNA of
     her current one.

     FRAISER
     A Goa'uld with the powers of a hok'taur.

     JONAS
     Obviously we can't let that happen.

     EVANOV
     As you know, Nirrti does not have the power and resources of the
     other Goa'uld. She has only a small number of Jaffa in her service.
     I believe her capture, or if necessary, her assassination is quite
     possible.

     O'NEILL

     (to Hammond)
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Agreed.

     O'NEILL
     Can you get us in that fortress?

     ALEBRAN
     No. I cannot go back.

     HAMMOND
     We're offering to help your people, Alebran.

     ALEBRAN
     No, there is no time. I feel it. Something's happening.

     EVANOV
     Alebran believes Nirrti has the power to kill him even here.

     JONAS
     Well, what if she does?

     CARTER

     (suddenly realizing)
     Cassandra.

     FRAISER

     (exchanging a look with Carter)
     General, we need to find out if Alebran has a device similar to the
     one Nirrti placed in Cassandra.

     O'NEILL
     You mean like a bomb?

     HAMMOND
     Go.

     FRAISER

     (to staff)
     Let's get him into x-ray. Let's move.

     ALEBRAN
     No, it's too late.

     FRAISER
     Breathe deeply. Let's go. Move. Come on, let's move! Take it easy.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 22

   [Fraiser and her team rush the gurney through the corridor, the others
   swiftly follow.]

     EVANOV
     What is happening?

     CARTER
     Several years ago, Nirrti placed a naquadah device inside a young
     girl in order to destroy the SGC.

     EVANOV
     My team can take him back through the Stargate.

     CARTER
     No. These devices are designed to detonate in close proximity to the
     Stargate.

     ALEBRAN
     You have to kill me.

     FRAISER
     Just take it easy.

     ALEBRAN
     Kill me. Kill me now!

     FRAISER
     Give him a sedative. Two ccs valium.

     ALEBRAN
     Please, someone tell me what is happening?

     FRAISER
     Alebran, we need to take a chest x-ray.

     ALEBRAN
     Noooo!

     FRAISER
     Get him down.

     ALEBRAN
     No! Please kill me! Aaaah!

   [Alebran screams in agony and starts to turn red, his blood vessels
   appearing large and prominent. He starts to spit clear liquid and has a
   seizure.]

     FRAISER
     Everybody get back!

   [O'Neill takes an SF's Beretta from the man's holster and aims it at
   Alebran. The seizure stops, and more water comes out of Alebran's
   mouth. His entire body is severely bloated. Suddenly he deflates, then
   explodes into clear fluid that cascades over the gurney and onto the
   floor. Everyone steps back a bit more, looking very disturbed.]

     EVANOV
     [speaking Russian]

     JONAS
     What happened?

   [Hammond moves to the base intercom and presses the button.]

     HAMMOND

     (into intercom)
     This is Hammond. I want a hazmat team to Level 22 elevators
     immediately.

     FRAISER
     It's like every cell in his body just broke down.

     CARTER
     Nirrti must have written some kind of time delay right into his DNA.

     FRAISER

     (shaking her head)
     There's nothing we could have done, sir.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Hammond, O'Neill and Evanov walk down the hall.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, how soon can your team be ready?

     O'NEILL
     Right away, sir. I'd like to take SG-3 with me as back up.

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

     EVANOV
     Allow my team to join SG-1, General.

     O'NEILL

     (rolling his eyes)
     I don't think so, Sergei.

     HAMMOND
     Not so fast, Colonel.

   [O'Neill stops and turns.]

     O'NEILL
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Lieutenant Colonel Evanov's team has gathered valuable intelligence
     that could be useful to you.

     EVANOV
     My team has scouted the entire area, sir. I can get you right inside
     Nirrti's fortress.

     O'NEILL

     (sighing)
     Fine. Get geared up.

     EVANOV
     Thank you.

     O'NEILL
     General.

     HAMMOND
     Like it or not a Russian team is operating out of the SGC. I've been
     asked to integrate them more fully into our own operations.

     O'NEILL
     Does it have to be with my team?

     HAMMOND
     Lieutenant Colonel Evanov is a fine officer. I'm sure you'll agree.
     You'll be in command.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir...I'll remind him of that.

   EXT--NIRRTI'S PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1 and SG-4 exit the active Stargate, weapons at ready.]

     EVANOV
     So, this is the path leading to the fortress. Guarded by Jaffa.

     O'NEILL
     Not many.

     EVANOV
     Only ten.

   [They pause.]

     O'NEILL
     All right. Evanov, you're with us.

     EVANOV
     [Speaks Russian to his team]

   EXT--NIRRTI'S FORTRESS, DAY

   [Nirrti's fortress is nestled halfway up a mountain. Two crescent moons
   are visible in the sky.]

   [SG-1 and Evanov move quietly through the forest. They crouch at the
   edge of an incline and spread out. O'Neill takes out his monocular and
   studies the Jaffa guard positions.]

     CARTER
     They're well positioned.

     O'NEILL
     We're gonna need a diversion. Carter, Jonas, that's you.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [Carter and Jonas move away.]

   [Later, a Jaffa paces on his patrol. Nearby, but out of sight, Carter
   and Jonas set C-4 explosives. O'Neill and the others get ready. Carter
   times herself, then detonates some of the explosives. The Jaffa turn at
   the detonation, then are distracted again as she fires her P-90.]

     JAFFA
     Kree, Jaffa!

   [A firefight ensues. Teal'c takes over a Jaffa cannon, firing at
   another Jaffa position and downing some Jaffa. One Jaffa breaks away
   and starts to run to raise the alert. Evanov, next to Teal'c, spots
   him.]

     EVANOV

     (into radio to O'Neill)
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     I got him.

   [O'Neill aims his rifle and downs the fleeing Jaffa with one shot.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Evanov, stay out here for now. Watch our six.

     EVANOV

     (into radio)
     Yes, sir.

   [Evanov takes over manning the Jaffa cannon from Teal'c, who joins his
   teammates.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S FORTRESS

   [SG-1, in staggered formation, sweep through the compound. Carter spots
   some natives cowering in fear.]

     CARTER

     (whispering and gesturing)
     Colonel.

     WODAN
     Please, don't hurt us...

     JONAS
     We're not here to hurt anyone. We've come here to rescue you. Take
     you from this place.

     WODAN
     No, no, we cannot leave.

     O'NEILL

     One step at a time here, Jonas.
     (to Wodan)
     Where's Nirrti?

     WODAN
     She is not here.

     CARTER
     Are you expecting her back?

     WODAN
     Of course. For our treatments.

     JONAS
     My name is Jonas.

     WODAN
     I am Wodan.

   [Wodan lowers his head. Though in essence human, he is extremely
   deformed, and the team is taken aback at his appearance.]

     JONAS
     We've come from a place called Earth. To help, all of you.

   [The others also come into the light. They are equally deformed.]

     WODAN
     That is not necessary. Nirrti is helping us.

   [O'Neill lowers his weapon.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     WODAN
     She cares for us. Nirrti is our god.

     TEAL'C
     Nirrti is of a race called the Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     They're parasitical beings that use our kind as hosts.

     WODAN
     We are very ill. Nirrti is curing us of our sickness.

     TEAL'C
     That is most unlikely.

     WODAN
     When the god Nirrti came, a great plague had befallen our people. We
     were dying. With the machine, Nirrti has kept us alive.

   [Wodan gestures to a device in one of the rooms.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Check it out.
     (to Wodan)
     Don't take this wrong, friend. If this is cured...

   [O'Neill huffs and shakes his head, unsure how to continue.]

     WODAN
     My brother Alebran once looked as I do now. In time she made him
     whole again.

     O'NEILL

     (biting his lip)
     Alebran you say?

     TEAL'C
     Your brother is dead.

     WODAN
     Nirrti allowed him to return to our village.

     JONAS
     There's no one left alive at your village. Alebran told us himself.

     WODAN

     (upset)
     Wha...?

     O'NEILL

     Might have been a different Alebran. It's a popular name.
     (gives warning looks to Teal'c and Jonas)
     The point is, we need to know exactly when and where Nirrti's coming
     back.

     EGAR
     Very soon. And when she comes, she will punish you.

     JONAS
     Your people were never sick. Nirrti's been lying to you.

     WODAN

     (in disbelief)
     No. No, the plague ravaged our people long before she came. Our
     village was almost wiped out.

     TEAL'C
     It is possible she discovered them in this condition and took
     advantage of their situation.

     EGAR
     She brought me to this place. She gave me back my life.

     CARTER
     You said Nirrti would be returning for your treatments? What would
     happen to you if you didn't get them?

     WODAN
     We would die.

     EGAR
     We must receive treatment by tomorrow.

     CARTER
     Their mutations might be unstable.

     JONAS
     So what happened to Alebran will most likely happen to them too if
     they don't go back in that machine.

     CARTER
     Sir, this is an incredibly advanced piece of technology. My guess is
     that it was built by the Ancients.

     O'NEILL
     Can you figure it out?

     CARTER
     Not by tomorrow. Maybe with a few days and a lot of help. We're
     gonna need Nirrti, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (unhappy)
     Yeah. Figure out what you can. I'm gonna go brief Evanov. Jonas,
     Teal'c, take these fine folks someplace where they can be
     comfortable for a while.

     EGAR

     (low, to Wodan)
     He intends to kill her.

   [O'Neill overhears and turns.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     EGAR
     You are planning to kill Nirrti.

     WODAN
     Are you certain, Egar?

     EGAR
     Yes, even now.

     O'NEILL

     (cautiously)
     No. First I intend to ask her in the nicest possible way to undo
     what she's done to you folks. You're just gonna have to trust me. We
     came here to help you.

     WODAN
     Only because you believe you are responsible for what has happened
     to us.

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     Do what you can.

   EXT--JAFFA CANNON STATION, NIRRTI'S PLANET, DAY

     EVANOV
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Nirrti's not home.

     EVANOV
     She must have left while we were on Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Well apparently she's coming back. I want to set up an ambush.

     EVANOV
     I will inform my men.

     O'NEILL
     Your team will be our back up. And we have to take her alive. Right
     now she's the only one who knows how to run that machine in there.

     EVANOV
     Very well.

     O'NEILL
     By the way, did you talk to any of the people in there other than
     Alebran?

     EVANOV
     No. Why?

     O'NEILL
     Probably nothing. I'll relieve you in two hours.

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [Egar and Wodan lead Teal'c and Jonas down a spiral staircase where
   many other deformed villagers loiter near cells with metal bars. Jonas
   and Teal'c look around with concern.]

     JONAS
     This is where you sleep?

     WODAN
     Yes.

   [Wodan raises his arm, and the iron bars to the cells rise. The other
   villagers shrink behind Wodan and Egar in fear.]

     JONAS
     How did you..?

     EGAR
     We cannot allow you to harm Nirrti.

   [Teal'c and Jonas raise their weapons defensively.]

     TEAL'C
     We have no quarrel with your people. But I must insist you enter
     this cage.

   [Wodan pulls his arm back. Teal'c's staff and Jonas's P-90 are yanked
   out of their hands. Both reach for their sidearms, but Wodan
   telekinetically yanks again and the Beretta and zat also are pulled
   away from the team members.]

   [The pair attempt to bodily rush the group but are held back. Wodan
   lowers his arm and Jonas and Teal'c are forced to floor.]

     WODAN
     And I must insist the same of you.

   [He sweeps his arm to one side, and the pair slide on their backs into
   the two cells. With another gesture, Wodan lowers the cell doors again.
   Jonas and Teal'c are allowed to sit up, but Wodan yanks their radios
   from their vests telekinetically before they can alert anyone.]

     JONAS
     Wodan, you're making a mistake!

     WODAN
     No, it is you who has made the mistake, Jonas. She is coming.

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

   [Carter studies the controls of the Ancient device.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Jonas, I'm already stymied here; I could really use your help.
     (after a pause)
     Jonas? Colonel, Jonas isn't responding on his radio.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Understood. Jonas? Teal'c? Evanov, this is SG-1 Niner. Come in.
     (after a pause with no response)
     Carter, stay put, I'm on my way.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [Carter readies her zat and looks around warily. Nearby, rings
   activate. She primes her weapon as two Jaffa appear. Carter shoots them
   both before they can ready their weapons. Carter approaches. As she
   starts to disarm them, she is downed by a zat blast from behind. Nirrti
   becomes visible after deactivating her personal cloaking device and
   glares at Carter.]

   [O'Neill cautiously sweeps the fortress, his P-90 at ready. From behind
   cover, he spots Nirrti kneeling and holding an unconscious Carter at
   zat point, waiting for him.]

     NIRRTI
     I'm sure you're aware that a second shot from this weapon will kill.

     O'NEILL
     This weapon kills on the first shot.

     NIRRTI
     Then why haven't you already fired?

     O'NEILL
     Because I need you alive.

     NIRRTI
     You?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I know, it's kinda hard to believe. But I need you to help
     these people.

     NIRRTI
     But I am helping them.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I can see that.

     NIRRTI
     Appearances can be deceiving, Colonel O'Neill.

   [She looks down at one of her Jaffa. He sits up suddenly. When he spots
   O'Neill, the Jaffa raises his staff, but O'Neill shoots first. The
   bullet stops inches from the Jaffa's chest. O'Neill blinks in surprise,
   as does the Jaffa. Nirrti smirks. To one side, Wodan can be seen
   holding the bullet at bay before letting it fall harmlessly to the
   floor.]

     NIRRTI
     Now, as I said...

   [O'Neill considers his options and grimaces.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [He lowers his weapon slowly. Nirrti aims her zat at him and fires.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [O'Neill wakes up on a cot.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

   [Carter is sitting nearby.]

     CARTER
     Sir.

     O'NEILL

     (sitting up)
     I really, really don't like that woman.

     CARTER

     (sighing)
     Yes, sir.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

   [O'Neill turns and sees Jonas and Teal'c imprisoned with them.]

     O'NEILL
     This is an unpleasant surprise.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [O'Neill approaches the bars, checking they're not energized before
   testing their sturdiness. Jodan stands and approaches.]

     JONAS
     Wodan's telekinetic. Took our weapons right out of our hands just by
     thinking it.

     TEAL'C
     Nirrti is clearly progressing in her attempt to create a hok'taur.

     JONAS
     Maybe we're too late.

     CARTER
     No, these genetic manipulations are unstable. She's not there yet.

     JONAS
     Egar's telepathic. He did know Colonel O'Neill intended on killing
     Nirrti.

     O'NEILL

     (defensively)
     That was not my intention.

     CARTER
     Who knows what abilities these others possess? I mean, enhanced
     senses, superhuman strength.

   [O'Neill looks over at the other villagers huddled outside their
   cells.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey folks, how you doing? Jack O'Neill, Earth. Listen, originally we
     came here to rescue you. But as you can see we've run into a bit of
     a snag. So if any of you can bend steel with your bare hands or
     happen to be more powerful than a locomotive, just raise your hand.
     Identify yourselves. Let us know where you are.

   [The villagers do nothing as SG-1 looks around awkwardly.]

     JONAS

     (wryly)
     Must not know what a locomotive is.

   [Wodan and Egar approach. Egar half-carries Evanov.]

     O'NEILL
     Woodman, buddy. Listen, I think we're dealing with a bit of a
     misunderstanding here.

     CARTER
     Do you really think Nirrti will keep you alive with these powers
     after she's finished her experiments? She's using you.

   [Wodan raises the cell doors to O'Neill's surprise. Egan drops Evanov
   to the floor and shoves him inside. O'Neill and Carter drag him to the
   cot.]

     O'NEILL
     What'd she do to him?

     WODAN

     (pointing at Carter)
     You are next.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, I think I'm next.

     WODAN
     Nirrti has asked for this one.

     O'NEILL
     And I'm asking for you to take me inst...

     WODAN
     No!

   [Wodan telekinetically shoves O'Neill back. O'Neill rubs his chest at
   the pressure.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, look. If you really can see in my mind, you know we came
     here to help you.

     EGAR
     I did sense that when you first arrived. But when I looked deeper
     into your mind I realized you would sacrifice us all if necessary to
     destroy Nirrti.

     O'NEILL
     That's not true.

     EGAR

     You cannot lie to me.
     (to Carter)
     Come!

   [Carter exits the cell and turns back to O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     At least I'll find out how the machine works.

   [Her teammates worriedly watch her be led away.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

   [Nirrti studies a crystal as Carter and her escort arrive.]

     NIRRTI
     Major Carter. I am pleased to have such an excellent subject. I
     might even consider you for my new host.

     CARTER
     Over my dead body.

     NIRRTI

     (chuckling)
     True, that is far more likely. Now, step inside.

   [Carter hesitates, but with a look at Wotan, complies. The device
   activates; holographic projections of DNA chromosomes surround Carter.]

     NIRRTI
     Now, let's see what you're made of.

   [A different setting activates and Carter becomes rigid, appearing to
   be in pain.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

     EVANOV
     Colonel. I'm sorry. I should never have allowed myself to be
     captured.

     O'NEILL
     Did you get a message off to your team?

     EVANOV
     No. I tried. But my radio...

     O'NEILL
     Yanked right out of your hand?

     EVANOV
     Da. And then, at the same moment I was struck by a zat'nik'atel that
     appeared from nowhere. My team would follow their standing orders to
     return to base if we were out of contact for this long.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps General Hammond will send reinforcements?

     O'NEILL
     Hopefully it won't come to that. What'd they do to you up there?

     EVANOV
     I don't know for how long I was in the machine or what she did, but
     something is different.

     O'NEILL
     We'll get out of this.

     EVANOV

     (looking around)
     Where is Major Carter?

   [SG-1 looks grim.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

   [Nirrti shuts down the machine. Carter is drenched in sweat.]

     NIRRTI
     Enough. She has served her purpose. Bring me the one called Jonas.

   [Carter collapses as Wotan and Egar drag her away bodily.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [Egar half carries Carter as Wodan raises the cell door. She barely
   moves of her own accord as O'Neill grabs her and pulls her into the
   cell.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on.

   [Their cell door closes and they move away.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey fellas! Want to do me a favor? Go on back, let her know that I'm
     next, you should pick me.

     WODAN
     Her will is my command.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well...there's your mistake right there.

     EGAR
     Jonas.

   [Wodan opens Jonas and Teal'c's cell door. Jonas starts to move
   forward, then rushes Egar, catching him by surprise and throttling him
   against the wall. Teal'c tries to press their advantage, but Wodan
   moves quickly and slams the cell door shut. Teal'c tries to keep it
   open bodily, but Wodan's mind power is too great. The door slams closed
   and Teal'c is shoved to the floor. Wodan turns to Jonas and Egar as
   Jonas is about to punch the man. Jonas's punch is stopped
   telekinetically.]

     JONAS

     (to Egar while fighting against Wodan's will)
     You didn't see that coming, did you?

   [Finally Wodan is able to shove Jonas aside. Egar regains his breath.]

     WODAN

     (to Teal'c, angrily)
     Do not attempt that again.

   [Jonas shakes off the pain and lets himself be led away.]

   [O'Neill turns to Carter. She is weak and trembling.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER

     (with difficulty)
     Sir.

     O'NEILL
     You made it through. You're gonna be all right.

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     No, sir. I don't think I am.

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

     NIRRTI
     We have not met.

     JONAS
     No, but I have heard a lot about you.

     NIRRTI
     You are not human.

     JONAS
     Oh, I'm human. I'm just not from Earth. A Goa'uld like yourself took
     my ancestors from Earth thousands of years ago and enslaved them.

     NIRRTI
     Sadly, it was not I.

   [Nirrti activates the machine and is intrigued by what she sees. She
   changes the setting. Jonas is not in pain as the device scans him.]

     NIRRTI
     Those few thousand years on another world have changed you more than
     you know.

   [Jonas studies Nirrti.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [Evanov coughs.]

     CARTER
     You in pain?

     EVANOV

     (nodding)
     Something is happening. I can feel it. Is there water?

     O'NEILL
     We'll ask.

     CARTER
     Try to rest.

   [Teal'c approaches from his cell.]

     TEAL'C
     I have been attempting to communicate with the other prisoners, but
     they also believe Nirrti is a god. They will not listen.

     O'NEILL
     He's in pretty bad shape.

     TEAL'C
     He appears to be suffering the same symptoms as Alebran.

     O'NEILL
     We got to get to that guy...what's his name?

     TEAL'C
     Wodan.

     O'NEILL
     No, the other one.

     CARTER
     Egar.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I mean if he can read my mind, why can't he read Nirrti's?

     CARTER
     He can't read minds all the time. Otherwise he would have known
     Jonas was gonna jump him.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps he is afraid to look into the mind of one he perceives as a
     god.

   [Carter tries to suppress her increasing pain. O'Neill notices
   immediately.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     Nothing, I'm fine.

   [O'Neill clearly doesn't believe her.]

     O'NEILL
     Get some rest. That's an order.

   [Teal'c nods in agreement. Carter sighs and leans against O'Neill,
   closing her eyes.]

   [Behind them, Evanov starts coughing. Carter opens her eyes and turns.
   They witness Evanov "melting" the same way Alebran did.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S BEDCHAMBER

   [Jonas awakens on a mattress surrounded by pillows. Nirrti lounges on a
   chaise nearby.]

     JONAS

     (looking around)
     Why did you...bring me here?

     NIRRTI
     Because you are different.

   [Jonas sits up and holds his head.]

     JONAS
     How's that?

     NIRRTI
     You are much closer than the others. With my help you could complete
     the transformation.

     JONAS
     And end up looking like those others?

     NIRRTI

     (chuckling)
     No, I assure you. You must know that you are capable of much more
     than the petty tasks that life among the Tau'ri can offer.

   [Nirrti sits next to Jonas and wraps her arms around his shoulders.]

     JONAS
     Uh, I like my life the way it is.

     NIRRTI
     I could make you more powerful than you could imagine. The powers
     you have seen in Wodan and the others--only a fraction of what I
     could give you.

     JONAS
     Well, that is definitely the most interesting offer I've had in a
     very long time. But you can't risk giving me those kind of powers
     unless you're certain that I won't use them against you.

     NIRRTI

     (nuzzling his ear)
     Once I share those powers, we could rule the galaxy together.

     JONAS
     What about everyone else?

     NIRRTI
     Unnecessary.

     JONAS
     Well, I can only imagine what it would be like to have powers like
     that. What would I do? I guess the first thing I would do...would be
     to free my friends and all those other people you have caged up down
     there. And then I would destroy you. Not necessarily in that order,
     but you get the idea.

   [Nirrti punches Jonas in the head, and he falls to floor, groaning in
   pain. She signals for Wodan to enter.]

     NIRRTI

     Take him away and bring O'Neill.
     (to Jonas)
     Once you have seen what has already happened to the others, perhaps
     you will change your mind.

   [Jonas looks up; Nirrti's eyes flash.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [Jonas enters his cell and looks around.]

     JONAS
     Evanov?

     O'NEILL

     Dead.
     (raising his voice)
     Just like Alebran. Yeah that's right, Nirrti killed your brother. Go
     ahead; take a look in my mind if you don't believe me. Better yet,
     look into Nirrti's head.

   [Egar and Wodan exchange looks, but lower Jonas's cell door and move
   towards O'Neill's.]

     EGAR
     That is forbidden.

     O'NEILL
     No kidding.

     JONAS
     Because she's hiding something!

     EGAR
     She is a god. She would know.

     TEAL'C
     She would not know, because she is not a god.

   [Wodan raises O'Neill's cell door.]

     WODAN
     O'Neill is next.

   [O'Neill points to Evanov's empty cot.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, she just killed a good man. She's gonna do the same thing to
     the rest of us.

     JONAS
     Together you're stronger than she is, you just don't realize it.

   [Wodan pulls O'Neill towards the cell entrance telekinetically. O'Neill
   signals he'll cooperate, and he exits the cell on his own. Wodan closes
   the cell door.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, NIRRTI'S FORTRESS

     O'NEILL

     (to Wodan and Egar)
     You know, you're right. I did want to kill her. But if you look into
     her mind for a split second, you'd want to do the same thing for
     what she's done to your people.

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

     NIRRTI
     You should not have come here, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Can you undo what you've done to Carter?

     NIRRTI
     If I choose to.

     O'NEILL

     (bitterly)
     I let you go once. We made a deal; I honored it.

     NIRRTI
     I told you then I would not have done the same.

     O'NEILL
     Fix what you've done to Carter, let the rest of my team go, that's
     all I ask, and you can do whatever you want to me.

     NIRRTI
     Yes, Colonel. I can.

   [Nirrti looks down at her controls. O'Neill and Egar exchange glances.
   O'Neill gives Egar an encouraging look. Egar looks down, then his eyes
   widen in shock.]

     EGAR
     Stop! What he says is true!

   [Nirrti looks up in surprise.]

     WODAN
     My brother?

     EGAR
     She murdered him. She has murdered hundreds of our people. And she
     intends to do the same to us.

     NIRRTI
     Jaffa, kree!

   [Nirrti's Jaffa aim their weapons, but Wodan uses his powers to disarm
   them and then break their necks.]

     NIRRTI

     (desperately)
     I command you!

   [Wodan raises his arm. Nirrti begins to choke. She is lifted a few feet
   off the floor.]

     NIRRTI
     Wod...

     O'NEILL
     Stop.

     NIRRTI
     I am your god.

     O'NEILL
     We need her alive. Wodan, she's the only one who can help your
     people.

     NIRRTI

     (choking)
     I can make you more powerful than your wildest dreams.

   [With a quick gesture, Wodan snaps Nirrti's neck. She falls to the
   floor with a thud, her eyes flashing once before dulling forever.]

     O'NEILL

     (despairing)
     Why did you do that?

     WODAN
     She deserves to die.

     O'NEILL
     She was Carter's only chance!

     EGAR
     Not so O'Neill. Before she died, I looked into Nirrti's mind and
     took what I needed. Hurry, while there is still time.

   [Wodan and O'Neill rush back to the prison cells.]

   INT--NIRRTI'S PRISON

   [O'Neill and Wodan rush in. Wodan raises the cell doors to release
   everyone. O'Neill lifts the weakened Carter.]

     CARTER

     (bloated and barely conscious)
     Sir.

   INT--NIRRTI'S LAB

   [Carter stands inside the machine, looking perfectly healthy. The
   machine shuts down.]

     EGAR
     It is done. You are as you were before.

     CARTER
     Thank you.

   [O'Neill helps her off the platform.]

     O'NEILL
     Yes, thank you.

     WODAN
     We can all be as we were before now that you have shown us the
     truth.

     O'NEILL

     Hail Dorothy. The Wicked Witch is dead.
     (everyone looks at him)
     It's a movie...Margaret Hamilton.

     CARTER
     The point is, with Nirrti gone you can get back to your lives,
     rebuild your village.

     JONAS
     We can help you out with food and supplies, get you back on track.

     CARTER
     And once we get to know each other a little better, I'd really like
     a chance to study this machine.

   [Egar and Wodan exchange looks.]

     WODAN
     As soon as we have made our people whole again, we intend to destroy
     it.

     CARTER
     But-but this is an incredibly advanced piece of technology.

     O'NEILL

     (softly remonstrating)
     Carter, don't you think it would be for the best?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. I guess it would.

     O'NEILL

     To Oz.
     (O'Neill notices Wodan and Egar's confusion)
     Its...part of that movie.

   [SG-1 exits. Egar gestures for Wodan to step onto the device, which he
   does with a smile. The device activates.]

   FADE OUT
