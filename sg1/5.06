   INT--FRAISER'S HOUSE

   [Fraiser is lighting the last of some candles on a birthday cake. A
   message on the cake reads "Happy Birthday Cassandra." Opened presents
   can be seen on a table in the rear of the shot. The camera pans up to
   reveal Carter standing next to Fraiser, both out of uniform. Balloons
   and decorations garland the room.]

     FRAISER

     (shouting)
     Cassandra!
     (to Carter)
     I'm not imagining it, I mean she was here, was she not?

     CARTER
     Yeah! For almost the entire time she was opening her presents.

     FRAISER

     (shouting)
     Cassie!

     CASSANDRA

     (with attitude)
     What?

   [Cassandra enters, brushing her hair.]

     FRAISER
     I thought you were wearing the top that Sam bought you.

     CASSANDRA

     (wearing a tight fitting, yellow tank top type shirt)
     Oh! Well, that's like for school.

     CARTER

     Hey! (clears throat and gestures toward the cake)
     Make a wish!

     FRAISER
     Yeah.

     CASSANDRA
     Dominic's waiting.

     FRAISER
     Fine! Invite him in. I'm sure he'd like to have a piece of birthday
     cake that Sam went to all the trouble to bake.

     CARTER

     (softly, under her breath to Fraiser)
     Buy.

     FRAISER
     Bring!

     CARTER

     (cheerfully)
     I'd love to meet him.

     CASSANDRA

     (to Fraiser)
     You said I could go

     FRAISER
     Yeah, I did...after.

     CASSANDRA
     We're meeting a bunch of people.

     FRAISER

     (walking toward her)
     You know, considering that you have not been feeling well, I think
     you're just lucky I'm letting you go out at all.

   [Cassandra and Fraiser exchange stares.]

     CASSANDRA

     (pointedly)
     Fine!

   [She turns and leaves the room.]

     CARTER
     You know, I could just...

     FRAISER

     (putting up her hand)
     Uuuhhh...she is going to have a piece of birthday cake, you stay
     right where you are.

   [She picks up Cassandra's brush and throws it down; cheerfully.]

     FRAISER
     Coffee?

     CARTER
     Yes please.

   EXT--FRAISER'S PORCH, NIGHT

   [Dominic is waiting on the porch.]

     CASSANDRA

     (walking outside)
     They're not letting me leave yet, so, I mean if you want to meet up
     with everybody then--

     DOMINIC
     Wait a second...here. Happy Birthday.

   [He hands her a box. She looks at him, smiles and opens it. Inside is a
   pyramid shaped prism.]

     CASSANDRA
     It's just like the ones from class.

     DOMINIC
     Yeah, well, you...you said it was pretty, so...This one's for
     decoration, so...I thought you could put it in your room.

   [Cassandra holds it up to the light overhead, and a rainbow of light
   shines on Dominic's face. He smiles, steps up to her, and they kiss.
   The porch light flickers as they are kissing. Brief shot of Fraiser and
   Carter inside with the flickering lights. Then the outside light
   explodes and falls down. Cassandra is seen falling back from Dominic.]

     DOMINIC
     Cassandra?

   [Carter and Fraiser are shown inside drinking coffee.]

     DOMINIC
     Help!

   [Carter and Fraiser run outside. Cassandra is seen lying unconscious on
   the floor. Fraiser bends down, feeling her forehead.]

     CARTER

     (to Dominic)
     What happened?!

     DOMINIC
     Nothing! She just fell.

     FRAISER

     She's running a temperature.
     (to Dominic)
     What was she doing when she "just fell"?

     DOMINIC
     I...I kissed her.

     CARTER
     You kissed her?

     DOMINIC

     It's her birthday, all right?
     (panicked)
     Look, I'm telling you! The light just exploded, and she
     just...passed out! That's what happened!

     FRAISER
     I want to get her to the infirmary.

     CARTER
     I'll get the car keys.

   [She goes inside.]

     FRAISER
     Cass? Baby? Cassie? Cassie?

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Cassandra remains unconscious on the bed. Carter is sitting with her.]

     O'NEILL
     How's she doing?

     CARTER

     (faces him)
     Her fever still hasn't come down.

     FRAISER

     (walking in)
     Sam? I need to get a sample of your blood. Cassandra's bloodwork
     shows the presence of a retrovirus.

     O'NEILL
     Didn't she just get over the flu?

     FRAISER
     Well, whatever this is it isn't the flu.

     CARTER
     You think there's a causal relationship between the retrovirus and
     the EM field?

     FRAISER
     Possibly.

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     What?

     CARTER
     Cassandra's body is somehow generating a low level electromagnetic
     field that's periodically spiking. That could be why the light
     exploded on the porch.

     FRAISER
     And why I can't do an MRI to find out what other effects this
     retrovirus is having.

   [Cassandra slowly wakes up. She is groggy.]

     CASSANDRA
     Mom?

     FRAISER
     I'm here.

     CASSANDRA
     I couldn't finish the harvest.

     FRAISER

     (glances back at Carter)
     That's OK.

     CASSANDRA
     I have to go into the forest.

     CARTER
     It's OK, Cassie.

   [Fraiser prepares an injection. The lights in the infirmary flicker,
   and Cassandra loses consciousness.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c, Carter, O'Neill and Fraiser are seated at the table.]

     HAMMOND
     Do I need to put the base under quarantine?

     FRAISER
     I don't think it's contagious, Sir. Major Carter and I show no
     evidence of the retrovirus in our blood.

     HAMMOND
     Then where did Cassandra contract it?

     FRAISER
     I'm guessing her home planet.

     TEAL'C
     Cassandra has not been to that planet in several years.

     FRAISER
     Retroviruses can exist in the body for years undetected before the
     symptoms first appear. When it does emerge, it starts to rewrite the
     individual's DNA in order to replicate. I've compared this one with
     every retrovirus on record, and it doesn't match any of them.

     CARTER
     So, there's obviously no vaccine.

     FRAISER

     (shakes head)
     I've been giving her antiviral medications, but the most recent
     tests show it's spread to her cerebral spinal fluid. At this moment,
     I'm more concerned about brain damage.

     DANIEL

     (walking in)
     I just finished going through SG-7's, er, reports from P8X-987...

     O'NEILL
     Morning.

     DANIEL

     (looking up)
     Morning! In the three months on Cassandra's planet, SG-7 witnessed 2
     instances of high fever and hallucination in teenagers Cassandra's
     age. The villagers called it the mind fire, I found some digital
     video footage...

   [Daniel turns on a nearby monitor.]

   [SG-7 can be seen rushing to a young girl, around Cassandra's age, who
   is seizing in the grass. Villagers off camera can be heard asking what
   is wrong. The girl is in obvious pain. After a few seconds, Daniel
   turns it off. The group at the table is obviously shaken by the
   images.]

     DANIEL
     There's more but you, er, get the idea.

     CARTER
     How did they treat it?

     DANIEL
     SG-7 offered medicine, but the village elders believed that these
     children were touched by the gods, and that interfering would tempt
     retribution.

     O'NEILL
     What happened to them?

     DANIEL
     They were sent alone in the forest near the village.

   [Fraiser looks at Carter when she hears "forest".]

     DANIEL
     And after several days they came back...cured.

     HAMMOND
     How?

     DANIEL
     SG-7 tried to find out, but the elders insisted the child had to
     make the journey alone as some sort of religious rite.

     FRAISER
     Cassandra talked about going into the forest.

     O'NEILL
     She was delirious.

     CARTER
     Well, it's worth checking out, Sir.

     TEAL'C
     When we were last on P8X-987, the atmosphere had been contaminated
     by the Goa'uld Nirrti.

     CARTER
     Well, that...that was four years ago. The toxin could be non
     persistent. We can send a MALP to be sure.

     O'NEILL
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     It's worth a try.

   [The team exchange worried glances.]

   EXT--WORMHOLE

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, SUNSET

   [The team are seen walking away from the Gate.]

   EXT--ALIEN FOREST

   [The display from Daniel's video camera is seen. A tree on the screen
   has some strange glowing markings on it.]

     DANIEL

     (off screen)
     Well, there's something.

   [Daniel steps into view. The rest of the team follow him toward the
   strange tree.]

     O'NEILL
     It's a handprint.

   [A green handprint is shown on a tree.]

     TEAL'C
     A fire burned here.

     CARTER
     Maybe we should collect some samples of the local vegetation. I mean
     it's possible there might be a natural cure around here.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah! Let's collect some of that flora.

   [Daniel puts his hand over the print and lightly presses. A fire
   appears in the spot that previously had just ashes.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello.

   [O'Neill walks over to where Teal'c is standing next to the fire. A
   ring transporter is activated.]

   INT--ALIEN LAB

   [O'Neill and Teal'c begin to look around.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Carter? Daniel?

     TEAL'C
     I believe we are in a Goa'uld laboratory.

     O'NEILL
     Whose do you think?

     TEAL'C
     Nirrti.

     O'NEILL

     (nods)
     Yeah.

   [Another ring transport occurs. O'Neill brings up his weapon, but the
   transport is of Carter and Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     It's okay, it's just ... it's us.

   [O'Neill nods again and lowers his weapon.]

     CARTER
     So, where are we?

     TEAL'C
     I believe we are in the laboratory of Nirrti.

   [Daniel looks around, and picks up a stone plate, similar to one of
   Ma'chello's inventions. It is a Goa'uld notebook.]

     CARTER
     You know, Sir. This is where the children ended up...

     DANIEL

     (looking at the notebook)
     You're right about that.

     O'NEILL
     She didn't finish her sentence.

     DANIEL
     This place is what the initiation rite was all about. Hank'an
     children suffering from the mind fever wander into the forest, it
     gets dark, they are drawn to the handprint on the tree, then to the
     warm fire, and the rings sweep them to this lab.

     CARTER
     And then they come back cured.

     O'NEILL
     Nirrti cured them?

     CARTER
     Yeah, it makes sense.

     O'NEILL
     No, it doesn't.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. It seems a plausible explanation.

     O'NEILL
     No! She killed everyone on this planet, except Cassie. Why would she
     cure a bunch of kids?

     DANIEL
     Well, if I'm reading this right, it was part of some sort of
     experiment she was conducting.

     O'NEILL
     Now, See? That sounds like a Goa'uld.

     TEAL'C
     The last we saw of Nirrti, she was a prisoner of the System Lords.

     DANIEL
     Which means she's in no position to help us even if she...would.

   [He touches something making the centre of the table he is standing at
   rise. Inside is contained a numbers of clear crystal rods with
   different lines on them, resembling a DNA fingerprint.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, boy. I did that.

   [Daniel picks up a crystal from the table before him. O'Neill looks at
   him with a raised eyebrow seeming to ask "what", Daniel shakes his head
   to say he is unsure. O'Neill looks at Carter, she does the same.]

     O'NEILL
     Let's take it with us.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser walks into Infirmary, picks up Cassandra's notes, and goes to
   check on her. She pulls back the curtain to find that Cassandra has
   left.]

     FRAISER
     Cassie?

   [She turns and sees Cassandra slowly walking in the hallway leading out
   of the infirmary.]

     FRAISER
     Cassandra? What are you doing?!

     CASSANDRA

     (weakly)
     I have to go...

     FRAISER
     Honey, you're not well enough to go anywhere!

   [Fraiser takes Cassandra's arm. Cassandra pulls it away.]

     CASSANDRA
     I have to go into the forest!

   [Fraiser comes round to face Cassandra.]

     FRAISER
     I need you to get back in bed, OK?

     CASSANDRA

     (with venom)
     You're not my mother!

     FRAISER
     Okaay, then what have I been to you these last few years?

     CASSANDRA

     (becoming agitated)
     You don't understand!

     FRAISER
     OK, listen to me...if nothing else, I am your doctor, Cassandra, now
     let's go!

   [She takes hold of her arms again.]

     CASSANDRA

     (pushing Fraiser off her)
     So what?

     FRAISER
     I care about what happens to you! Honey, Don't you know what you
     mean to me?

     CASSANDRA
     Don't you get it? It doesn't matter!

     FRAISER
     It's the only thing that matters, please! Let me try and help you.

     CASSANDRA
     You can't! If you wanna help me, then leave me alone!

     FRAISER
     OK! Just hear me out. Let's get you back into bed, and then we'll
     talk. OK? SG-1'll be back soon...

     CASSANDRA

     (pushing Fraiser into the wall)
     No! Leave me alone!

     FRAISER
     Cassie!

   [Cassandra runs into the elevator doors, and is caught by two airmen.
   They start to take/drag her back to the infirmary.]

     CASSANDRA

     (said quickly, in one breath)
     No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Let me go, let me go,
     let me go!

     FRAISER

     (tearfully)
     I can't do that!

   [Cassandra shakes off the guards.]

     CASSANDRA

     (screaming)
     You're killing me!

   [She holds her head as all the lights in the corridor behind Fraiser
   explode. An emergency red light flashes, as Fraiser is seen turning
   toward Cassandra in the flickering light.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Carter walks down the ramp from an active wormhole.]

     HAMMOND
     Major?

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill wanted me to report back, Sir. Daniel and Teal'c
     wanted more time to search the lab.

     HAMMOND
     Let's hope they find something.

     CARTER
     Is she getting worse?

   [They look at each other. There is a long pause.]

     HAMMOND
     You should see for yourself.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY/OBSERVATION DECK

   [Cassandra is asleep on a bed. Fraiser is seen looking at her through
   the observation window. Carter stands next to Fraiser.]

     FRAISER
     We had to move her in here.

     CARTER
     She's still running a fever?

     FRAISER
     Seems to have peaked, but her bloodwork says otherwise. There's no
     antibodies. No indication that her body's fighting this thing, just
     more retrovirus.

     CARTER
     Does she know what's happening to her?

     FRAISER
     She seems driven to go back to the planet. I don't know if that is
     instinctual or a side effect of this retrovirus.

     CARTER

     (sigh)
     What are we gonna tell her?

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY/ISOLATION ROOM

   [Cassandra is seen sleeping on the bed. A door opens behind her and
   Fraiser and Carter enter the room. Cassandra wakes at the sound of the
   door and turns to look at Fraiser.]

     FRAISER
     Hey, how are you feeling? Any better?

     CASSANDRA

     (coldly)
     Why are you keeping me in here?

     FRAISER
     We have to. Your body is generating something called an EM field,
     see?

   [She points to the monitors, which are blinking.]

     FRAISER
     You can see the effect it's having on the monitors here, so, this
     room is shielded from the rest of the base.

     CASSANDRA
     If you let me go back to the planet then that won't happen anymore.

     FRAISER
     That's not true.

     CASSANDRA
     You don't know that. You don't know anything. You're just keeping me
     here because you're afraid.

     CARTER
     We found the place where the initiation rite was supposed to happen.

     CASSANDRA
     Then let me go there.

     FRAISER
     We think the place in the forest that you've been feeling drawn to
     leads to a Goa'uld laboratory. One that belonged to Nirrti.

     CASSANDRA
     She killed everyone in my village.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     FRAISER
     She also tried to use you to kill all of us.

     CARTER
     We think she was using your initiation ritual to conduct experiments
     on the children of your planet.

     CASSANDRA
     Why?

     CARTER

     (shakes head)
     We don't know.

     FRAISER
     It's possible that the retrovirus you're carrying was part of her
     experiment.

     CASSANDRA
     Wh-What was the experiment?

     FRAISER
     All we know so far is that this retrovirus is changing the way your
     cells generate electrical fields. So, your body is generating heat,
     and your EEG is showing that your brain activity is increasing--

     CASSANDRA
     You...don't know why, do you?

   [Fraiser and Carter exchange worried glances.]

     CARTER
     No.

     CASSANDRA
     And now she's gone.

     CARTER
     Yes, she is.

     CASSANDRA
     So, we won't be able to stop it.

     FRAISER
     We didn't say that.

   INT--ALIEN LAB

   [A door on a panel is opened to reveal some sort of alien device.
   O'Neill takes it out of the compartment. Teal'c stands next to him,
   holding out a case ready to receive the device.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     What's this for?

     TEAL'C
     What do you think it is for?

   [O'Neill throws it in the case.]

     DANIEL

     (off screen)
     Evolution.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     Of the Ho...Hok .... Tar ...Hok'Tar...Teal'c, what is the Hok'Tar?

     TEAL'C
     I have not heard that word in many years .

     DANIEL
     Well, it's in reference to the children that underwent the
     initiation rites, so it obviously had something to do with the
     children ri-

   [He is interrupted by the sound of a ring transport, but no one
   appears.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello.

     DANIEL
     Oh, sorry, guys. I may have just done that.

     O'NEILL
     Do it again! It's time to go.

   [The three are seen leaving via the rings. Through a blu-ish haze. We
   are seeing from Nirrti's POV.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY/ISOLATION ROOM

   [Cassandra is on the bed, staring at the wall. Carter enters, carrying
   a chess set. She puts it on a table, and wheels the table over to
   Cassandra. She sits next to the bed. Cassandra ignores her.]

     CARTER
     Hey, Kiddo. It's Saturday.

     CASSANDRA

     (quietly)
     So?

     CARTER

     (setting up the chess game)
     So, every other Saturday, at least while I'm on Earth, we play
     chess. And since I'm on Earth, and it's Saturday...

     CASSANDRA
     I know what's happening to me.

     CARTER
     Oh, OK...What?

     CASSANDRA
     I'm changing...into something...and there's nothing you can do to
     stop it.

     CARTER
     Hmm...you know how me and your mom feel when someone issues a
     challenge like that.

     CASSANDRA
     Doctor Fraiser isn't my real mother. She died! When Nirrti poisoned
     my village.

     CARTER
     I know that. Janet knows that, too...and please! Don't call her
     Doctor Fraiser.

     CASSANDRA
     Why?

     CARTER
     Because she loves you, and she deserves better. We all love you for
     that matter.

     CASSANDRA
     That doesn't...change...anything.

     CARTER
     You're wrong about that.

     CASSANDRA
     It's different. I'm...different now. I can do things...

   [She holds out her hand, and the knight piece flies into her hand.]

     CARTER

     (amazed)
     How did you do that?

     CASSANDRA
     I just...thought it. I thought I wanted a knight, and it...flew into
     my hand. Jack calls 'em horses.

     CARTER

     (Smiles and looks away)
     Yeah, well, that's Colonel O'Neill for you.

     CASSANDRA
     He always pretends he's not as smart as he really is.

     CARTER
     You know, if you take a close look, they really are horses.

     CASSANDRA

     (looks straight at Carter)
     What do you see when you look at me now?

     CARTER
     I see you...and until your head starts spinning around, and probably
     even then, I will still see...you.

   [She strokes Cassandra's hair, then continues to set up the chess
   game.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The shot of Carter setting up the chess game is shown on a monitor.
   The camera pans round to show Hammond, O'Neill and Carter at the
   briefing room table.]

     HAMMOND
     How could she do that?

     O'NEILL
     Magnets. Magnets. Every one of those pieces has got a little tiny
     magnet at the bottom to...hold it on the board like when you're
     driving so they don't rattle off...anyway...every one of those
     magnets has a little electrical field around it. That's how she was
     able to manipulate it. Magnets.

   [Hammond is shown looking confused.]

     O'NEILL
     They do look like...horses.

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Fraiser, on the other side of the table, also look
   confused.]

     FRAISER

     (to Hammond)
     I have no idea how she was able to do it physiologically, Sir.

     DANIEL
     A-Actually, Teal'c filled me in on something that might explain
     that. Hok'Tar is actually a hybrid of two Goa'uld words...Hok, which
     means advanced, and Tar which I believe is a sort of slang...

     O'NEILL
     For...?

     TEAL'C
     Human.

     DANIEL
     So, essentially, it's an advanced human...Hok' Tau'ri. Anyway,
     Nirrti was studying the children of Hanka because she believed they
     were evolving into...Hok'Tar.

     HAMMOND
     So, you're saying Cassandra is becoming some form of advanced human?

     FRAISER
     And the retrovirus is the catalyst.

   [Daniel nods.]

     TEAL'C
     Such an advanced human will represent a powerful host for the
     Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     Which explains why Nirrti was performing the experiments.

     DANIEL
     And it also explains why she exterminated the entire population when
     we came on the scene. She didn't want her...experiment exposed.

     FRAISER
     Prior to our arrival on P8X-987, and for as long as SG-7 was there,
     none of the villagers exhibited advanced intelligence or the ability
     to manipulate EM fields.

     CARTER
     So, Nirrti created the retrovirus in an attempt to engineer her own
     host?

     FRAISER
     It seems almost inconceivable that anybody could do something like
     that.

     DANIEL
     Well, it never worked. According to all the reports, the children
     went into the forest sick, and came out well again. If this were
     some sort of...transformation or evolutionary process, somewhere
     along the line, it was stopped.

     TEAL'C
     By Nirrti.

     CARTER
     Why would she do that?

     FRAISER
     The retrovirus rewrites DNA. If the carrier died before they were
     able to pass on the altered genes to the next generation, evolution
     couldn't take place.

     CARTER
     So the experiment was long-term?

     TEAL'C
     With each generation getting closer to truly becoming Hok'Tar.

     DANIEL
     The question is how far along is Cassandra? I mean, what if she
     really is transforming into...something...else?

     O'NEILL
     She thinks so.

     FRAISER

     Whatever she believes, her fever is still rising. Admittedly more
     slowly, and she seems to be able to handle it better but...
     (quietly)
     I can't control it.

   [The team exchange worried glances.]

     HAMMOND
     Let's find the answers...dismissed!

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY/ISOLATION ROOM

   [Fraiser walks in to find Cassandra watching the knight turning in mid
   air in front of her face.]

     FRAISER
     Cassandra? What are you doing?

     CASSANDRA
     It helps...to do this.

     FRAISER
     How?

     CASSANDRA
     It's almost like...the heat is leaving my body, and going into the
     chess piece. You haven't got a cure, have you?

     FRAISER
     No. We're still trying...

     CASSANDRA
     It's all right!

     FRAISER
     No, it's not. We may still learn something from the bio samples that
     SG-1 brought back. There might be something there that'll help your
     body produce some antibodies.

     CASSANDRA
     I want this to happen, Janet.

     FRAISER

     (whispers)
     Don't say that.

     CASSANDRA
     It's going to happen anyway.

     FRAISER
     You're ill.

     CASSANDRA
     You know that it's more than that now. I can feel a power inside me.

   [The knight is seen turning in midair.]

     CASSANDRA
     It's only the beginning.

     FRAISER
     And along with it, your body is undergoing an enormous physical
     strain.

     CASSANDRA
     You think it's gonna kill me?

     FRAISER
     I'm...worried about that possibility, yes.

     CASSANDRA

     (raises her voice)
     I don't care!

     FRAISER

     Well, you should!
     (voice beginning to shake)
     I know the limitations of the human body...

     CASSANDRA
     Maybe I'm not human anymore.

     FRAISER

     (quietly)
     Of course you are.

     CASSANDRA
     Maybe dying is part of the transformation.

     FRAISER

     (pointed, raised voice)
     I don't care whether it is or not!

   [The knight falls as Cassandra loses her concentration to look at her
   mom. Fraiser reaches over to pick the knight up. It burns her hand, and
   she quickly withdraws her hand with a gasp. She looks at her hand, then
   back to the knight.]

     CASSANDRA

     (softly)
     I'm sorry.

     FRAISER

     (sighs and composes herself)
     Sweetheart, sometimes, when a person is sick, it's important for
     them to fight. I want you to fight this, OK?

   [Fraiser gently strokes Cassandra's hair. Cassandra looks at Fraiser,
   then goes back to turning the knight, ignoring her mom. Fraiser looks
   at Cassandra, the knight, then turns and walks away, cradling her burnt
   hand.]

   INT--SGC, CARTER'S LAB

   [Fraiser and Carter are seated looking at a monitor showing Cassandra's
   latest scan.]

     CARTER
     That can't be right. The EM field must be interfering.

     FRAISER
     No, she'll be able to control that now. I ran the test three times,
     the result are consistent and it corresponds with the EEG. There's a
     25% higher level of activity than normal.

     CARTER
     How can her body sustain that?

     FRAISER
     Well, she's found a way to channel the heat from her body. Don't ask
     me how, but I don't know how long she'll be able to keep it up. What
     I'd like her to do is sleep. She's been awake for 30 hours straight.

     CARTER
     I was about to go and see her.

     FRAISER
     Thank you.

   [Carter touches her shoulder and leaves. Fraiser sighs and leaves as
   well. The camera zooms in on the computer. An invisible hand is seen
   typing. Nirrti's POV is shown looking at the EEG of Cassandra.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, SUNRISE

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY/ISOLATION ROOM

   [The doors open to show Carter walking in to see Cassandra.]

     CARTER
     Hey.

   [Cassandra is seen with a knight spinning in front of her. As she hears
   Carter, her concentration slips and the knight falls.]

     CARTER
     I hear you don't wanna sleep. You want some company?

     CASSANDRA
     You wouldn't leave.

   [Carter looks confused; softer.]

     CASSANDRA

     When the Goa'uld planted the bomb inside me...you wouldn't leave.
     (Carter nods, and lowers her head)
     Even though your orders were to leave me there alone. You stayed
     with me.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     CASSANDRA
     Why?

     CARTER
     I don't know...just an instinct.

     CASSANDRA
     That I was gonna be OK?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I think so.

     CASSANDRA
     But you didn't know for sure.

     CARTER
     No.

     CASSANDRA
     Well, ... that's how I feel about what's happening to me now. Do you
     understand?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I think I do. You want me to stay with you for a while?

     CASSANDRA

     (looking away)
     No, it's not time yet.

     CARTER
     Don't say that.

     CASSANDRA
     Well, when it is...time...will you be here?

     CARTER

     (softly)
     I promise.

     CASSANDRA
     I think I can sleep now...for a little while.

     CARTER
     OK.

   [Cassandra closes her eyes. Carter stands up, and kisses Cassandra's
   forehead.]

   INT--SGC, FRAISER'S LAB

   [Fraiser looks through a microscope at some samples, presumably from
   Cassandra. She writes something on the chart, and rubs her head like
   she has a headache. She puts her pen down on top of the chart on the
   RIGHT side of the microscope, gets up, and walks out, rubbing her
   shoulders.]

   [The door to the lab swings open, and the camera pans back to the
   microscope. The chair is moved away from the desk. A figure with a
   covered face and head appears, picks up the chart, and looks through
   it. She starts to study the sample left on the microscope.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Fraiser walks toward the elevator, and reaches into her pocket for her
   access pass. Realizing she has left it behind, she returns to her lab.]

   INT--SGC FRAISER'S LAB

   [The figure is still studying the sample. She looks up, and starts to
   read the chart left by Fraiser. On hearing Fraiser's footsteps, the
   figure puts down the chart, on the other side to where Fraiser left it,
   and presses something on her abdomen. She disappears seconds before
   Fraiser enters the room. Fraiser picks up the chart, and looks around.
   Seeing no-one she picks up her access card, and glances at the X-rays
   mounted on the wall in front of her. Something catches her eye, and she
   rushes out of the lab.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter is walking down the corridor, Fraiser runs to catch up to her.]

     FRAISER
     Sam?

     CARTER
     She's asleep.

     FRAISER
     Good. Listen the, the bodies of the villagers, what happened to
     them?

     CARTER
     They were cremated on 987; we sent a team back.

     FRAISER

     Good. So there might still be a bone fragment.
     (sounding desperate, talking very fast and frantically)
     If we can find one from someone who's been through the initiation,
     there still may be antibodies...

     CARTER

     (interrupting)
     Janet! That was 4 years ago. The chances of us even fi-

   [She is interrupted by alarms going off. The two of them rush round the
   corner to find an airman on the floor, unconscious, with another
   tending him.]

   [They are in front of the isolation room where Cassandra is. Fraiser
   briefly stops to make sure he's all right.]

     CARTER

     (looking at the airman)
     Oh, my God!

     FRAISER

     (running into the isolation room)
     Cassandra!?

     CASSANDRA

     (sitting up)
     It was a Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     What?

     CASSANDRA
     I was asleep. I thought it was a nurse coming in to take my
     blood...but I did...sense its presence.

     CARTER
     I didn't sense anything.

     CASSANDRA
     It was after you left. At first there was no one there, but then ,
     when it got closer, I saw someone.

   [She is visibly shaken. Carter runs out of the room.]

     CARTER

     (into intercom)
     This is a Code 3 alert! We need Zats and TER's in Isolation room 4
     now!

     FRAISER

     (to Cassandra)
     Are you all right?

     CASSANDRA
     It ran away when I screamed.

     HAMMOND

     (walking in followed by the rest of SG-1)
     Major?

     CARTER
     Apparently, there's a Goa'uld on base, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     What?!

     HAMMOND
     How's that possible?

     TEAL'C
     Nirrti possesses the technology to become invisible.

     DANIEL

     Cronos is dead.
     (Hammond looks at him)
     He's the system lord that was holding her prisoner.

     O'NEILL
     So she's out!

     DANIEL
     The rings in the lab, that wasn't me, it was her! She came back
     through the Stargate with us!

     CARTER
     Well, that would mean she was waiting for us in her lab the whole
     time.

     TEAL'C
     We may have inadvertently triggered a device alerting her to our
     presence.

   [Airmen come in with the equipment requested by Carter.]

     HAMMOND
     Go level by level, check everything...keep in radio contact. If you
     locate her, do not shoot to kill. Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     Staying here, Sir.

   [Everyone else but Fraiser and O'Neill leaves.]

     O'NEILL

     I figured, you fought her off the first time. I'm safer here with
     you.
     (He grins at her)

     CASSANDRA
     She was here the whole time you've been back.

     O'NEILL
     We'll find her.

     FRAISER
     She's right. Why did she wait until now to come after Cassandra?

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

     CARTER

     (after an Airman checks a small closet )
     Level 22 is clear.

   [Daniel swipes his access card to close off door G-2 Level 22. Teal'c
   is shown checking another corridor with an airman. He swipes his card
   to close the door.]

     TEAL'C

     (heard over radio by O'Neill)
     Level 21 clear.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Roger that.

     CASSANDRA
     She wanted to know if her experiment worked.

     FRAISER
     We don't know what she wants.

     CASSANDRA
     No. If, if the transformation were to kill me, she would have just
     let it happen. Don't you see?

     FRAISER
     Honey, not now.

     CASSANDRA
     No! But it did work!

     FRAISER

     (sternly)
     Cassandra!

     CASSANDRA

     (looks away, suddenly sensing something; quietly)
     No...
     (pointing to the airman in the room; shouts)
     Look out!

   [O'Neill points his zat at the observation window, as the glass is
   shattered by the pulse from a hand device. He is propelled backwards.
   The window breaks. Fraiser simultaneously covers Cassandra's head with
   her body. The airman points his TER at the window, and Nirrti is caught
   in its beam. She is somersaulting through the air. O'Neill zats her.
   She falls to the ground, the zat having disabled both her and her
   invisibility device. Fraiser gets off of Cassandra as the AIRMAN moves
   over Nirrti, pointing the TER at her.]

     O'NEILL
     Easy! We need her alive.

   [He takes off the mask and sees that it is Nirrti.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Security to Iso room 4. All search teams, stand down.

   [A rattling sound is heard from behind Fraiser. Cassandra has started
   seizing.]

     FRAISER

     Cassie?
     (panicked)
     Cassie! Don't do this! We need to get her out of here.
     (wheeling her out)
     Come on! Let's move! Roll her over...
     (a still seizing Cassandra is rolled on her side)
     Easy.

   [O'Neill looks on, very worried.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR/HOLDING ROOM

   [A card is swiped through an entry lock, and a door is opened to reveal
   Nirrti, sitting on a chair. Her wrists are in restraints. Hammond and
   O'Neill have entered the room. There is an exchange of venomous looks
   between the three.]

     O'NEILL
     What's gonna happen to Cassandra?

     NIRRTI
     What is her condition?

     O'NEILL
     She's just lost consciousness.

     NIRRTI
     Then the end is very near.

     O'NEILL
     If she dies...so do you.

     NIRRTI
     And what do you offer in return?

     HAMMOND
     I don't think you're in any position to bargain.

     NIRRTI

     I am in the position to save the life of a child that you hold dear.
     (more demanding)
     Release me.

     HAMMOND
     We can't do that.

     O'NEILL

     (whispers)
     General?

     NIRRTI
     With my invisibility device intact.

   [Hammond and O'Neill share a look.]

     NIRRTI
     I also require a sample of her blood.

     HAMMOND
     Absolutely not!

     NIRRTI
     Those are my terms.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR LEADING TO INFIRMARY

   [Daniel and Fraiser walk down the hall.]

     DANIEL
     She says she can help Cassandra.

     FRAISER
     If we trust her.

     DANIEL
     No, if we let her go.

     FRAISER
     Do you believe she can actually help?

     DANIEL
     Well, seeing as we don't have a choice...I guess it's worth a shot.

     FRAISER
     What about General Hammond? What's he gonna do?

     DANIEL
     He hasn't decided yet.

     FRAISER

     (stops walking and touches Daniel)
     I really need to get back to see Cassandra.

   [Fraiser begins to walk away, Daniel holds her hand.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I know how tough this has been for you, so if you need
     ...anything...

     FRAISER

     (obviously touched)
     Thanks.

   [Daniel watches her as she walks away.]

   INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM

   [Camera begins with close up of a monitor showing various readings from
   Cassandra. Pans round to show Fraiser reading her chart. Cassandra is
   unconscious on the bed. Fraiser holds her forehead, from obvious
   exhaustion and stress.]

     FRAISER
     Okay, give me 70 mg of dantrolene.

     NURSE
     Doctor?

     FRAISER

     (snaps)
     Now.

   [Cassandra rouses.]

     CASSANDRA
     Mom?

     FRAISER
     I'm here. We're just giving you something else to try and get your
     fever down.

     CASSANDRA
     It's happening.

     FRAISER
     Hey, I want you to do what we talked about, OK? I want you to fight
     this.

     CASSANDRA
     I don't want to fight it.

     FRAISER
     You have to! Honey, your body is not going to be able to survive
     what this retro virus is trying to do.

     CASSANDRA
     Where's Sam?

     FRAISER
     She's gone to see if she can get you some help.

     CASSANDRA
     Noooo! Let it happen! Let it ha--appen!

   [She is in obvious pain. The monitor alarms go off. Cassandra starts to
   seize again.]

     FRAISER
     Drop 10 of Valium.

   [Fraiser puts an oxygen mask over Cassie's face.]

     NURSE
     Valium's in.

   [The seizing subsides.]

     NURSE
     Temperature is 106!

     FRAISER
     The dantrolene's not working?!

   [Fraiser stays by Cassandra for a few second, then moves over to a
   nearby table and removes what looks like an EpiPen.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond, Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are seated at the table. O'Neill is
   slowly pacing the floor. They seem to be in mid-conversation.]

     O'NEILL
     General, with all due respect, It's not like we're negotiating with
     terrorists.

     HAMMOND
     It's exactly that, Colonel. You're letting your emotions get in the
     way.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I am. Shouldn't you be?

     HAMMOND

     (a second's hesitation)
     Jack...

     CARTER
     Sir, up until yesterday, we didn't even know Nirrti was still alive.

     O'NEILL
     Exactly.

   [He sits down next to Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Now who cares if we let her go. What difference does it make in the
     grand scheme of things if there's one more Goa'uld running around?

     HAMMOND
     If we were to allow Nirrti to leave with a sample of Cassandra's
     blood, She could well succeed in her experiment to create a
     genetically advanced host, and become dangerously powerful!

     TEAL'C
     I am in agreement with GeneralHammond.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     TEAL'C
     The life of a child may be sacrificed, but Nirrti possesses valuable
     information that would be lost if we allowed her to leave.

   [O'Neill shakes his head in disbelief.]

   INT--OUTSIDE SGC HOLDING CELL

     FRAISER

     (to the airman at Nirrti's door)
     General Hammond would like me to check in on her.

   [The airman swipes the door, and Fraiser sticks him in the neck with
   the needle we saw her take earlier on. He falls down, she storms in the
   room, cocks a gun, and points it at Nirrti.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER
     Teal'c, we're talking about Cassandra.

     TEAL'C
     Of that I am aware. But her sacrifice would benefit both of our
     peoples. Nirrti possesses valuable information that would help us
     defeat the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     We'll find another way.

     HAMMOND
     We may never have a Goa'uld as our prisoner again.

     CARTER
     Sir, I don't have to remind you of what Cassandra has gone through
     because of the Goa'uld. Now, if we're gonna put what we MAY learn or
     what MIGHT happen over her life...

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     It's time to "Pack it in".

     DANIEL
     I agree.

   [Hammond looks at each of his people, mulling over what he has heard.]

     INTERCOM
     General Hammond to the Holding Room.

   INT--SGC HOLDING ROOM

   [The camera follows O'Neill as he walks in the room. Nirrti is standing
   up, facing Fraiser, who is still pointing a gun at her. An airman in
   the corner of the room is pointing his weapon at Fraiser. The rest of
   SG-1 and Hammond arrive.]

     HAMMOND

     (softly)
     Doctor Fraiser, stand down.

     FRAISER

     (voice shaking)
     I can't do that, Sir. I don't have a choice.

     CARTER

     (standing next to Fraiser)
     Janet. Don't do this.

     FRAISER
     I can't...help Cassandra. She can.

     HAMMOND
     Doctor Fraiser, SG-1 has already convinced me to make a deal for
     Cassandra's life. This isn't necessary.

     NIRRTI
     Then you agree to my terms?

     HAMMOND
     Just one...once you've cured Cassandra of her illness, you'll be
     free to go.

     NIRRTI
     And how do I know you will honor this?

     HAMMOND
     You have only my word.

     NIRRTI
     Not enough.

     HAMMOND

     (looks at Fraiser who has the gun still pointed at the Goa'uld)
     Then I shall remind you that the woman holding the gun on you is
     Cassandra's mother.

   INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM

   [Cassandra is crashing. Fraiser is standing by her bedside. Nirrti
   comes in and shares a look with Fraiser, who moves away. A table is
   pushed next to Nirrti containing the instruments found at the alien lab
   by SG-1. Carter and O'Neill are in the room with Fraiser, while
   Hammond, Daniel and Teal'c look on from the observation deck above.
   Nirrti uses the instruments to gauge Cassandra's condition. They light
   up, briefly. The monitor continues to show "critical"]

     NIRRTI
     You have waited too long.

     FRAISER

     (angrily)
     You try again.

   [Nirrti looks at her, then at O'Neill. Nirrti tries again, watched by
   the members of SG-1. After a minute or so, Cassandra starts coughing.]

     NIRRTI
     It is done.

     CARTER
     Vital signs are all returning to normal.

   [Cassandra gasps for breath, and takes off her mask.]

     CASSANDRA

     (she looks at Nirrti, and is obviously frightened)
     Mom?

     FRAISER

     It's OK.
     (voice shaking)
     I'm here.

     NIRRTI

     (to O'Neill)
     I have honored my part.

   [O'Neill looks from Nirrti to Hammond, who nods.]

     O'NEILL
     Let's go to the Gate.

   [O'Neill walks out, followed by Nirrti. He briefly looks back to see
   Fraiser and Cassandra hugging.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     O'NEILL
     We've never dialled these coordinates before...I...sort of hope you
     know what you're doing.

     NIRRTI
     It is not my final destination. Without a sample of her blood, I
     will have to begin my experiment again.

     O'NEILL
     Aw nuts.

     NIRRTI
     At least you have honoured this much of our bargain. In your place,
     I doubt I would have done the same.

     O'NEILL
     I'll keep that thought alive.

   [A wormhole is established. Both O'Neill and Nirrti watch the kawhoosh.
   They exchange hostile glances. Nirrti smirks, then leaves. Hammond
   sighs as he watches from the control room. O'Neill watches the Gate
   long after Nirrti has left.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Cassandra looks much better. She is sitting up in bed, wearing a white
   t-shirt and blue jacket. Textbooks are open in front of her, and she is
   reading one of them. The camera pans round to see Fraiser completing a
   chart. She glances up to check on Cassandra. The camera continues to
   pan, to reveal Carter walking in with a chess set.]

     CARTER
     Hey, Janet! How's our patient?

     CASSANDRA
     Bored.

   [Carter makes herself comfortable on the end of Cassandra's bed.]

     FRAISER
     The uh...homework's backed up. Other than that she's just fine. I
     get to take her home tonight.

     CARTER
     Uuhh...Dominic awaits.

     CASSANDRA

     (unimpressed)
     Stop it.

     CARTER

     (teasing)
     Uh come on, that last kiss was impressive.

   [Fraiser smiles.]

     CASSANDRA
     Stop it!

     CARTER

     (obviously enjoying herself)
     Lights exploded overhead!

     CASSANDRA

     (blushing, and smiling)
     Stop it!

   [Carter laughs.]

     CASSANDRA
     Aarrggh!

   [She laughs.]

     CARTER
     It's Saturday.

     CASSANDRA
     OK. But...I won't be able to move the pieces around just by thinking
     about it...sorry.

   [She grins.]

     CARTER
     Good. Then we're even.

   [Carter smiles.]

   [Fraiser watches as they set up the game. She smiles.]
