   PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1

   EXCERPT FROM 10.10 "THE QUEST PART 1

   [Osric, SG-1, and Ba'al walk through a field towards a large mountain
   in the distance.]

   EXCERPT FROM 9.18 "ARTHUR'S MANTLE"

   [Daniel translates Merlin's log from the transdimensional device.]

     DANIEL
     Merlin was conducting research on some kind of new invention...A
     weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.

   EXCERPTS FROM 10.11 "THE QUEST PART 2"

   INT--MERLIN'S LAB

   [An old man with long white hair and beard sleeps within an Ancient
   stasis pod. Daniel translates the Ancient plaque near the pod.]

     DANIEL
     Here lies Myrddin, Archmage of the Round.

   LATER

   [Merlin is thrust backward and falls to the floor before Daniel or Vala
   can stop him. They kneel beside Merlin. His eyes are fixed open; he
   takes one last breath, then stops. Daniel puts his fingers on Merlin's
   neck, beneath his beard.]

     DANIEL
     He's dead.

   LATER

   [Daniel and Vala stand in front of the Repository device.]

     DANIEL
     We've seen it used to download information into someone's mind.

   LATER

   [Daniel uses the device.]

   LATER

   [Mitchell and Vala talk to Daniel.]

     VALA
     You have Merlin's memories?

     DANIEL
     Some of them. Earth, Atlantis, and the work he did in this lab.

   LATER

   [Daniel interfaces with the Ancient repository device. Several large
   pieces join to form a disk-shaped object. It settles to the top of the
   platform and materializes. The machine shuts off. Mitchell and Vala
   approach.]

     MITCHELL
     What is that?

     DANIEL
     The first step towards creating Merlin's weapon.

   LATER

   [Daniel sits, wincing in pain. Vala crouches in front of him.]

     DANIEL

     (breathing heavily)
     I just have too many thoughts in my head. I--I can't concentrate. I
     get confused.

     VALA
     You have to fight it.

     DANIEL

     (putting his fingers to his temples)
     I have to let it happen.

   EXT--STARGATE AREA OUTSIDE MERLIN'S CAVE, DAY

   [SG-1 are in a firefight with Ori soldiers coming through the
   Stargate.]

   [Daniel is thrown out of Merlin's cave onto the ground. Adria exits.
   She raises her hand and red energy tendrils form and launch towards
   SG-1. Daniel jumps in front and blocks the blast with a white energy
   blast of his own. The two are at a stalemate, but Daniel struggles.]

     DANIEL

     (straining with effort)
     Get through the Gate!...I'll be right behind you.

   [Mitchell grabs Vala and takes her to the gate and into the wormhole.
   Carter and Teal'c reluctantly follow.]

   [Daniel collapses, barely conscious. Adria stands over him, smiling.]

   TEASER

   EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE OFFWORLD, DAY

   [SG-1, still missing Daniel, walk through the village, talking with the
   leader, Tevaris. Tevaris carries a copy of the "Book of Origin" with
   him.]

     TEVARIS
     He was very persuasive.

     MITCHELL
     Convert or die. Yeah I'd say that's got some bite.

     TEVARIS
     He said nothing of death, only salvation and life eternal. The
     blessings of the Ori.

     VALA

     (suspicious)
     He didn't threaten you?

     TEVARIS
     He spoke of...the religion. Left this book with us to read and
     consider. Said he'd be back today to hear our answer.

   [Tevaris indicates the "Book of Origin" in his hand.]

     CARTER
     Well, you're not alone. This is happening all over the galaxy.

     TEVARIS
     Are you saying this Prior's claims are false?

     MITCHELL
     We're saying that book's got about as much truth in it as The
     DaVinci Code.

     VALA

     (conspiratorially)
     Hey, that's what they want you to think.

     MITCHELL
     "They?" They who?

     TEVARIS
     I do not understand.

     MITCHELL
     It's a book, from our planet. It's very entertaining, but it is
     fiction nonetheless.

     VALA

     (chuckling to Tevaris)
     I wouldn't be so sure.

   [Carter steps in front of the group.]

     CARTER
     Okay, I think we've gotten a little off point, here.

     TEVARIS
     What evidence do you have to support your position?

     CARTER

     (off-guard)
     Well, we really don't...have any. And we can't tell you what to do.
     Obviously, subjugating people by threatening their lives is wrong.
     So if you choose to resist, we'll do our very best to try to help
     you.

     MITCHELL
     Not that we can make many promises, but we've seen a number of
     villages just like this one wiped out.

     VILLAGER

     (in background)
     Load the wagon and take it to the river.

     TEVARIS
     As I have said, the Prior made no such threat... and spoke upon the
     positive merits of Origin as true salvation.

     MITCHELL

     (low, to Carter)
     Soft-sell, that's a new approach.

     CARTER

     (to Mitchell)
     Mm-hmm.

     VILLAGER

     (calling from a distance)
     The Prior of Ori returns!

     MITCHELL
     Listen, no matter which way you're gonna come down on this, it's
     probably best if that Prior doesn't know we're around.

     TEVIAS

     (nodding)
     You can hide here.

   [Tevaris leads the team to a tent. They remain in the shadows there,
   watching through the opening as the Prior approaches. Villagers gather
   around as Tevaris greets the Prior.]

     TEVARIS
     Welcome back.

     PRIOR
     Thank you, Tevaris. Have you contemplated your divine right?

     TEVARIS
     We have, Prior. We wish to hear more of your wisdom.

     PRIOR
     It is not my wisdom, but the wisdom of the ages passed on to us by
     the only true gods...

   [The Prior lowers his hood. It is Daniel Jackson. His face is pale and
   tattooed, his eyes milk colored, and his hair greyed, as is common with
   the Priors.]

     DANIEL
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   [SG-1 watch, stunned.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, Vala, Mitchell, and Teal'c brief Landry.]

     VALA
     Adria must have done something to him. I mean, before turning him
     into a Prior.

     LANDRY
     You mean, she brainwashed him somehow?

     CARTER
     Well, Daniel would never willingly become one of them like that.
     Preach their beliefs.

     MITCHELL
     He's damn good at it. Had those people eating out of his hands
     without issuing one tiny little genocidal threat.

     VALA
     That's what makes me think there's still a part of Daniel in there
     somewhere. H-he's better than all this!

     CARTER
     Yes! But we still have to face the very real possibility that it's
     not even really Daniel anymore. Having Merlin's consciousness
     downloaded into his mind could've overshadowed Daniel
     completely--weakened him to the point where Adria could do this.

     TEAL'C
     Still, we cannot abandon him.

     LANDRY
     So what do we do?

     MITCHELL
     We go get him. Try to figure out what happened; try to undo it. Turn
     him back.

     LANDRY
     That's going to be very risky.

     VALA
     Could be exactly what Adria's hoping for. She might be using him to
     get to us.

     CARTER
     Still, it's Daniel. If there's any chance...

     TEAL'C
     We have no choice.

   [Landry nods.]

   EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, SUNSET

   [The Prior Daniel Jackson stands on a couple of wooden boxes, reading
   from the "Book of Origin" to the gathering crowd.]

     DANIEL

     "Aroden then took off the mask and revealed his face. 'Your
     appearance matters not,' he said. 'Only the truth of spirit in your
     heart.'"
     (he closes the book)
     Blessed are those that follow the path to Origin.

   [Daniel is beamed away, causing cries of consternation amongst the
   villagers.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Daniel is beamed into a room that has a chair, similar, if not
   identical, to the one the SGC used to secure Khalek. Mitchell and
   Teal'c are waiting for him, both with zats readied. Behind them, on a
   table, is an anti-Prior device. Daniel blinks but seems unconcerned at
   this circumstance.]

     DANIEL

     (annoyed)
     Hey! What took you guys so long?

   [Teal'c and Mitchell exchange sidelong looks. Teal'c lowers his zat as
   Mitchell fires. Daniel crumples to the floor with a grunt,
   unconscious.]

     MITCHELL

     (into wireless headset)
     Carter, we've got him.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Carter sits in the commander's chair; crew man their stations around
   her.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Great!
     (to helmsman)
     Take us into hyperspace.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey leaves orbit of the planet and jumps into hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Carter joins her teammates. Heavily armed guards are posted nearby.
   Daniel has been secured to the chair, still unconscious. Each arm is
   strapped down on the armrest by large metal bands and his legs are
   pinned to the footrest by a metal bar. His Prior robes have been
   removed, and he is now dressed in blue prisoner jumpsuit.]

     CARTER

     (nervously)
     I take it the anti-Prior device is working?

     MITCHELL
     Well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.

   [Daniel stirs.]

     DANIEL
     Guys?

   [Carter approaches, studying him.]

     CARTER
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

     VALA
     We could be asking you.

   [Daniel realizes he is restrained. He taps his fingers impatiently
   against the armrest and rocks against the chair.]

     DANIEL
     Okay...this is not necessary.

     MITCHELL
     No offense, but have you looked in the mirror lately?

     DANIEL

     (irked)
     I'm not a threat to you.

     MITCHELL
     In case you change your mind, you should know there is someone with
     a finger poised over a button waiting to beam you out into space.

   [Daniel leans back in the chair and closes his eyes.]

     DANIEL
     We had to let this happen. It's part of the plan.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, "we"?

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah. Myself and...Merlin.

     VALA

     (skeptically)
     Oh, so he's still inside you?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you remember back on the planet when Adria and I were fighting
     it out?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah. Thanks for that by the way.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it's a good thing you guys got out too. Uh, she was...way too
     powerful for me. But I couldn't just let Merlin's weapon fall into
     her hands. I know it's our only chance of destroying the Ori.

     VALA
     You gave in.

     DANIEL
     More or less.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--SPACE

   [An Ori warship flies at subspace speeds.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Adria and Daniel walk through the corridor of the warship. Adria is in
   a gold brocade strapless gown. Daniel is dressed in the blue uniform of
   an Ori crew member. Other crew members pause and bow as the Orici,
   Adria, goes by.]

     ADRIA
     Of course, Origin is designed to channel the energy of its followers
     to the Ori. It's that unselfish act of giving that leads one's soul
     to salvation and ultimately to ascension. This is no great secret.
     The "Book of Origin" says: "Make yourself one with the path, and the
     journey will lead you to eternity." Were it not for the power the
     Ori draw from our belief, the Ancients would've wiped them out long
     ago.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     ADRIA
     You know the answer. You were once ascended.

     DANIEL

     (caustically)
     Because they won't tolerate anyone or anything that doesn't follow
     their collective rules.

     ADRIA
     They claim not to interfere, but they do manipulate. They use their
     power to hoard their knowledge and prevent those beneath them from
     reaching their level.

     DANIEL

     (voiceover)
     She seemed to know everything about me, and she had a...a tremendous
     power of persuasion. It was almost as if I could hear her voice
     inside my head telling me what to believe.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

     DANIEL
     So, I let her believe that she was getting to me, turning me.

     MITCHELL
     Why?

     DANIEL
     Because I needed her to trust me.

     VALA

     (bitingly)
     And did she? Well, I mean, don't get me wrong, you're not a terrible
     liar, but you're nowhere near as good as me.

     MITCHELL
     Who is?

     VALA

     (shrugging in agreement to Mitchell)
     Huh.
     (accusingly, to Daniel)
     And Adria could see right through me, so how did you manage to fool
     her?

     DANIEL

     (speaking more formally)
     I was able to protect Daniel; make Adria think he had succumbed to
     her will.

     CARTER
     Merlin?

     DANIEL

     (nodding in acknowledgment)
     It was necessary.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--ADRIA'S CHAMBER, ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel kneels on the floor, surrounded by several cushions. Each hand
   rests over one of his knees, and his demeanor is relaxed. Adria kneels
   across from him. Both appear to be meditating. Adria opens her eyes and
   studies Daniel.]

     ADRIA
     In our time together, I've really come to see in you what draws
     Mother's affection.

     DANIEL

     (startled)
     Affectio-what?

   [Adria moves closer to Daniel, still on her knees until she is directly
   in front of him.]

     ADRIA
     It's very important to me that we save her together.

     DANIEL
     Oh, of course.

     ADRIA

     (smiling)
     I can feel the difference in you.

   [Daniel blinks.]

     DANIEL

     (sincerely)
     It's because you've done so much for me, showing me the true path.

     ADRIA
     I'm glad. And there's so much more I can do for you. And you for me.

   [Daniel stares at Adria curiously. She leans forward, and they kiss.
   Afterwards, she clasps both his forearms, which are still resting on
   his knees. The pendant around her neck begins to glow, surrounding
   Daniel. When it dissipates, Daniel has been converted into a Prior. She
   caresses his cheek.]

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

     VALA

     (unconvinced)
     So, she trusted you enough to turn you into a Prior?

     DANIEL
     She had to.

     MITCHELL
     Why, exactly?

     DANIEL

     (forcefully)
     Because she knew I was her best chance at converting Earth.

     VALA

     (low, to Mitchell)
     And me.

   [Daniel's team exchange concerned looks.]

     CARTER
     Well, that would explain why she wanted to believe you, not why she
     had to.

     DANIEL
     She had Merlin's weapon, she just didn't know how to finish it.

     MITCHELL
     I thought she knew everything.

     VALA

     (softly)
     She's human. Her knowledge is still limited.

     CARTER
     But Merlin knew how.

     DANIEL
     It was a quick and easy way to avoid an all-out war between the Ori
     and the Ancients. She knows the device can be used to wipe out the
     Ancients, so I told her I would finish it for her.

     MITCHELL
     Did you?

     DANIEL
     Not exactly, but close. I needed to have the rest of my plan in
     place before I finished it.

   [The others exchange skeptical looks.]

     MITCHELL
     Which is?

     DANIEL
     I needed her to make me a Prior.

     VALA
     Hello!

     DANIEL

     (continuing quickly)
     So I could steal an Ori ship and fly it through the Supergate to the
     Ori galaxy with the weapon on board and destroy them.

     CARTER
     Okay, um, one small flaw in that plan.

     DANIEL
     I know, there's a wormhole blocking the Supergate, and that's why
     I'm here. I need you guys to shut it down.

   [Daniel looks at his teammates hopefully as they exchange shocked
   expressions.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1, minus Daniel, briefs both Landry and O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     He knew he was no match for her, and he couldn't let Merlin's
     unfinished weapon fall into her hands. So, he and Merlin came up
     with a plan to fool Adria into thinking that he had succumbed to her
     power.

     MITCHELL
     So he could continue to work on the weapon. Ostensibly, this time
     for her to use against the Ancients.

     O'NEILL

     (puzzled)
     Merlin?

     VALA
     He says he still has Merlin's consciousness in his mind.

     CARTER
     Merlin even seemed to be speaking on occasion. Daniel says that's
     what's protected him from Adria's influence and what's allowed him
     to convince her to make him a Prior.

     O'NEILL

     (warily)
     Why did he need her to make him a Prior?

     VALA
     So he could steal the Ori ship with the weapon on board and fly it
     through the Supergate.

     CARTER
     He wants us to shut down the incoming wormhole, so he can dial out.

     O'NEILL

     (skeptically)
     Yeah. So he says.

     TEAL'C
     You do not believe Daniel Jackson is being truthful.

     O'NEILL

     (shrugging)
     Oh, I want to believe him.

     MITCHELL
     That could be exactly what they expect of us.

     CARTER
     If Adria really did somehow manage to brainwash Daniel, then...

     LANDRY

     (interrupting)
     This whole thing could be an elaborate plot to get us to shut down
     that wormhole so more Ori ships can come into our galaxy.

   [SG-1 nod in agreement.]

     VALA

     (leaning forward)
     So what do we do?

   [O'Neill and the others exchange looks.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey floats in Earth orbit.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [O'Neill enters. The anti-Prior device is still active, and two heavily
   armed SFs guard Daniel.]

     O'NEILL

     (to guards)
     Fellas...?

   [He gestures for them to leave. They take positions outside the door,
   which closes behind them. O'Neill approaches Daniel cautiously,
   studying him. After a pause...]

     O'NEILL
     This is new.

     DANIEL

     (pleasantly)
     Yeah, it's always something, isn't it?

     O'NEILL

     (grimacing)
     Gotta tell ya, though. Not your look.

     DANIEL
     Oh, it is just temporary.

     O'NEILL
     Really?

     DANIEL
     Yeah! Yeah, see when, um, Merlin programmed the Ancient device to
     download his consciousness into my brain, he gave it a time limit.
     See, he knew I could only survive so long with the knowledge and
     consciousness of two distinct people in one mind, so...

   [While Daniel speaks, O'Neill grabs a stool from the other side of the
   room and wheels it back.]

     O'NEILL
     And when he goes?

     DANIEL
     He's genetically programmed my body and mind to revert back to the
     state it was in before he was downloaded.

     O'NEILL

     (sitting)
     He can do that?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I'm hoping so. I won't look like this anymore. I won't have
     any of the Prior's special abilities. Unfortunately, I'll just be
     li'l ol' me again.

     O'NEILL
     But that's good news.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, except I won't be able to fly an Ori ship; it will be too late
     to execute the plan; and Adria will have Merlin's weapon.

     O'NEILL

     (suspiciously)
     I thought that wasn't finished yet.

     DANIEL
     It's very close. All the pieces are there. It just needs to be
     assembled. Adria will figure it out.

     O'NEILL
     And just when does your "chariot" turn back into a "pumpkin"?

     DANIEL

     (sighing)
     I don't have much time...A day or so.

     O'NEILL
     A day?! Kinda risky leaving it this late in the game.

     DANIEL
     Well, I didn't have much choice, and it took you guys a little
     longer to capture me than I planned, so...

     O'NEILL
     Right...Why did we have to do that again?

     DANIEL

     (reasonably)
     Well, I couldn't exactly just come to you. I think Adria might have
     suspected something.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I see.

     DANIEL
     Jack, you have to believe me!

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     DANIEL

     (incredulous)
     Why?! Well, because, oh I don't know, the fate of the galaxy hangs
     in the balance!?

     O'NEILL

     (shaking his head)
     You know, that old chestnut's gettin' a little...old.

     DANIEL

     (voice rising)
     No, no, that part never gets old. Now, you have to shut down that
     Supergate, and you have to let me go!

     O'NEILL

     (equably)
     You know how much I hate being told what to do.

     DANIEL
     Jack! It's ME!

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     What, that's supposed to convince me!? Look at you!

     DANIEL

     Have I ever let you down?
     (hurriedly before O'Neill retorts)
     No! Don't answer that. Have I ever let you down when it really
     mattered?

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     I don't even know who I'm really talking to right now!

     DANIEL
     Not when you were being tortured by Ba'al, killed, brought back to
     life, over and over again? I stood by you the whole time...

     O'NEILL
     All right, just stop! I don't need to be reminded of that! I've been
     around this barbecue a few times. Just because you know the stuff
     Daniel knows doesn't mean you're him, doesn't mean you're telling
     the truth. I mean, come on, you've got to know what you're asking me
     to do.

     DANIEL

     (earnest and forceful)
     I do!

     O'NEILL
     You know, there's a bottom line here. Carter doesn't think it can be
     done.

     DANIEL

     (shaking his head and talking over him)
     Yes it can. A Mark IX beamed directly behind the Gate in the Pegasus
     Galaxy will destroy that Gate. The wormhole connection will be
     broken!

     O'NEILL

     (incredulous)
     How do you know that?

     DANIEL

     (fidgeting in the chair and tossing his head)
     Hello?! Merlin!

     O'NEILL

     (rolling his eyes and drawling mockingly)
     Oh yes. "Merlin"!

     DANIEL

     (frustrated)
     Jack, I wish I had proof. I wish I had a way to convince you, but I
     don't. Now, this was the only choice I had, and I took it. It's a
     good plan. It-it just happens to hinge on you guys believing in me,
     having a little "faith". Now I thought you of all people might!

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     WHY?! You of all people should know that I don't believe anything
     anybody says, even if I understand what they're talking about!

     DANIEL

     (pleading)
     Jack, it's me!

     O'NEILL
     Yeah?

   [Daniel fidgets in his chair again, his eyebrows raised, his expression
   hopeful.]

     O'NEILL

     (waving dismissively)
     Oh.

   [He turns away and leaves. Daniel waves his restrained hands in
   frustration.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter and O'Neill study some paperwork together over her worktable.]

     CARTER
     He's right, sir. A Mark IX Gatebuster beamed directly behind the
     event horizon so the force won't be absorbed by the active wormhole
     would destroy the Gate and sever the connection.

     O'NEILL

     (sighing)
     Yeah, I should've known that.

     CARTER
     So, do-do you believe him now?

     O'NEILL
     I honestly don't know.

     CARTER
     Unfortunately, I don't think a polygraph would work in this case.

     O'NEILL

     (turning to her)
     No, but I'm not worried about that. See, I think we've got something
     better.

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Teal'c strides into the room heading directly to Daniel. He stands
   close to the chair, his body posture intimidating.]

     DANIEL
     You know, Teal'c, the longer I'm gone, the more suspicious Adria's
     going to become.

     TEAL'C
     Why were you preaching to the villagers on that planet?

     DANIEL

     (confused)
     What? I-I told you, I found out you guys were going to be there, so
     I set myself up to be captured.

     TEAL'C
     You misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson. Why is Adria not suspicious of
     your actions? You attempt to reform a meaningless planet of people
     instead of completing the weapon.

     DANIEL

     (grudgingly)
     Actually, she was the one who stopped me before I completed the
     weapon.

     TEAL'C
     Why?

   FLASHBACK

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [Merlin's Ancient interface computer is in the chamber. Daniel uses the
   machine, building the weapon. Large pieces of it fall into place. Adria
   enters. She lays a gentle hand on Daniel's back before approaching the
   weapon. Daniel notes her presence, then turns back to the interface.]

     DANIEL
     I'm almost done.

     ADRIA
     I know. You must stop for now.

   [Daniel complies, turning off the machine and approaching her,
   curious.]

     DANIEL
     You're afraid the Ancients will take the device away from us before
     we can use it.

     ADRIA
     They've interfered once before in its creation. You're using
     Merlin's knowledge, knowledge he kept from when he was ascended.

     DANIEL
     But if I don't finish it...

     ADRIA
     For now, you must help bring the energy of more followers into the
     fold.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Teal'c studies Daniel closely as he speaks.]

     DANIEL
     The original plan was for the Ori to convert our whole galaxy so
     that they could build up their power enough to attack the Ancients.
     But even then, a conflict like that on that level was going to be
     costly. But now they have a weapon that could destroy all Ascended
     Beings within the scope of an entire galaxy in one fell swoop. They
     just need to distract the Ancients long enough so that they can use
     it.

     TEAL'C
     Engage them in battle long enough to complete the weapon.

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Then back off to safety while Adria detonates it.

     TEAL'C
     If the Ancients perceive this weapon as a threat, why not intervene
     and simply take it now?

     DANIEL
     I have no idea. I mean, maybe they want to give my plan a chance to
     work. Either way, the Ori believe they still need more power to
     maximize their chances for success.

     TEAL'C
     More power. That means they will need more followers.

     DANIEL
     Exactly. Adria's out working hard for the cause, which leaves me the
     perfect opportunity to steal the ship with the weapon on it. If you
     guys would just believe I'm still on your side!

   [Daniel's voice rises, angry and frustrated, and he stares at Teal'c.
   Teal'c glowers back. Daniel takes a deep breath and meets Teal's gaze
   earnestly.]

     DANIEL

     (softly)
     We're running out of time.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c enters. Vala, Mitchell, Carter, and O'Neill sit around the
   table.]

     TEAL'C
     I believe Daniel Jackson speaks the truth.

     O'NEILL
     Lotta good it's gonna do us.

   [O'Neill points with his thumb towards Landry's office. Through the
   window, Teal'c observes Landry and Richard Woolsey. Landry moves
   towards the door heading to the briefing room. He enters.]

     LANDRY

     (furious)
     I'm gonna let you tell them yourself, because I don't have the
     stomach for it.

   [Woolsey follows him into the room.]

     MITCHELL
     Aw, that's all right, sir. Gen. O'Neill filled us in. The IOA has
     nixed the whole thing.

     LANDRY
     No, I don't think you know everything.

   [Everyone looks up, concerned, and stares at Woolsey. Woolsey
   cautiously approaches the table.]

     WOOLSEY
     I... You have to understand, we've considered all the evidence at
     our disposal. But more than that, as difficult as this is, I feel
     very strongly that we have no viable option.

   [Mitchell stands, hands on hips, and moves close to Woolsey.]

     MITCHELL
     You wanna get to the point?!

     WOOLSEY
     I assure you this may be the hardest decision I'll ever make. But I
     take full responsibility for it. Based on my recommendation, the IOA
     has proposed to the President that Daniel Jackson's life be
     terminated...immediately.

   [SG-1 and O'Neill look stricken.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey continues its orbit.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Daniel remains secured in his chair. Vala sits on his lap, her legs
   swinging over one side.]

     DANIEL

     (impatiently)
     So...what the hell is going on?

     VALA
     This and that. You know, the usual. You'll never believe what's
     happening on One Life to Live.

     DANIEL

     (nodding dismissively)
     You know, I really hate to press the issue here, but I do have a
     deadline.

   [Vala grimaces and looks away.]

     VALA

     (under her breath)
     Oh, so do we.

     DANIEL

     (mockingly)
     Oh yes, I know. Before I figure out how to overcome the effects of
     the anti-Prior device, oooh.
     (annoyed)
     I thought Teal'c believed me!

     VALA
     Oh, he does.

     DANIEL

     (cautiously)
     Jack?

     VALA
     No, he's on your side too.

   [Daniel looks at her more closely.]

     VALA
     That...little weasel man who somehow...represents your government?

   [Daniel thinks for a moment.]

     DANIEL
     Woolsey?

     VALA

     (reluctantly)
     I-I can't be certain, but...I think he might not like you.

   [Daniel's expression turns grave.]

     DANIEL
     He wants to have me killed, doesn't he?

     VALA

     (falsely bright)
     Well, I'm not sure how serious he is. He seems like quite the
     prankster to me.

     DANIEL
     No, I was afraid of that. He was the one who argued to keep Khalek
     alive and got burned for it.

     VALA
     Khalek?

     DANIEL
     Oh, Anubis's highly evolved half-breed son. Two people died as a
     result. It could've been...much worse.

     VALA

     (softly)
     Now that you mention it, that seems to be in play.
     (she pats him on the arm)
     But, not to worry. If it comes down to it, I have a plan.

   [Vala hops off of Daniel's lap. Daniel does not appear reassured.]

     DANIEL

     (sarcastically)
     Oh, you have a plan. Great. What is it?

   [Vala turns around, letting out a huff of breath. Daniel watches her
   shrewdly.]

     VALA

     (stammering)
     Well...when I said that I had a plan, I meant that I have...to
     plan...the plan. So when...or-or rather if it comes down to it, I
     will have a plan. I've, um, cleared my whole afternoon...for the
     planning.

     DANIEL

     (somber)
     You believe me, right?

   [Vala gulps, her eyes wide.]

     VALA

     (weakly)
     Mm-hmm.

     DANIEL
     Okay. Now I don't believe you.

   [Daniel and Vala stare at each other. She grabs one of the stools and
   rolls it over close to him, sitting on it. Her expression is now
   earnest, her voice soft and serious.]

     VALA
     Imagine our positions were reversed. What would you do?

   [Daniel tilts his head and looks at her pointedly.]

     DANIEL
     Hmm.

     VALA
     I know you've trusted me even when you've had every reason not to.
     But perhaps I'm the only one who knows how dangerous and powerful
     Adria is. There's no evidence, only your word. And that should be
     enough. But this is so big.

     DANIEL
     Well, I wouldn't let them kill you.

     VALA

     (chuckling without humor)
     Of course not. I won't let that happen to you. But would you support
     me if what I was proposing could very well open the door to the
     final Ori victory? Not if there was the slightest chance that I
     wasn't on the level. Even if it was the tiniest, nagging doubt.

   [Daniel remains silent and pensive as Vala stands and leaves the room.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Landry sits behind his desk. O'Neill and Woolsey sit next to each
   other in chairs across from him. They are in the middle of a heated
   discussion]

     O'NEILL
     That's a load of crap! You're wasting our time.

     WOOLSEY
     Dr. Jackson was the one who suggested we should kill Khalek.

     O'NEILL
     He was the demon spawn of Anubis!

     WOOLSEY
     And Dr. Jackson is now potentially an even greater threat!

     LANDRY
     I think the operative word there is "potentially." We don't know
     exactly what's going on yet.

     WOOLSEY
     And by the time we do, it may be too late! We know that anti-Prior
     device will only subdue his powers for a limited time. After that,
     you won't be able to control him!

     O'NEILL
     All right, listen to me closely, 'cause I'm only going to say this
     once. You kill Daniel...over my dead body!

     LANDRY
     Obviously, we need to discuss some realistic options.

     WOOLSEY
     We can't hold Dr. Jackson long-term, and we can't release him given
     what he knows.

     LANDRY
     Well, if he has fallen under their influence, the Ori likely know
     everything they can learn from him already.

     WOOLSEY
     What are you suggesting?

     LANDRY
     Dr. Jackson claims he'll revert back to his old self in short order.
     We only need to hold him long enough to see if that's true. If it's
     not, we still have the option of placing him in stasis.

     WOOLSEY
     If he hasn't already caused a major catastrophe by then.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, will you stop it! If he is telling the truth, then we've blown
     the best chance we've ever had of beating the bad guys!

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Teal'c, Mitchell, and Carter stand waiting in the lab. O'Neill
   enters.]

     CARTER
     How's it going, sir?

     O'NEILL

     (frustrated)
     Longing for the days when I actually carried a weapon! What do you
     got?

     CARTER
     A crazy idea.

     O'NEILL
     I'm down with crazy. I like crazy. Crazy and I are like "that".

   [He gestures, showing his first two fingers next to each other, then
   separate. Carter turns to Mitchell.]

     CARTER
     Cam likes crazy too.

     MITCHELL
     Listen, if what Jackson is saying is true, there is an Ori ship out
     there with a near-complete weapon on it that could prove useful
     against the Ori. I think we should go after it.

     O'NEILL
     You're right. That's crazy!

     MITCHELL
     I'm just saying, if they're not gonna let Jackson complete his
     mission, there is no reason that we shouldn't try.

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson may be able to provide us with the intelligence
     required to ensure the success of this mission.

     MITCHELL
     He might be able to tell us where the ship is and how to get aboard
     undetected.

     CARTER
     And he must have enough knowledge of their technology by now to
     provide me with what I need to interface with the ship's control
     systems.

     O'NEILL
     Assuming he tells you.

     CARTER
     Well, why wouldn't he?

     MITCHELL
     If he knows he's not going anywhere...

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [O'Neill paces around Daniel's chair.]

     DANIEL
     That's crazy!

     O'NEILL
     That's what I said! It's crazy, it's nuts, it's whacko! But let's be
     honest, what isn't?

     DANIEL
     Jack, I'm the only one who should be going. It's too dangerous for
     anyone else.

     O'NEILL
     Not if you give me the intel we need!

     DANIEL
     It's my plan!

   [O'Neill stops pacing and moves closer to Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     It was a bad one! C'mon, Daniel! You had to know we weren't going to
     shut down that Supergate for you.

     DANIEL

     (speaking formally)
     We had no choice.

   [O'Neill rolls his eyes.]

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     Oh, now it's "we"!?

     DANIEL

     (frustrated)
     You've been in my position before...well, not this one,
     but...similar!

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I'm sure I have. But my brain's been messed with so much over
     the years, I don't remember.

     DANIEL

     (suddenly realizing)
     Wait a second, with your way, you still need to shut down the
     Supergate!

   [O'Neill makes a face.]

     O'NEILL
     C'mon, where's the ship? How does Carter fly it? Give me any other
     intel I might need to make this op a success. C'mon!

   [Daniel is ignoring him, so O'Neill crouches to make eye contact.]

     O'NEILL

     (coaxingly)
     Trusting you.

   [Daniel shakes the restraints of his chair and rolls his eyes at
   O'Neill.]

     DANIEL

     (bitingly)
     Oh, yes. I really feel the faith.

     O'NEILL
     Well, now you have to trust us. Let us finish what you started.

   [Daniel closes his eyes, then turns and looks at O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1, minus Daniel, briefs Landry and Woolsey. O'Neill stands, leaning
   on one of the empty chairs.]

     CARTER
     The Ori ship containing Merlin's weapon is parked in orbit around a
     planet with a Gate.

     MITCHELL
     We gate to the planet, use rings to get aboard.

     TEAL'C
     There is a Prior in charge of the ship, but he preaches to the
     masses on the planet daily.

     WOOLSEY
     I thought only a Prior could fly one of their ships?

     CARTER
     The systems are activated using mind control, but Daniel's given me
     what I need to get around it.

     VALA
     He's also given us instructions on how to put the final pieces
     together.

     LANDRY
     Daedalus will be standing by in Pegasus to shut down the wormhole.

     CARTER
     We use the Ori ship to dial out, and we send the weapon through.

     MITCHELL
     But not before the Odyssey beams us off.

     O'NEILL
     Now that's a plan!

     WOOLSEY
     That depends entirely on Daniel Jackson's word.

     MITCHELL
     We will know whether he's on the level before we shut off the
     Supergate. So at this point, the only thing at risk...is us.

   [Woolsey looks around at everyone, then grudgingly nods his
   acquiescence.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SECURE ROOM

   [Daniel rests with his eyes closed, meditating. He looks to the door. A
   moment later, it opens. Woolsey enters, leaving the door to the room
   open. The two guards remain outside. Daniel turns his head straight
   ahead again and closes his eyes.]

     DANIEL

     (dryly)
     No gun. Hmph. Did you bring lethal injection, high voltage, or are
     you just going to have them beam me out into space?

     WOOLSEY
     I think you understand my position.

   [Daniel faces Woolsey.]

     DANIEL

     (accusing)
     I gave Jack the information you asked for.

     WOOLSEY
     And you will be frozen in stasis until such time that SG-1's mission
     is deemed successful.

     DANIEL
     I take it, then, you're not going to allow me to just...turn back
     into my old self.

     WOOLSEY
     If the intel turns out to be reliable, you will be unfrozen and
     allowed to resume transforming, if that indeed is going to happen.

     DANIEL

     (softly)
     I see.

   [Woolsey moves closer.]

     WOOLSEY
     I'm here out of respect for you. I wanted to explain personally that
     we're about to beam you into the Ancient pod in Antarctica.

   [Daniel does not look at Woolsey; his jaw is set.]

     WOOLSEY
     Okay.

   [Woolsey moves over to the wall intercom and keys it.]

     WOOLSEY

     (into intercom)
     You're clear to beam the prisoner out now.

   [Woolsey waits, but nothing happens. He keys the intercom again.]

     WOOLSEY

     (into intercom)
     What's the hold up?

     CREWMAN

     (over intercom)
     We're having some technical problems. We can't seem to get a lock.

   [Woolsey sighs, then becomes alarmed as he looks at Daniel. Daniel's
   eyes are closed in concentration. Suddenly the restraints holding down
   his arms and legs release. He raises his arms with a determined look on
   his face. Woolsey backs against the wall. The two guards start to
   enter, aiming their weapons, but they are telekinetically pushed back
   into the corridor. Woolsey tries to run, but the doors seal shut before
   he can reach them. He turns to face Daniel, terrified. Daniel lifts
   Woolsey telekinetically a foot above the floor. Daniel walks over and
   smiles humorlessly at Woolsey.]

     DANIEL
     Not part of my plan.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill and Landry walk up the staircase from the control room to the
   briefing room and head towards Landry's office.]

     O'NEILL
     I've always been the one who "caused" the worry. Not the "worrier."

     LANDRY
     It's not easy. Don't second-guess yourself. This is the best
     possible course of action.

     O'NEILL
     Exactly! Action, good! Sitting around, bad.

     LANDRY
     Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I still worry sometimes
     too...about you.

     O'NEILL
     Well, thank you, sir.

     LANDRY
     Don't mention it.

   [Behind them, Woolsey beams into the room. He is still speechless with
   fright. Landry and O'Neill look at Woolsey.]

     O'NEILL
     I thought we fixed this thing so that wouldn't happen anymore.

   [Landry begins to laugh, then becomes concerned as O'Neill is beamed
   away.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [O'Neill is beamed into the forward part of the bridge, facing the
   window. Behind him, Daniel calmly sits in the commander's chair, his
   chin resting in his hand. The bridge is otherwise empty.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

   [O'Neill turns around to face Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Jack.

     O'NEILL

     (feigning calm)
     What's up?

     DANIEL
     Oh, I'm taking the ship.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, I see that.

   [He looks around the empty bridge.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I-I've beamed the crew safely to the surface.

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     Nice for them.

     DANIEL
     But as you've probably figured out by now, I'm going to need you.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     You know, I was just thinking how much I missed being needed.

   EXT--SPACE, EARTH ORBIT

   [Odyssey breaks orbit and enters hyperspace.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [An Ori warship is in orbit over an alien planet.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP RING ROOM

   [The other four members of SG-1 ring aboard the warship, weapons at
   ready. They cautiously head out to the corridor.]

   INT--ORI CORRIDOR

   [The team heads out in a two by two pattern. Rounding a corner, they
   meet a patrol of four Ori warriors in full battle armor. Carter and
   Mitchell take positions on either side of the hall for cover. The Ori
   soldiers scatter into alcoves for limited cover and start firing their
   staffs.]

     MITCHELL

     (yelling over weapons fire)
     All right fellas, here's the deal! We are commandeering this ship!
     We'd like for you to throw down your weapons and surrender, please!

   [Mitchell peeks around the corner and is almost hit by a blast.]

     MITCHELL
     That's a no.

   [He nods to Carter. Carter begins to fire her P-90. After a moment,
   Mitchell too fires, and they take out all four soldiers. SG-1 heads
   down the corridor, stepping over the soldier's bodies.]

     MITCHELL
     We asked nicely.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Teal'c and Carter enter the empty room. Carter instantly moves to an
   access panel near the floor and starts to interface her laptop while
   Teal'c stands guard just outside.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [Mitchell and Vala enter the chamber where Merlin's interface and the
   anti-Ori weapon components are kept. Vala moves to the weapon, checking
   it out, then over to a side table, where a number of crystals are laid
   out.]

     VALA
     Okay. Huh. This shouldn't be too bad.

     MITCHELL
     I don't know. For me, whenever there's "some assembly required", I
     inevitably find some part missing: a screw, widget, what have you.

     VALA
     Hmm. Well, according to Daniel's instructions, it all seems to be
     here.

   [Mitchell opens a small box and takes out a red spherical jewel, the
   "Sangreal" stone.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, well. I never follow instructions. Think that could be part of
     the problem?

   [Vala plucks the jewel out of Mitchell's hand and carefully places it
   back in the box.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c patrols the hall, encountering more soldiers and downing them
   with his P-90. He returns to Carter.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

     CARTER
     We're clear?

     TEAL'C
     For the moment.

     CARTER

     Okay, I've locked out the rings and secured this level. We shouldn't
     have any more company.
     (keying radio)
     Hang on, guys. If this works...

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

     CARTER

     (continuing on radio)
     ...we're about to jump into hyperspace.

   [As Mitchell watches, Vala continues to place crystals in a specified
   pattern in the center of the weapon.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Ori warship leaves orbit and enters hyperspace.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [O'Neill sits in one of the helm stations next to Daniel, absently
   flipping switches.]

     O'NEILL

     (sighing)
     Yep, just like old times.

   [Daniel looks over at O'Neill and smiles.]

     O'NEILL
     Except I'm here against my will, and you look like Marcel Marceau.

     DANIEL

     (agreeably)
     Yeah, you know, some things change, but others stay the same.

     O'NEILL
     Very good. Why'd you bother giving me the intel if you were going to
     bust out anyway?

   [Daniel clears his throat and turns his chair to look directly at
   O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Well, obviously I'm improvising at this point. I had no idea when or
     even if I was going to be able to overcome the effects of the
     anti-Prior device. Time was running out. Adria's gonna notice my
     absence and become suspicious. So sending the rest of SG-1 to get
     the device was my only choice at the time.

     O'NEILL
     Then why do this now?

     DANIEL
     Because I'm afraid the rest of the team won't be able to complete
     the mission without me.

     O'NEILL

     (snidely)
     Oh. Aren't we full of ourselves?

     DANIEL
     That, and I wasn't about to let Woolsey freeze me.

     O'NEILL
     That I understand.

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Yeah.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [Vala places one last crystal.]

     VALA
     Okay, I think that's about it.

     MITCHELL
     Hang on.

   [He reaches over and grabs a leftover crystal with a blue jewel on it
   and shows it to Vala.]

     MITCHELL
     What's this?

   [Vala glances over.]

     VALA

     (dismissively)
     Oh, I'm not sure about that one.

     MITCHELL
     See! There is always a widget left over.

     VALA
     I thought you were always one short?

     MITCHELL
     Well you'd think both was impossible, but it's not.

     VALA
     Right. Actually, I'm pretty sure that's the timing crystal that sets
     the detonation of the weapon five minutes after it's inserted.

   [Mitchell looks at Vala, and she gives a confident nod. He puts the
   crystal down next to the weapon as she sighs in satisfaction.]

     MITCHELL

     Right. Hold on that.
     (keying radio)
     Carter, status?

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Vala, Cam, we're moments from exiting hyperspace.

   [Vala picks up the red "Sangreal" jewel and holds it delicately between
   her finger and thumb.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     Roger that. We're almost done here...Check that, uh, Vala's almost
     done. I still have my doubts.

   [Vala looks affronted. Mitchell smiles at her and gestures to the
   device. She gently sets the Sangreal in the opening where the four
   sides of the device draw close. The stone begins to hang suspended in
   mid-air. Vala releases her hold and she and Mitchell watch as the red
   jewel begins to glow and hum.]

     MITCHELL
     And that means...?

     VALA
     That means the weapon's ready to be activated.

   [Vala starts to frantically look around, mostly directly her attention
   above her.]

     MITCHELL
     What?

     VALA
     Oh, I was just wondering if an Ascended Being was going to swoop
     down and...take it away.

   [She mimes someone running off with her fingers.]

     MITCHELL
     I guess they don't mind us doing their dirty work for 'em.

     VALA
     Or...

     MITCHELL
     Or what?

     VALA
     Or there's no point because I've assembled it wrongly, and it's not
     going to work.

   [Mitchell glares at Vala. She smiles at him.]

   EXT--SPACE, NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Ori warship comes out of hyperspace.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Teal'c looks toward the front window, concerned. Carter continues to
   study her laptop.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I see. It just came up on the ship's sensors.

   [Carter keys her radio and steps toward Teal'c. She too looks out the
   window while still holding her laptop.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Cam? Vala? We have a problem.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Their warship approaches the active Supergate. In front of it, another
   Ori warship lies in wait.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     What's it doing?

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

     CARTER

     (into radio, puzzled)
     I-it seems to be just sitting there, blocking our way. I'm trying to
     raise shields.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [Four armed soldiers enter the room. Mitchell and Vala instantly raise
   their weapons in a standoff.]

     VALA
     Hi there.

     MITCHELL

     (keying radio)
     Carter, I thought you sealed off this level and locked out the
     rings.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP

   [Carter and Teal'c's weapons lie on the floor of the command chair
   dais. Carter and Teal'c stand next to it. Teal'c's hands are clasped
   behind his back. Carter no longer has her laptop; her hands are raised
   in surrender. She keys the radio clasped to her vest.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Me too.

   [Adria stands in doorway, glaring at the pair. Her eyes flame.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey exits hyperspace and instantly cloaks.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [From the bridge window, the two warships and the Supergate are clearly
   visible.]

     DANIEL
     I was afraid of that. Adria must have anticipated my plan.

     O'NEILL
     They're gonna detect us.

     DANIEL
     We're cloaked.

   [O'Neill does a double-take.]

     O'NEILL
     This ship doesn't have that.

     DANIEL
     It does now. Having a ZPM helps.

   [O'Neill looks around the bridge.]

     DANIEL
     When the time comes, give the order to Daedalus.

   [Daniel stands and walks over to the forward section of the bridge.]

     O'NEILL
     We'll see.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Adria looks over to the other side of the command chair dais. An
   instant later, Daniel beams in at that spot, his hands unthreateningly
   behind his back. He smiles at Adria. She steps forward.]

     ADRIA

     (furious)
     I should never have trusted you!

     DANIEL

     They're about to shut down the Supergate and allow our ships
     through. They've assembled the weapon, and the Ancients didn't
     interfere.
     (turning to Carter and Teal'c)
     Right?

   [Carter and Teal'c are staring back at him with expressions of shock
   and betrayal. Adria watches their reactions suspiciously.]

     DANIEL

     (persistent)
     You did exactly as I said, right?

     CARTER
     Daniel, what are you doing?

     DANIEL

     (to Adria)
     We can destroy the Ancients right now, and the Ori won't even have
     to fight. I've done all of this for you.

   [Adria's eyes narrow. She moves closer to Daniel, shaking her head in
   confusion.]

     ADRIA
     Your mind is closed to me.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [Daniel's right hand whips in front of him, and he blasts Adria with
   energy. She is thrown back and collapses to the floor unconscious.
   Taking advantage of the distraction, Teal'c grabs his P-90 and
   immediately points it at Daniel.]

     CARTER
     What the hell is going on?

     DANIEL

     (breathing with effort)
     Eh, sorry about out that. I...had to be sure this...was working on
     her first.

   [Daniel reveals his other hand from behind his back. It holds the
   anti-Prior device, which is active.]

     CARTER
     You got past her personal shield!

   [Teal'c stops aiming his weapon at Daniel. Daniel smiles at them.]

     DANIEL

     (out of breath)
     Yeah. That took a lot.

   [Daniel crumples, still holding the device close to him as Carter helps
   maneuver him into the command chair. She takes the anti-Prior device
   from him.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you all right, Daniel Jackson?

     DANIEL

     (gasping)
     Yeah. Little dizzy. Look, I don't have much time left. Go arm the
     device.

   [Teal'c and Carter exchange wary looks. Daniel notices.]

     DANIEL
     Jack's on board Odyssey. He's gonna shut down the Gate. Now go!

   [Carter sets the anti-Prior device down and grabs her weapons. She and
   Teal'c leave. Daniel pants and struggles to regain his strength.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Jack, give the command.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [O'Neill sits in the helm chair. He takes no action, his expression
   calculating as he listens to Daniel's transmission. Daniel's labored
   breaths are clearly audible, and his voice is weak.]

     DANIEL

     (desperately)
     Please!...I'm running out of strength to do this.

   [O'Neill sighs. After a moment, he keys the radio.]

     O'NEILL
     Daedalus, this is General Jack O'Neill.

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [Teal'c and Carter zat the Ori soldiers facing Vala and Mitchell.]

     MITCHELL
     So, what's going on?

     CARTER
     Daniel's flying the ship.

     VALA

     (surprised)
     Daniel?

     TEAL'C
     Mmm. He wishes us to arm the weapon.

     CARTER
     General O'Neill's on board the Odyssey.

     VALA
     And...?

     CARTER
     Do it.

   [Vala nods. She goes over to the weapon, and replaces a crystal with
   the timer crystal. All the crystals pulse with a blue light.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Supergate disengages.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Daniel concentrates.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Supergate begins to power up.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [O'Neill approaches the front window, watching the Supergate activate.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CORRIDOR

   [The rest of SG-1 runs through the corridors.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Supergate kawhooshes. Daniel's warship passes the other Ori vessel
   and heads straight for the Supergate wormhole.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Daniel is slumped over in the command chair unconscious: his head
   bowed, hands clasping the armrests. His hair coloring suddenly changes
   from white to brown; his skin tone turning back to his original form.
   The team enters. Vala crouches by Adria's side. Carter rushes to
   Daniel, gently tilting his head back. She sees he is no longer a
   Prior.]

   [The ship continues to head toward the Supergate.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP CHAMBER

   [The pulse of the crystals begins to increase.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP BRIDGE

   [Mitchell checks his watch.]

     MITCHELL
     We gotta go!

     CARTER
     Sir, if you can hear me, we need to beam out now!

     VALA
     What about Adria?

   [SG-1 is beamed away. Adria remains, unconscious on the floor.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Ori warship enters the Supergate. After it is gone, the wormhole
   deactivates.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SICK BAY

   [Daniel, dressed in blue hospital scrubs, lies on one of the beds under
   the covers, his eyes closed. O'Neill and the rest of SG-1, minus
   Carter, surround his bedside. Daniel slowly awakens. O'Neill leans
   forward and tousles his hair.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, sleepyhead! What took you so long?

   [Daniel stares back at O'Neill, wide-eyed.]

     DANIEL
     What happened?

     O'NEILL

     (deadpan)
     Nothin'. Why?

     MITCHELL
     We armed the weapon. You dialed the Gate and sent the Ori ship
     through.

     TEAL'C
     Assuming it is you.

   [Daniel thinks for a moment.]

     DANIEL
     No, it's me. Merlin's gone. He sacrificed himself for this to work.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah? Prove it.

   [Daniel lifts his hand and waves his first two fingers at O'Neill.
   O'Neill looks around blankly as Daniel turns to the others.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell was that?

     DANIEL

     If I was Merlin, you would know.
     (to Vala)
     What about Adria?

     VALA
     Still on the ship.

     MITCHELL
     All right, here's a question. How do we know it worked?

     DANIEL
     Oh, we don't. Not yet.

     O'NEILL
     I think if it did work, the Ancients would feel obligated to...give
     us a fruit basket...or, uh, like a gift certificate,
     or...so-something like that.

   [O'Neill's voice trails off as the team exchange looks.]

     VALA
     Maybe the reason why they let us do it is because they knew it
     wouldn't work.

     DANIEL
     Or maybe because they knew it would and wanted it to. There's no
     point in guessing.

     TEAL'C
     Even if it is successful, there are still many Priors with great
     power and vast armies of warriors bent on converting this galaxy. It
     will be very difficult to convince them their gods are dead.

     VALA
     If they're dead.

   [Teal'c nods, conceding the point. Mitchell moves to the intercom and
   activates it.]

     MITCHELL

     (into intercom)
     Carter, Sunshine is awake.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Carter sits at a helm station, alone on the bridge.]

     CARTER
     That's good. Is he okay?

     MITCHELL

     (over intercom)
     Well, he's grumpy.

     CARTER
     Can you ask him how he managed to cloak this ship?

   INT--ODYSSEY SICK BAY

   [Mitchell turns to Daniel. Daniel shrugs, raising his eyebrows in
   ignorance.]

     MITCHELL

     (into intercom)
     He said magicians don't reveal their secrets.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MITCHELL

     (continuing)
     Hey, is that Ori ship still hanging around out there?

     CARTER
     Yeah, it's still out there. I sent a message to Earth telling them
     that we were going...

   [A strange buzzing can be heard. Carter looks alarmed.]

     CARTER
     Uh, guys? You better get up here.

   [She moves to the front window.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Supergate activates.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [The rest of SG-1 and O'Neill join Carter on the bridge.]

     CARTER
     Incoming wormhole.

   [The team watches as six warships come through the Supergate to join
   the one already there.]

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Yeah. I think that went well.

     MITCHELL
     We knew eliminating the Ori might not stop their followers.

     DANIEL
     I still think it was the right thing to do.

     MITCHELL
     We may have made things worse right now. But in the long run, it
     could be our only chance to win the war.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Supergate deactivates as the seven Ori warships jump into
   hyperspace.]

   FADE OUT
