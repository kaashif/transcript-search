   TEASER

   INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter stands between Teal'c and O'Neill as she delivers an update on
   the galaxy-wide Goa'uld conflict.]

     CARTER
     The war between Ba'al and the System Lords has reached a critical
     stage. According to Tok'ra intelligence, Bastet and Olokun are dead,
     Morrigan has capitulated, and Lord Yu and Amaterasu are rallying
     their armies for what will probably be their last stand.

     TEAL'C
     As we predicted, the Jaffa were no match for the Kull warriors.

     CARTER

     (walks behind O'Neill to stand between him and Daniel)
     The Tok'ra also thought we should know, in the face of imminent
     defeat, some of the System Lords are actively seeking out areas of
     refuge. Planets they abandoned long ago are now being scouted as
     possible sanctuaries.

     O'NEILL
     And this affects us...how?

     DANIEL
     One of these planets, which used to fall under the domain of the
     System Lord Ares, also happens to be the place where the Tok'ra
     dropped off one Harry Maybourne two years ago.

     O'NEILL

     (staring at Daniel, O'Neill deliberately repeats himself)
     And this affects us...how?

   [Daniel looks disapproving and glances to Carter for back-up.]

     CARTER
     The Tok'ra have their hands full with more pressing matters. They
     strongly suggest we get to Maybourne before the Goa'uld do.

   [O'Neill remains unconvinced.]

     TEAL'C
     If we do not retrieve him, Harry Maybourne faces certain capture.

   [O'Neill just looks at him, unmoved.]

     TEAL'C

     (emphatic)
     Torture, interrogation...Perhaps even death.

     O'NEILL

     (grudging)
     Alright, fine. Go get him.

   [Carter rolls her eyes in exasperation as O'Neill finally capitulates
   and then walks out of the briefing.]

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

   [Daniel, Carter and Teal'c leave immediately to prepare for their
   mission.]

   WORMHOLE

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

   [Carter and Teal'c exit the Stargate on Maybourne's world. The Stargate
   is in a lush woodland glade. In the bright sunshine, it's beautiful.
   SG-1 take time to survey their immediate surroundings before moving
   off.]

     CARTER

     (to Daniel)
     According to the Tok'ra, the people of this world are fairly
     primitive.

     DANIEL
     No phones, no lights, no motorcars. I betcha Maybourne just jumps at
     the chance to leave.

   [SG-1 approach the DHD set some distance away from the Stargate.]

     TEAL'C
     What of the other inhabitants?

     CARTER
     We'll relocate them. We may not have a lot of time. Ares could be
     here in a matter of days.

   [Men armed with crossbow-type weapons begin to emerge from the long
   grasses beyond the DHD. SG-1 are quickly surrounded. Carter and Teal'c
   raise their weapons defensively. Behind them, Daniel sees a woman
   bursting out of the grasses, draws and aims his sidearm at her.]

     CARTER

     (assertive)
     We don't mean you any harm!

   [The two factions are at a stand-off.]

     TEAL'C
     We are allies of the Tok'ra.

     DANIEL
     We're just, uh, looking for a friend of ours. Harry Maybourne. Maybe
     you've heard of him? Shifty fella, beady eyes? No?

     GARAN

     (commanding)
     You will follow us to the village and meet with King Arkhan. He will
     discern your true intentions.

   [Garan moves off, leading the way as her people warily close in on
   SG-1. Carter exchanges a measuring glance with Daniel, and they
   follow.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [King Arkhan's village is constructed of heavy grey stone, medieval in
   appearance, with heraldic banners draped from walls on the upper level
   of the dwellings. People are bustling to and fro, with evidence
   everywhere of communal living. Tables, food stuffs, water, a stove --
   these are all readily accessible in the public areas. A blonde woman in
   a long gown draws water from a fountain as SG-1 are led into the
   communal space behind her. Carter is on point, with Daniel beside her,
   Teal'c at the rear.]

     DANIEL

     (of Garan)
     Not exactly the trusting type.

     TEAL'C
     Which leads me to wonder whether Harry Maybourne is still alive.

     CARTER
     Presumably the Tok'ra put in a good word for him.

     DANIEL

     (looking behind him curiously)
     Maybe we should get them to do the same for us.

   [SG-1 are taken into an open hall with a dais at the far end of it.
   There is a yellow and black shield mounted on the wall above the throne
   along with swords and other weapons. On the dais, several women
   surround a figure seated on a throne. One woman steps back, revealing
   the face of the 'king'. Eyes closed, he's blissfully enjoying a bright
   red fruit.]

   [Teal'c, Daniel and Carter each stare at 'King Arkhan' in disbelief and
   disapproval.]

     CARTER

     (shocked)
     Maybourne!

   [Maybourne's eyes snap open and he hastily swallows the fruit.]

     GARAN

     (to SG-1)(cold)
     This is King Arkhan.
     (to Maybourne)
     My Lord, our hunting party encountered these (disapproving)
     off-worlders by the Gate.

     MAYBOURNE

     (affable and amused)
     Hey, guys! Long time no see!
     (laughing)

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--KING ARKHAN'S HALL, DAY

   [Surrounded by his adoring female acolytes, bedecked in furs and a
   primitive helm-cum-crown, Maybourne is laughing, patently amused at his
   visitors. Garan protectively stands guard over SG-1, her reverence for
   Maybourne readily apparent.]

     MAYBOURNE
     I shoulda known. I shoulda known you'd be the ones to come.

     DANIEL

     (snarky)
     You were expecting us?

     MAYBOURNE
     Uh, sort of. Where's Jack?

     CARTER
     General O'Neill's back at the SGC.

     MAYBOURNE

     No kidding.
     (pulls a face)
     "General O'Neill?" That doesn't sound right. Still, good for Jack.
     Nice to hear he's doing so well for himself.

     TEAL'C

     (rigid with disapproval)
     As, evidently, are you.

     MAYBOURNE

     Uh, this.
     (looks down deprecatingly at his lavish furs)
     Yes, well, uh, it's a long story.

   [He rises from his throne, throwing back the furs as he calls out to
   his people.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Food! Drinks for our guests!

   [Garan strides out of the hall into the communal space of the village,
   briskly summoning villagers to do Maybourne's bidding. Maybourne leads
   the members of SG-1 across to the large table set outside his hall.]

     CARTER

     (irritated)
     We don't have time for this!

     MAYBOURNE

     Uh, you should try one of these.
     (reaches into a basket to retrieve a small fruit)
     It's called, um ...

     GARAN
     Ojun fruit.

     MAYBOURNE
     Right. It's sort of a cross between a guava and a mango.

     DANIEL

     (sarcastic)
     Sort of a guango?

     MAYBOURNE

     (quite taken with the suggestion)
     (to Daniel)
     I like that!

   [He bounds up onto a bench and issues a proclamation.]

     MAYBOURNE
     People! Henceforth, ojun fruit shall be called...guango! So shall it
     be!

   [The villagers cheer and applaud as Maybourne bounds down from the
   bench. He turns to Carter, who appears speechless at his antics.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (jovial)
     I get to name all kinds of stuff. You should see the Grateful Dead
     Burial Ground.

     CARTER
     Maybourne, you have to get out of here. You're in danger.

     MAYBOURNE

     I know. The Goa'uld are coming.
     (ignoring Carter's consternation, he again turns his attention to
     the guango)
     Now, you should peel it before you eat it. I find the skin kind of
     tart.

     CARTER

     (startled and annoyed)
     You know about the Goa'uld?

     MAYBOURNE
     Oh, yeah.(sits at the table to peel the guango)

   [SG-1 gather closely around Maybourne, Daniel sitting on the table near
   him.]

     TEAL'C
     You were warned by the Tok'ra.

     MAYBOURNE

     (irritable)
     I haven't heard from the Tok'ra since they dropped me off.

     CARTER
     Then how?

     MAYBOURNE
     I can read the future.

   [Incredulous, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c roll their eyes in disbelief.
   Teal'c turns his back and Daniel buries his head against his knees.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Really!

     CARTER

     (suspicious and annoyed)
     What are you trying to pull?

     GARAN
     He speaks the truth. King Arkhan is a prophet. He foresaw your
     arrival and the hand you will play in defeating our enemy.

     MAYBOURNE
     Garan's right. It's all part of the prophecy!

     CARTER
     Maybourne, what the hell is going on here?

     MAYBOURNE

     (thinks it over for a moment)
     Let's go for a walk.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

   [Maybourne leads Daniel, Carter and Teal'c through woodlands towards
   the ruins of a structure.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Okay. Here we are.

   [There is a tall column, with several piles of tumbled rocks scattered
   around it. All of the ruins are of the same dark grey stone the village
   is constructed from.]

     MAYBOURNE
     I found this place about, oh, uh, ten months ago when I was on an
     afternoon stroll.

   [As Maybourne draws SG-1 into the ruins, it becomes clear that the
   column is only one of many, each of them carved with clearly visible
   Ancient text.]

     TEAL'C
     It is quite a distance from the village.

     MAYBOURNE
     I enjoy long walks.

     CARTER

     (withering)
     Right! Long walks, rainy nights, and candlelit dinners. Why are we
     here, Maybourne?

   [Daniel goes over to one of the columns and begins to inspect it while
   Carter confronts Maybourne.]

     DANIEL

     This writing is in Ancient.
     (to Maybourne)
     What do the locals know about these ruins?

     MAYBOURNE
     Well, not much. They generally avoid the area because it's close to
     the naquadah mines. The site of their former enslavement. Bad luck,
     and all.

     DANIEL

     (engrossed)
     This is incredible.

     MAYBOURNE

     (dismissive)
     No, no, this is, uh, interesting. This...
     (he pats Daniel's arm to draw his attention, pointing to something
     in the distance)
     ...is incredible.

   [Fascinated, Daniel follows Maybourne over to a nearby column, which he
   begins to read.]

     TEAL'C
     What is it?

     MAYBOURNE
     It's a record of the planet's history, covering major events. Only,
     some of them haven't happened yet.

     CARTER
     What are you talking about?

     MAYBOURNE
     They have a complicated lunar calendar. Took me a while to figure it
     out.

   [Daniel begins to circle the column, reading a second panel as
   Maybourne tries to explain his discovery.]

     MAYBOURNE
     But once I did, I realised there were references in the text to
     things that are gonna happen in the future.

   [Standing side by side, Carter and Teal'c just look steadily back at
   him.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Yeah, I know. It sounds crazy. I didn't think much of it either at
     the time, but then this big meteor shower happened exactly on the
     date the stone predicted.

     CARTER
     You're sure you're reading it correctly?

   [Daniel has reached the final panel on his circuit of the four-sided
   column.]

     MAYBOURNE
     My skills may not compare with Doctor Jackson's, but over the years
     I've picked up a decent understanding of Ancient writing. As a
     result of my translations, I predicted a major flood would destroy
     the village unless I could convince the elders to move to higher
     ground.

     CARTER

     (sarcastic)
     And of course you told them where these predictions came from.

     MAYBOURNE
     No. Well, not in so many words.

   [Carter is disgusted.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Look, these are simple people. This stuff would mean nothing to
     them. I had to play the role of a prophet to...to convince them.

     TEAL'C
     And out of gratitude they made you king.

     MAYBOURNE

     (moves over to Carter and Teal'c, unrepentant)
     Like I said, it was their idea.

     DANIEL
     Well, he's partly right, anyway. It is a historical log. On the
     first moon of the forty-fifth cycle, the ground will tremble and
     devastation will be wrought."

     MAYBOURNE

     Yeah, yeah, yeah, big earthquake, couple of years back. Before my
     time.
     (to Daniel)
     Skip ahead. We're on the fifty-fourth cycle.

     DANIEL

     (walks around to the second panel and begins to read)
     "Commencing the third moon of the fifty-fourth cycle ..."

     MAYBOURNE
     Which is around now, give or take a few days.

     DANIEL
     "... the oppressors of old will return ..."

     MAYBOURNE
     That's the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     "... to seek dominion over the land. Those of a distant world will
     come ..."

     MAYBOURNE
     I'm guessing that's you guys.

     DANIEL
     "... to vanquish the evil and restore order once again."

     MAYBOURNE
     You see? They come, you defeat them, happy ending! That's the
     prophecy!

     CARTER
     Sorry, but we didn't come here to fight the Goa'uld. We should get
     going.

     DANIEL

     (intrigued, insistent)(to Carter)
     Actually, um, this is interesting, and, uh, there's a lot here to
     translate.

   [Carter nods recognition that Daniel won't be budged until he's had a
   chance to check this out.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [The village is set on high ground with hills rising steeply around it.
   The verdant valley floor below is rough, rock-strewn terrain cut
   through by a river gorge. Looking impatient and concerned, Carter and
   Teal'c are patrolling through the village.]

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     Sam?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

   [Daniel is once again circling this mesmerising Ancient column.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Maybourne was right.

     CARTER
     What do you mean?

     DANIEL
     Well, from what I've been able to decipher, it's pretty clear. The
     script on these walls is a historical log compiled by an Ancient who
     traveled through time to study the evolution of life on this world.

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Daniel, we know the Ancients experimented with time travel but we
     have no evidence that they actually mastered it.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, well, we do now.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     You see, to the best of my knowledge, these writings are only a
     couple of hundred years old.

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     Which means they were carved after the Goa'uld had already left.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     But the Ancients pre-date the Goa'uld.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Right, so the only logical explanation is that an Ancient traveled
     to the future and then back to a time not too long ago.

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     CARTER

     (sceptical)
     I don't know, Daniel.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     There are references to the time travel device itself. Now, it's
     described as being inside a small ship. Now if I'm right, it may
     still be here. I think it's worth a look.

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Alright. We're on our way.

   [Carter exchanges a serious look with Teal'c. Things are not going
   according to plan.]

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

   [Daniel takes a final, lingering look at the Ancient column, bites his
   lip, then heads off to begin the search for the Ancient ship. Teal'c
   makes his way through heavy undergrowth. Daniel picks his way slowly
   down a dry, rock-strewn stream bed. Carter is walking through sunlit
   trees.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Daniel?

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     CARTER
     We've been at it a while. Are you sure it's around here?

     DANIEL
     Just give it a little more time.

     CARTER
     I hate to say it, Daniel, but we can't risk staying much longer.

   [Looking determined, Daniel dashes off. Teal'c continues to search
   through the heaviest undergrowth, peering intently around him. A tiny
   gleam of vivid white light catches his eye. He turns towards it, and
   sees a clear reflection of sunlight. He begins to push through the
   undergrowth, breaking a path towards the reflecting surface. Carter
   ducks beneath a tree branch, checks her watch and radios.]

     CARTER
     I'm scrubbing the search. Fall back to the Gate.

     DANIEL
     Sam?

   [Teal'c starts to clear undergrowth away from a hidden object. He
   strips away greenery to reveal metal.]

     CARTER

     (heard on Teal'c's radio)
     Daniel, we have no way of knowing when the Goa'uld will get here.

     DANIEL

     (heard on Teal'c's radio)
     It could be days.

     CARTER

     (heard on Teal'c's radio)
     And it could be hours.

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)(tense, excited)
     Colonel Carter, DanielJackson. I have found something.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [The hatch in the stern of the Ancient ship begins to lower. Carter
   cautiously moves forward, her P-90 raised as she checks out the
   interior. Teal'c covers her with the zat, while Daniel covers their
   rear. Carter leads them into the pitch dark interior. As they step
   inside, lights automatically begin to activate, keeping pace with their
   slow entry. Daniel hangs back, his hand resting on a waist-high device
   in the centre of the ship. It's a podium of some kind, with metal
   panels on top and the familiar intricate Ancient carving covering what
   looks like a pale glass end panel. There are grey seats lining each
   wall of the ship. The cockpit is open, the flight console bristling
   with advanced Ancient technology.]

     CARTER
     It certainly looks like a ship.

     TEAL'C
     These appear to be flight controls.

     DANIEL

     (standing with both hands resting on the Ancient device)
     So what's this?

   [Carter and Teal'c come back to check out the device.]

     CARTER
     Could be the time device.

     TEAL'C
     It bears little resemblance to Ancient designs we have previously
     encountered.

     DANIEL
     Well, judging from Maybourne's wall, it must have worked at some
     point.

     CARTER
     Well, I'm guessing it must manifest some sort of energy field that
     encompasses the entire ship. Allowing the traveler to literally fly
     through time.

     DANIEL

     (curious and reaching for a control)
     I wonder...

     CARTER

     (panicking)
     Ah-ah! Let's not touch anything just yet. I'm kinda fond of this
     era.

     DANIEL
     Okay, so what do we do?

     CARTER

     We bring it back.
     (begins to feel around on the roof of the ship)
     Judging by the dimensions, it looks like it was actually designed to
     fit through the Gate.

     DANIEL
     Okay, how do we get it there?

     TEAL'C
     This vessel appears to be relatively undamaged. The engine may yet
     be functional.

     CARTER
     This is Ancient technology. We'd need an Ancient to make it work.

     DANIEL

     (thoughtful)
     Or someone...close.

   [Carter smiles, catching that Daniel means O'Neill.]

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

   [O'Neill steps out of the Stargate, hefting a large pack on his
   shoulder, his P-90 casually slung. He's wearing sunglasses. Maybourne
   and some of the villagers are waiting to greet him. At Maybourne's
   signal, musicians strike up a tune. Daniel and Teal'c are standing by
   the DHD, watching all of this unfold. O'Neill comes down the steps from
   the Stargate and strolls over to Maybourne.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Jack! It's great to see ya! How long's it been?

     O'NEILL

     (snarky)
     Oh, since that time you got us stranded off-world and tried to kill
     me.

     MAYBOURNE

     (chuckling)
     That takes me back! Aha, I guess congratulations are in order. You
     made general.

     O'NEILL
     You made king!

     MAYBOURNE
     Right, well, it's, uh, not a contest.

     O'NEILL
     Do you mind? These guys are torturing that ditty.

     MAYBOURNE

     Right. Uh, take five, guys.
     (the musicians break off)
     I, uh, taught ' 'em that expression.

     O'NEILL
     Ah.

     MAYBOURNE

     (leading O'Neill away)
     I'm, uh, hoping that you can stay for a while, check out the sights.

   [The only sight O'Neill is taking in are two pretty young villagers
   giggling nearby.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Take in the culture. I want you to feel at home here.

     O'NEILL
     Harry, you're aware of the fact that this place is gonna be overrun
     by a gaggle of bad guys soon?

     MAYBOURNE
     Yeah, well, maybe.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Carter told me about this prophecy stuff. It's not gonna go
     down that way, y'know.

     MAYBOURNE
     Oh, come on, Jack, you've defeated System Lords before.

     O'NEILL
     No! You've got to tell these people they've gotta start packing.
     We'll take as many as we can.

     MAYBOURNE
     I can't. I already told them you'd save the day.

   [O'Neill stops Maybourne in his tracks. Daniel and Teal'c stop a few
   feet away from them, the villagers looking on in the distance.
   Maybourne signals reassuringly to them, indicating they should hold
   back while he and O'Neill talk.]

     O'NEILL
     Lemme ask you a question. Did this prophecy mention anything about
     casualties? How many people would die in the fighting?

     MAYBOURNE
     It's not really that detailed.

     O'NEILL

     (pointed)
     Does it say anything about the king surviving at all?

     MAYBOURNE

     (uncertain)
     Actually, there's, um, no reference to me specifically. I just
     assumed that...

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Do you really wanna take that chance, Harry? D'you wanna roll
     those dice?

     MAYBOURNE

     (quiet and fretful as he looks at his trusting subjects)
     It's not gonna be easy to convince them, Jack.

     O'NEILL

     You can do it, Harry, you're the king.
     (puts his hand on Maybourne's shoulder)
     And remember...it's good to be king.

   [He pats Maybourne's shoulder.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [Carter is reaching above her head, working on the roof of the Ancient
   ship. Pale blue cables are dangling from various points in the roof.
   She turns as O'Neill and Daniel come aboard.]

     O'NEILL
     Nice ride!

     DANIEL

     (grinning)
     Yeah, Ancients like to fly in style.

   [O'Neill heads for the cockpit, where he pauses appreciatively, soaking
   in the sight of all these cool new toys.]

     O'NEILL

     (gloating)
     Nice!
     (un-holsters his P-90 and sits in the pilot's seat)
     Woo-hoo!

   [Daniel hovers attentively at O'Neill's side, looking slightly
   nervous.]

     O'NEILL
     You're gonna have to help me out here, Carter. Got any quarters?

     CARTER
     Unfortunately I can't help you with this one, Sir, you're on your
     own.

     O'NEILL
     Fine! How do we know we're not gonna end up back at the Alamo?

     CARTER

     (slightly sarcastic)
     Um, well, for one thing, that was on Earth. But more importantly
     I've separated the time device from the control circuits (hesitates)
     I think. (comes forward to join Daniel and O'Neill) Concentrate on
     powering up the engines.

     O'NEILL
     Concentrate?

   [Daniel and Carter wait expectantly, leaning forward intently while
   O'Neill closes his eyes and concentrates. Time passes.]

     O'NEILL

     (loud)
     Got nothin'.

   [Daniel and Carter jump at this sudden announcement]

     DANIEL

     Uh...Come on, Jack. You've already proven that the Ancient gene you
     possess allows you to operate Ancient technology. It's no different
     than, uh, the device in Antarctica. Just...
     (closes his eyes and reaches out an expressive hand)(slow, dramatic)
     Fffff...ocus your mind.

   [Carter and O'Neill both turn slowly and stare at him in mild
   disbelief. Daniel looks self-conscious. Carter hides a smile while
   O'Neill impatiently pulls off his cap. O'Neill closes his eyes again
   and composes himself. After a moment, lights begin to appear on the
   flight console and the engines hum.]

     DANIEL
     Good. Good!

   [As the engine noise builds, Daniel and Carter start to get excited.
   Then everything stops and fades to black and silence again. Daniel and
   Carter deflate.]

     DANIEL

     (sighs)
     Not so good.

   [Carter glances at him in fond amusement, trying to hide another smile.
   O'Neill steals a swift sidelong glance at Daniel, embarrassed.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [The villagers are quietly preparing for the coming battle. A young
   woman carries a wicker basket full of knives over to the communal table
   set outside King Arkhan's hall. Then Maybourne appears with Teal'c. All
   the boxes and baskets, all the rich contents, far more than merely
   weapons, are his.]

     MAYBOURNE

     Tempus fugit, girls, tempus fugit.
     (to Teal'c)
     I sure collected a lot of stuff in only a couple of years. Guess I'm
     a bit of a pack rat.

     TEAL'C

     (stern)
     When do you intend to address your people?

     MAYBOURNE

     (regretful, shifty)
     I'm getting to that. It's just...Well, I'm thinking about what I'm
     gonna say.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps you should consider telling the truth.

     MAYBOURNE
     That's one strategy.

     TEAL'C
     Whatever you decide, we are running out of time. We must leave soon.

     MAYBOURNE

     Yeah. I know. I know.
     (turns away and goes back into his hall)(to villagers)
     No, no, just leave that. That stuff over there!

   [The two men head over to collect what he ordered them to pack for
   him.]

   [Garan, the leader of the hunting party and King Arkhan's most loyal
   subject, is watching silently from the shadows. Unseen, she has
   overheard Maybourne's encounter with Teal'c and has made a decision to
   take action on it. She strides off through the village.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [Carter is standing by the time device while O'Neill sits in the pilot
   seat.]

     CARTER

     The primary power source is depleted. We need to reroute the
     controls to the secondary output which was originally designed to
     power the time device.
     (reaches up to adjust a control in the roof)

     O'NEILL

     (uncomprehending)
     Of course...we do.

   [Daniel sits near O'Neill. He is tense and anxious, wanting this to
   work.]

     CARTER
     Okay. Try it now, Sir.

   [O'Neill swivels in the pilot seat and prepares himself. Hands braced
   against the flight console, he closes his eyes and concentrates
   fiercely. Daniel watches O'Neill as the ship's systems activate, while
   Carter checks the cable connections she has made rerouting the power.
   The flickering lights on the flight console steady and the engine hum
   begins to increase. Suddenly sparks flare over Carter's head and she
   flinches, covering her face. Daniel and O'Neill hunker down as circuits
   blow and the sparks rain down. The engines cut out and the ship fades
   to black.]

     CARTER
     Damn it!

   [In the pilot seat, O'Neill looks down at the blank console and lets
   out a gusty sigh.]

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

   [O'Neill leads Carter and Daniel to the front of the Ancient ship. It's
   almost completely concealed in the dense foliage surrounding it.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     I'm just not that familiar with Ancient technology. I need a little
     time.

     O'NEILL

     That is one thing I can't give you, Carter.
     (hunkers down and begins to open his pack)

     DANIEL

     (pissed)
     You can't be serious.

     CARTER

     (hunkering down beside O'Neill)(persuasive)
     Sir, this technology is too valuable to lose.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, what do you want me to do? Call in reinforcements? It's not
     like we're throwing down with a couple of Jaffa. We're taking on a
     System Lord and his band of merry bad guys. Inside and out. (hands
     Carter and Daniel blocks of C-4 explosive from his pack)(emphatic as
     he points to the Ancient ship) I want that thing gone!

   [They hear sudden rustling from the undergrowth and get to their feet,
   raising weapons as they assume defensive positions. Garan and her
   hunting party burst from the trees and surround them.]

     GARAN

     (confrontational)
     Surrender your weapons, or die where you stand!

     O'NEILL
     Oh, if I had a nickel!

     GARAN
     Lower your weapons.

     O'NEILL

     I...
     (clears fronds of foliage from his face)
     ...don't think so.

     GARAN
     We will not allow you to take King Arkhan from us.

     O'NEILL
     Good King Arkhan is a fraud.

     HUNTSMAN
     Our king is wise. He is a seer.

     O'NEILL
     He may be your king, but he's no seer.

     DANIEL

     (forceful, persuasive)
     He can only interpret what's been written on the pillars of the
     temple ruins not far from here. Now, those writings hold the
     prophecies, and anyone who can read them can make the same
     predictions.

     GARAN

     (angry)
     That is a lie.

     DANIEL
     Why don't we just go back to the village and let King Arkhan explain
     everything?

   [Daniel's suggestion makes an impression on Garan. She trusts Arkhan
   implicitly and she'll do this.]

     GARAN

     (suspicious, insistent)
     First lower your weapons.

   [Daniel lowers his pistol, but when he looks around, he sees that
   Carter and O'Neill still have their aimed at the villagers.]

     DANIEL
     Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL

     (coaxing)
     They're not gonna shoot.
     (leans forward to look at Garan)
     Are ya?

   [Garan exchanges a measuring look with the huntsman who spoke up in
   defence of King Arkhan, and slowly begins to lower her weapon, although
   there's no suggestion she's relaxing her guard. At her signal, the
   other hunters lower their weapons too. Carter and O'Neill lower their
   guns, keeping paced with the hunters.]

     O'NEILL

     (staring at the suspicious, resolute Garan)
     God, I miss goin' offworld! Oh, yeah!

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [The villagers are bustling through their daily lives. In the middle of
   it all, Maybourne is crouched down, talking gently to two small
   children, a girl and a boy. The little girl gives him a posy of yellow
   wild flowers and he smiles his thanks.]

     O'NEILL
     Who'd'a thunk?

     MAYBOURNE

     (startled by O'Neill's comment, had forgotten he was there)
     Oh, hey, Jack. I, uh, spoke with Garan. I was sorry to hear about
     what happened at the ship. Believe me, I had nothing to do with it.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastic)
     I know, Harry, you're always the victim in these things.

   [O'Neill and Maybourne begin to walk into the royal hall.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (earnest, sincere)
     Okay, look, I'll admit that when I first found the ruins, I did plan
     to use them to my personal advantage. But all that changed once I
     became King Arkhan the First.

     O'NEILL

     (incredulous, scathing)
     Oh, please!

     MAYBOURNE
     It's true, Jack. I care about these people. I want to help them.

     O'NEILL
     Then tell 'em the truth. Come clean on all this stuff.

     MAYBOURNE
     I've already arranged for an assembly with the, uh, village elders.
     I'm gonna tell them we have to leave.

   [Maybourne turns away, leaving O'Neill uncertain whether to believe him
   or not.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [The villagers crowd around the communal space, Garan at the front of
   them. On the upper level, Maybourne walks along a balcony to stand at
   the top of a flight of stairs. O'Neill and SG-1 wait watchfully at his
   side.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (to O'Neill)
     Well, here goes nothing.

   [He straightens his shoulders and walks slowly down the stairs to
   beckon his people closer to him.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (addressing the villagers)
     My friends. I wish I were here under better circumstances, but the
     fact is, I come before you all to deliver a warning. The village is
     in danger, and the time has come for us to leave.

   [The villagers murmur and protest in shock and agitation, refusing to
   accept this dictat.]

     MAYBOURNE

     We must abandon our world. Arrangements are being made to help us...
     (turns questioningly to the sceptical O'Neill and SG-1, who nod
     agreement)
     ...temporarily relocate to a safe place.

   [The villagers' agitation increases. They don't believe what they're
   hearing.]

     VILLAGER
     But the prophecy was clear. The enemy will be defeated.

     MAYBOURNE
     Ah, yes, uh, the prophecy was clear, but only up to a certain point.
     After that it was somewhat, uh, unclear -- uh, sort of, uh, murky
     clarity.

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Carter wince at this poor performance. The
   villagers are beginning to sound a little angry and Maybourne is deeply
   reluctant.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Of course the enemy will be defeated. But...there is a chance that
     some of us may get hurt or even killed in the process, and I am not
     willing to...

     HUNTSMAN
     Impossible! You assured us we would be safe!

   [The huntsman from Garan's party looks around as the other villagers
   mutter their support of his assertion.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Yes, I, I remember that. Uh, however...

   [Looking at the faces of these trusting people, Maybourne just can't
   lie to them. He looks to O'Neill for help. O'Neill urges him to go for
   it and Maybourne goes down the last few remaining steps until he stands
   among his people.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (grave, sorrowful)
     The truth is, I've not been entirely honest with you. I am not a
     seer. I don't possess insight into the future or divine powers that
     set me apart. I'm just a regular guy, no more or less special than
     any of you.

     HUNTSMAN
     But the prophecies!

     MAYBOURNE
     The prophecies don't come from me. They come from the walls of the
     old temple, written in stone for all to see. I have the ability to
     interpret these writings and, with the proper understanding, any of
     you could do the same.

   [The villagers are sober and upset. Even Garan's confidence and belief
   are rocked by this grave admission. O'Neill seems approving of their
   reactions -- Maybourne is getting his comeuppance.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (sincere)
     I...am a pretender. I took...advantage of you and...
     (takes off his crown and stares at it)
     ...and for that I am deeply sorry.
     (begins to turn from the villagers)

     GARAN

     (pushing forward to address Maybourne)
     What about the design for the new watermill? Was this written on the
     temple wall as well?

     MAYBOURNE
     Uh, no, that was from me.

     GARAN

     (to the villagers)
     And our new medicines? Our legal code? The irrigation system? Were
     these things also found in the ruins?

     MAYBOURNE
     No.

     GARAN

     (beginning to smile triumphantly)
     These were not the acts of a pretender, but of a leader!

   [The villagers enthusiastically second her. O'Neill can't believe his
   eyes.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (smiling)
     Uh, guys, I'm touched, really.

     GARAN
     What does it matter where the prophecies came from? All we need know
     is that each one of them has been fulfilled, as this latest will be
     fulfilled.

     MAYBOURNE

     (warning)
     Well, now, let's not get carried away here.

     GARAN

     (to the villagers)
     We will defeat this enemy. And we will do so under the leadership of
     our great king, Arkhan the First!
     (punches the air with her fist, leading a rousing chant the
     villagers quickly join)
     Arkhan! Arkhan! Arkhan!

   [Maybourne is stunned by this response, genuinely at a loss as he looks
   to O'Neill. And then he shrugs and accepts it. O'Neill is absolutely
   horrified at this reversal of fortune. Maybourne wins again! And he
   puts the crown back on his head.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [Normal life has resumed in the village. People stand around in
   clusters, talking quietly or working together on one of their usual
   duties. Maybourne walks with O'Neill, SG-1 behind them.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Uh, Jack. Look, uh, sorry about that.

     O'NEILL
     Not my problem, Harry. If these folks don't wanna go, they don't
     have to go. Teal'c? You and Daniel head on back, secure the Gate.
     Carter? You and I'll take care of the ship.

     MAYBOURNE
     Now, Jack, uh, Jack, wait a minute. Uh, I know it sounds crazy, but
     Garan was right about the prophecies. They have all come true.

     O'NEILL
     Harry, we're not stayin.' And if you want to come with us, I suggest
     you get your royal butt to the Gate.

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

   [Daniel and Teal'c run out of the trees. They can hear the chevrons
   locking on the Stargate, crouching down in the long grasses as the gate
   activates and two Jaffa begin to cautiously lead the advance party into
   the clearing.]

   EXT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [O'Neill is closing in on the Ancient ship.]

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     Jack? Come in.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

     DANIEL
     Uh, we've got a little problem here.

   [There are now fourteen Jaffa taking up defensive positions around the
   Stargate. An imposing Jaffa warrior stands in front of the event
   horizon, looking around him. He is Ares' First Prime.]

     DANIEL
     Ares' Jaffa just came through the Gate. We're cut off.

   EXT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [O'Neill and Carter listen intently to Daniel's report.]

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     If you blow the ship now, you'll give away your position.

     CARTER
     Guess we're stayin' for a while.

   [Pissed, O'Neill sighs and heads for the Ancient ship.]

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

   [Ares' grim First Prime, Trelak, moves out to join his men as they
   begin to spread out from the Stargate in search of the natives.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [The villagers scatter in fear as a Jaffa patrol marches towards King
   Arkhan's hall. Trelak himself is their leader. He goes right up to the
   throne, where Maybourne rises to greet him.]

     MAYBOURNE

     (friendly, welcoming)
     Welcome, strangers. I am King Arkhan the First. It is with a joyful
     heart and open arms that we welcome you...

     TRELAK
     I am Trelak, First Prime to the great Lord Ares. Your god...who will
     be returning to reclaim this land and his loyal followers.

     MAYBOURNE
     Of course, of course. Glad tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort and
     joy.

   [Trelak begins to look around the environs of the hall and the village.
   The women who surround Maybourne's throne do their best not to react,
   except for one dark-haired young woman who drops her head, looking
   angry as Maybourne does his best to defuse the situation. The villagers
   are gathered outside the hall, listening to all that is being said and
   threatened.]

     TRELAK
     Lord Ares demands nothing short of complete obedience from both you
     and your people. Any resistance will be dealt with harshly.

     MAYBOURNE
     Understood.

     TRELAK
     Gather your subjects. Inform them of our arrival.

   [Daniel and Teal'c stand in the crowd, their faces hidden by dark
   hooded cloaks.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Of course. I'll address them immediately.

   [Trelak sees the angry young woman and challenges her.]

     TRELAK
     Do you have something to say, slave?

     WOMAN

     (through gritted teeth)
     I am not a slave.

   [In the crowd, Daniel watches this confrontation with concern.]

     MAYBOURNE
     I apologise. My servant spoke out of turn. She will be punished.

     TRELAK

     (smiling unpleasantly)
     Of course she will.

   [Two Jaffa come forward to seize the woman and force her to her knees.
   She's frightened as they level their staff weapons at her. Daniel jerks
   around to look at Teal'c when the Jaffa ready to fire. He and Teal'c
   quietly begin to reach for their weapons.]

     WOMAN

     (to Trelak)(defiant)
     Kill me if you want, but know this in the end. You and your people
     will be defeated just as the prophecy has foretold.

     TRELAK
     "The prophecy."

     MAYBOURNE

     (false laughter)
     Pay no attention. She's obviously frightened beyond reason.

     WOMAN

     (to Trelak)
     It foretold of your arrival and of your defeat.

     MAYBOURNE
     Another predicted rain today with a chance of morning frost, and
     yet, what fine weather we are enjoying.

     TRELAK

     Silence.
     (to the woman, reasonable)
     Where may I find this prophecy? If what you say is true, then we
     would be fools to stay and meet our certain death.

     WOMAN
     It is written on the walls of the old temple.

     TRELAK

     (to his Jaffa)
     Go with her.

   [Daniel is very unhappy at this unfortunate revelation of the existence
   of the Ancient ruins. It will only increase Lord Ares' interest in the
   planet and of course increase the danger to SG-1 and the villagers. As
   the woman is led away, Trelak and his Jaffa surround Maybourne.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [Carter is working feverishly at the time device, cables everywhere and
   her laptop powered up.]

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     Sam? Jack? This is Daniel. Ares' First Prime just sent some men out
     to check out the ruins. As soon as they see that Ancient writing,
     they're gonna search the area.

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Carter? How's it going in there?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Just a few more minutes, Sir.

     DANIEL

     (over radio)
     What are you guys doing? I thought you were going to blow it up?

     CARTER
     General O'Neill's given me one more chance to get the engines online
     so we can fly it out of here.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I'm all for saving the ship but you're cutting it kinda close.

     CARTER
     I know!

   [Carter cuts off communications and again bends over the time device,
   adjusting the cables covering its surface.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [Several of Maybourne's adoring acolytes are loading the table with the
   best food they have to offer. Some of the village elders sit silently
   at the table, watching every move the Jaffa make. Maybourne anxiously
   shoos the women, then calls out to Trelak.]

     MAYBOURNE
     I have prepared a feast in your honour. Come!

   [Trelak's unpleasant smile makes a reappearance.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Please, sit, partake of our bounty. This fruit, for instance -- it's
     sort of a cross between a...

   [Trelak takes Maybournes fist in his and crushes it. Maybourne breaks
   off his speech in a gasp of pain. The soft flesh of the fruit is
   squeezed between his fingers.]

     TRELAK

     (threatening)
     I'm not interested in your offering. You were warned. Anyone who
     refuses to accept us will die.

     MAYBOURNE
     You've made yourself perfectly clear.

     TRELAK
     To you, perhaps. But your subjects seem less than willing to accept
     our terms.

   [The village elders look stonily at Trelak, not giving an inch. Nearby,
   Daniel and Teal'c continue to keep watch.]

     TRELAK
     They cling to archaic beliefs -- prophecies, portents -- that
     threaten to undermine the rule of our god.

     MAYBOURNE

     That won't happen.
     (shifty, leading Trelak away for privacy)
     I can see to it.

     TRELAK
     How?

     MAYBOURNE
     They're simple folk, easily influenced. With my help, you'll have no
     trouble bending them to your will.

   EXT--ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS, DAY

   [The Jaffa guards lead the woman into the clearing where the Ancient
   temple ruins lie scattered. She takes them right to the column Daniel
   was so engrossed by earlier, the one that chronicled events from the
   future.]

     WOMAN
     It's here.

   [One Jaffa steps up to it and closely inspects the panel. He frowns in
   recognition that the text covering the column is important. O'Neill is
   watching this through a scope. The Jaffa immediately divides the patrol
   into a search party and sends them off into the trees.]

     O'NEILL
     Dammit!

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [Carter is working at her laptop.]

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Carter?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Sir?

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

     O'NEILL
     They're headed our way.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

     CARTER
     I need more time.

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

     O'NEILL

     (to himself)
     Yeah, of course you do!

   [O'Neill takes off after the departing Jaffa while Carter continues to
   try to fix the ship.]

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

   [Two Jaffa enter the clearing where the Ancient ship is hidden. O'Neill
   ambushes them from the undergrowth, killing them both with a burst of
   rapid fire.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [With Maybourne, Trelak freezes as O'Neill's P-90 is clearly heard. The
   Jaffa react defensively, aiming their staff weapons at the villagers,
   who freeze in fear. Trelak begins to look around him suspiciously as
   Daniel winds up with a Jaffa staff weapon at his back.]

     TRELAK
     Those were Tau'ri weapons.

     MAYBOURNE
     What's a Tau'ri?

   [At Trelak's signal, Jaffa begin to search the gathered crowd, pulling
   at cloaks, coats, concealing hats and hoods. Daniel and Teal'c are
   unmasked and disarmed within moments.]

   EXT--ALIEN WOODLAND, DAY

   [O'Neill runs towards the hatch of the Ancient ship as two more Jaffa
   burst into the clearing and immediately fire on him.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [Ignoring the firefight, Carter is still working desperately on the
   ship. O'Neill activates the hatch, closing it behind him.]

     O'NEILL
     Time's up.

   [The Jaffa begin to blast the rear hatch.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [Daniel and Teal'c are forced forward by their guards to face the First
   Prime.]

     TRELAK
     You're too late to save this world. I've already received word. Lord
     Ares has just arrived.

   [Daniel and Teal'c react bitterly to their captivity and to the news.
   In space above the planet, a Goa'uld mothership is approaching]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

     CARTER

     (slamming shut her laptop and unplugging it)
     I'm done! I think!
     (dashes forward to join O'Neill in the darkened cockpit)
     We're good to go, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     I'm doing the best I can.

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     TRELAK
     What were you and your allies planning?

   [Determined, Daniel and Teal'c won't answer.]

     TRELAK

     (walks up to be face to face with Teal'c)
     Know this, shol'va. I'll see to it that you suffer slowly.

     TEAL'C
     And I will see to it that you die quickly.

   [Trelak snorts derisively, takes up a staff weapon, then drives it
   viciously into Teal'c's midriff. Teal'c doubles over, slowly
   straightens up, and is struck from behind by a second Jaffa. He's
   knocked to his knees. Maybourne winces, and Daniel glares furiously at
   Trelak. Teal'c slowly, proudly rises to his feet again.]

     TRELAK
     I think not. My men guard the Gate, and the mothership descends as
     we speak.

   [Trelak chuckles triumphantly as he walks away. Teal'c glowers, while
   Daniel steals a silent, concerned look at him.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, DAY

   [In the darkened, silent ship, Carter looks around anxiously as the
   Jaffa blast away at the ship's hatch. O'Neill's eyes are closed and he
   is deep in concentration. Suddenly, the panels in the cockpit and on
   the flight console begin to light up. O'Neill's presses his hands
   harder against the flight controls and then opens his eyes in seeming
   surprise as the engine hum begins to steady and increase. He carefully
   moves his hands away as the power levels surge and the ship comes alive
   around him. The engine vibrations begin to shake loose the thick
   covering of vegetation from the hull of the Ancient ship and suddenly,
   it is taking off. The ship is clear.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

     TRELAK

     (with loathing)
     You were plotting in concert with the people of this world.
     Treachery is something we cannot abide.

     MAYBOURNE

     (looking disgustedly at Teal'c)
     I couldn't agree with you more.
     (strides over to Trelak, still trying to scam him)(mock outrage)
     You think you feel outraged? Imagine how I feel -- betrayed by my
     own people!

   [Trelak seizes Maybourne by the throat and begins to strangle him.
   Maybourne dangles helplessly from his grip, fighting for breath.
   Suddenly, they hear the sound of engines and Trelak looks up. Daniel
   and Teal'c look up in time to see the Ancient ship fly over the
   village. Its engines are so powerful, they shake the ground. Daniel and
   Teal'c instantly attack. Daniel knocks out his guard with the aid of a
   water bucket while Teal'c uses a staff weapon as a club. Daniel zats a
   Jaffa.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, UPPER ATMOSPHERE

     CARTER

     (checking readings)
     Sir, we're detecting another ship. It's big.

   [Carter and O'Neill look out in concern as the Ancient ship soars clear
   of the upper atmosphere and into space.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY

   [Daniel zats a Jaffa stationed on the upper level of the village and he
   topples over and plummets down to the ground. Then Daniel is struck in
   the stomach by a staff weapon as another Jaffa attacks him. Teal'c
   floors one guard, then turns swiftly to fire his staff weapon as
   another begins to charge down the stairs. Trelak drops Maybourne and
   rushes forward to jump Teal'c from behind. He attempts to choke Teal'c,
   who tried to throw him off. Maybourne comes to and sits up, clutching
   his throat. Teal'c throws Trelak over his head, smashing him into the
   ground. Daniel is forced back against the table, a staff weapon across
   his throat. He's choking. Trelak throws a stone at Teal'c's eye, buying
   enough time to snatch up a small wooden bench nearby. He breaks the
   bench over Teal'c's stooped back and as Teal'c falls, kicks him
   savagely in the ribs. The kick is hard enough to lift Teal'c and throw
   him onto his side. Trelak draws his blade.]

     TRELAK

     (savage hiss)
     Shol'va!

   [Maybourne creeps up behind Trelak and breaks pottery over his head. A
   moment later, Maybourne lands heavily on his back, some distance away.
   Teal'c blocks Trelak's arm as he strikes with his blade and the two
   freeze, glowering at one another hatefully. Trelak's hand shakes as he
   tries to break Teal'c's hold on him. Maybourne jumps up holding a pipe,
   but he hesitates as Trelak takes a two-handed grip on his blade and
   Teal'c is forced to match him. The two struggle desperately, in
   silence. Meanwhile Daniel is losing his own fight. Suddenly, the Jaffa
   warrior pinning Daniel cries out and falls forward, an arrow in his
   back. It was fired by Garan. Daniel pushes the dead Jaffa clear as
   Garan calmly reloads. Teal'c shakes as he and Trelak force the blade
   down between their bodies. He is clenching his teeth against the strain
   of forcing the blade towards Trelak. The First Prime's face begins to
   change as Teal'c makes a huge effort and drives the blade into him.]

     TRELAK
     You are a man of your word.

     TEAL'C

     (vengeful)(drives the blade deeper)
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c walks contemptuously away as Trelak falls to his knees, then
   pitches forward onto his face to lie dead in the dirt. Maybourne heaves
   a sigh of relief and puts down the pipe he hadn't used.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP, SPACE

     CARTER

     (reassuring)
     You're doing great, Sir.

   [The Ancient ship is rocked by weapons fire.]

     CARTER
     Relatively speaking.

   [O'Neill shoots her the kind of pissed look he usually shoots Daniel
   when he gets snarky. The Ancient ship flies away from the planet into
   the path of the weapons fire coming from Ares' mothership.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the ship)
     Weapons.
     (closes his eyes, concentrates fiercely)
     Weapons.

   [The Ancient ship suddenly fires a salvo as they close in on the
   mothership. There is a small explosion visible on the Goa'uld ship.]

     CARTER
     Keep firing, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Nothing's happening.

     CARTER
     Weapons must be depleted. Hopefully you hit some vital systems.

   [As they look anxiously at the mothership, fireballs begin to erupt
   from several openings within its hull. Then the ship is ripped by a
   massive explosion. O'Neill pulls up and dodges as Carter winces at the
   blinding light. Carter smiles in relief.]

     O'NEILL
     Think that was vital?

     CARTER

     (teasing)
     Relatively speaking.

   [O'Neill looks modest.]

   EXT--ALIEN STARGATE, DAY

   [Maybourne stands with Carter and O'Neill. Carter is smiling, watching
   O'Neill sniffing a bunch of yellow wild flowers he's been
   given.</blockquote>

     O'NEILL

     (to Maybourne)
     You sure you don't wanna leave all this?

     MAYBOURNE
     I can't abandon these people, Jack. I've made a life here. I can't
     walk away from my home, my friends.

   [O'Neill and Carter look around at the waiting people, smilingly.]

     MAYBOURNE
     My wives.

   [Carter and O'Neill's smiles are abruptly cut off.]

     CARTER

     (enunciating, disapproving)
     Wives?!
     (looks around at the several pretty young women)

     O'NEILL

     (pats Carter soothingly on the shoulder)
     Go.

   [Carter stalks past, glaring at Maybourne, who looks smug and amused.]

     O'NEILL

     (puts a hand on Maybourne's shoulder)(mild)
     Wives?

   [Maybourne shrugs deprecatingly and O'Neill reluctantly smiles before
   heading off.]

     O'NEILL

     (growling, envious) Dog!
     [Smiling, Maybourne turns to watch as Carter and O'Neill join Daniel
     and Teal'c on the Stargate dais. All bearing a posy of flowers, they
     walk through the Stargate. O'Neill hesitates. Maybourne, surrounded
     by his loving wives and subjects, smiling widely, salutes him. It's
     good to be king. O'Neill salutes back with his posy of flowers, then
     follows SG-1 home.

   [The Stargate shuts down.]

   FADE OUT
