   TEASER

   EXT--P3X-403--SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [SGC personnel are at work surveying a site. Maj. Lorne walks from the
   entrance to a mine through the busy camp to the Command Post where he
   finds his C.O., Colonel Edwards, grimacing over a geological map and
   cup of coffee. The C.P. has lighting, computers, and neat shelving
   units stacked high with maps. More maps are scattered over the surface
   of a table.]

     EDWARDS
     God. Three months on this rock and I still can't get a decent cup of
     coffee.

     LORNE
     Core sample analysis still coming in, but so far? Highest
     concentration is 2.3 parts per million.

     EDWARDS
     2.3 parts? Major Lorne, we need enough naquadah to manufacture 303s.
     You know how big a battle cruiser is?

     LORNE
     It's pretty big, Sir.

     EDWARDS
     If we start mining these deposits right now, today, your
     great-grandchildren are still gonna be trying to pull out enough ore
     just to make one.

   [Excitedly, Lt. Menard comes up to the table to make his report to
   Edwards.]

     MENARD
     Colonel Edwards?

   [Menard salutes.]

     EDWARDS
     Menard.

   [Edwards acknowledges by lifting his cup.]

     MENARD
     You're gonna want to see this, Sir. Latest sample analysis shows a
     concentration fifty times higher than anything we've seen so far
     and--and it's increasing as we go deeper. This could be the one,
     Sir.

   [Edwards looks at the results.]

     EDWARDS
     Yeah. If this pans out, your great-grandchildren might just be off
     the hook.

     LORNE
     Yes, Sir.

   [Edwards smiles.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST GEOLOGICAL SURVEY LOCATION, DAY

   [Lt. Ritter writes down some readings. Survey equipment is set up
   around him.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, UNAS POV, DAY

   [The scene is viewed from the point of view of an unknown Unas.
   Everything is a greenish tinge.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST GEOLOGICAL SURVEY LOCATION, DAY

   [Lt. Ritter takes readings with his theodolite. He hears a twig snap
   and looks up and around, concerned.]

   EXT--UNAS POV

   [The Unas watches Ritter as he moves over to the theodolite once more.]

   EXT--FOREST

   [Ritter is once more engrossed taking readings. A low growl is heard.]

   EXT--UNAS POV

   [Snarling, the Unas charges from the trees, swiping at Ritter and
   knocking him to the ground. Ritter cries out in shock.]

   EXT--FOREST

   [Screaming and clawing helplessly at the ground, Ritter is dragged into
   the forest by the unseen Unas.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--P3X-403, SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [Menard approaches Edwards as he and Lorne brief O'Neill, Daniel, and
   Teal'c.]

     MENARD

     (salutes)
     Colonel Edwards?

   [Menard hands over a report to Edwards. O'Neill is checking his
   sunglasses.]

     EDWARDS
     I'm glad you're here, Jack. We're not trained for search and rescue.
     And Ritter's been missing now for three hours.

     O'NEILL
     I assume he's got a compass and a radio?

     LORNE
     The planet has peculiar electromagnetic properties which make a
     compass useless and severely limit the range of our radios.

     EDWARDS
     He's a good man, and we need him back. Especially now we think we
     may have discovered a significant deposit of naquadah.

     TEAL'C
     How significant?

     LORNE
     Well, we won't know that until we complete our analysis.

     EDWARDS
     The Pentagon wants battle cruisers and F-302s. We find the rocks.

     O'NEILL

     And we find the rock
     (he pauses)
     finders.

   [Daniel turns to look at Jack questioningly. Jack turns to him, pulling
   a deprecating face.]

     EDWARDS
     There you have it. Um, Major Lorne will show you where Ritter was
     last seen.

     LORNE

     Yes, Sir.
     (to O'Neill)
     If you'll follow me?

   [Lorne leads O'Neill, Teal'c and the other men away, but Daniel's eye
   is caught by some objects protruding from beneath a tarpaulin which
   covers a crate.]

     DANIEL
     What's this?

   [Daniel pulls back the tarpaulin. Lorne walks back towards him. Daniel
   is clearly annoyed. In the background, O'Neill and Teal'c watch
   Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (upset)
     Artefacts?

   [O'Neill immediately walks over to Daniel.]

     LORNE
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     You found all this and you, you didn't contact me?

     LORNE
     We were going to.

     DANIEL
     They've been moved.

     LORNE
     Well, they were in the way.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

   [He steps forward, placing a reassuring hand on Daniel's shoulder.]

     O'NEILL
     Go to your happy place.

   [Daniel still looks very annoyed. O'Neill pats his shoulder and shoots
   a warning glance at Lorne.]

     O'NEILL
     Go!

   [O'Neill walks away from Daniel, indicating with his hand for Daniel to
   stay and follows Lorne and the others out of the camp, glancing back to
   check on Daniel as he goes.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST--GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, DAY

   [Lorne is looking through the scope of the theodolite where we last saw
   Lt. Ritter.]

     LORNE
     Lt. Ritter was recording elevations and mapping the surrounding
     area. When he didn't show up for chow, we got worried and went out
     looking for him, Sir. Uh, sent up a couple of flares, hoped he'd see
     'em, get his bearings.

     O'NEILL
     Is it normal for guys to wander away from camp?

     LORNE
     Well, he might have been placing markers. You know, multiple
     sightings, some up to half a mile. You get turned around.

   [Teal'c emerges from the tree line and joins O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     The ground is extremely firm, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     No tracks?

     TEAL'C
     Not in the immediate area. However, there is considerable damage to
     the underbrush moving off in several different directions.

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     Jack, come in?

     O'NEILL

     (into his radio)
     Yeah. Go ahead.

     DANIEL

     (static)
     I've got something you should see

   [The transmission is garbled, fading in and out.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm not reading you. Say again?

     DANIEL
     I said, I've got something here you need to see.

     O'NEILL

     Alright. On my way.
     (to the men)
     You guys keep looking. I'll be back.

   [Teal'c bows his head in acknowledgement.]

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [O'Neill approaches Daniel, who is inspecting a piece of rusted mining
   equipment.]

     O'NEILL
     Whaddaya got?

     DANIEL

     Well, mostly mining equipment. Could be several hundred years old.
     Hard to date it 'til I get back to the SGC.
     (he holds up a torture stick)
     Remember these?

     O'NEILL
     Ever so fondly.

   [Daniel touches it to the crate, and it emits an electrical charge.]

     DANIEL
     Still has power.

     O'NEILL

     (ironically)
     Just keeps going and going.

     DANIEL
     I want to show you the truly fascinating part.

   [He slides his hands across the length of a large yoke on top of the
   crate.]

     DANIEL
     It's a yoke. Capable of supporting or pulling great weight. Evenly
     distributes the weight across the shoulders. It predates the harness
     on Earth.

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     Fascinating. Truly.

     DANIEL
     Well, I was getting to the truly fascinating part. It's, it's too
     big. Too heavy.

     O'NEILL
     Meaning?

     DANIEL
     Meaning it wasn't made for a human being.

     O'NEILL
     Who was it made for?

     DANIEL
     Well, it's too small for a four-legged animal. If I had to make a
     guess, based on what I know about the Goa'uld, I'd say it was made
     for an Unas.

     O'NEILL

     (heart-felt groan)
     Oh.

     DANIEL
     Now, we know the Goa'uld used the Unas as slaves long before humans.
     They're predominately cave dwellers, incredibly strong and capable
     of working in harsh environments. Perfect labour for this kind of
     mining.

     O'NEILL

     This day just gets better and better.
     (into his radio)
     Teal'c, come in?

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, DAY

     TEAL'C

     (into his radio)
     Proceed, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     (via radio)
     Find anything?

     TEAL'C
     We have not.

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Well, heads up. Daniel just found evidence an Unas might have been
     in the area.

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, DAY

     TEAL'C

     (looks around at Lorne and the men)
     Acknowledged.

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, MINE ENTRANCE, DAY

     EDWARDS
     Okay, let me get this straight. You want me to delay this operation
     because you found some shoulder harness?

   [Edwards emerges from the mine entrance, Daniel hard on his heels.]

     DANIEL
     Yoke, actually. It's...

     EDWARDS
     That could be could be a hundred years old, built for a creature
     that probably disappeared or died off a long time ago.

   [They reach a table laden with maps and reports. O'Neill is waiting for
   them there.]

     DANIEL
     It's not uncommon for Goa'uld to leave their slaves behind once
     they've lost interest in a planet.

     EDWARDS
     We've been here for three months. We haven't seen or heard anything
     like what you describe.

     DANIEL
     Maybe that's the way they want it?

     EDWARDS
     Look. Doctor, I've got the Pentagon breathing down my neck, I've
     gotta show some results.

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     Colonel, you don't understand. Unas are territorial, and when
     provoked, they can be extremely dangerous.

     EDWARDS

     (to O'Neill)
     Is he always like this?

     O'NEILL

     (matter-of-fact)
     Yeah, pretty much.

   [Daniel crosses his arms over his chest, frowning.]

     EDWARDS
     If these things really are here, do you think they had anything to
     do with, uh, Ritter going missing?

     DANIEL
     Yes, I do.

     EDWARDS
     Well, I'm not closing down this operation, that's for damn sure. But
     I do think we should bring in some extra troops, help secure the
     area.

   [Daniel is unhappy with this suggestion.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, UNAS FORBIDDEN GROUND, DAY

   [Teal'c and Lorne discover what is clearly forbidden ground, with the
   remains of dead Jaffa ceremonially displayed on scarecrow-like
   scaffolds, acting as totems, and Unas bone necklaces placed on a rock.
   Teal'c lifts one of the bone necklaces.]

     LORNE
     What is it?

     TEAL'C
     The Unas wear these to prevent the Goa'uld from burrowing into their
     necks.

   EXT--FOREST, UNAS FORBIDDEN GROUND, UNAS POV

     Kor Asek pulls a branch away to see Lorne approach a mine entrance
     as Teal'c and the others wander through the area.

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, REGULAR POV

   [Unseen by the others, Kor Asek's vantage point is concealed behind a
   tree. The Unas is mature, and its right eye is scarred through.]

   [Lorne moves away from a mine entrance. He begins to look around,
   fascinated by the decayed bodies and armour strung up on the
   scaffolds.]

     TEAL'C
     I believe these figures are intended as a warning to stay away.

   [Lorne walks on, turning at last to see a fresh corpse strung up like a
   scarecrow on one of the scaffolds. It is Lt. Ritter. Lorne goes over to
   him, utterly appalled. Teal'c joins him.]

     TEAL'C
     Lt. Ritter.

   [Nauseated, Lorne turns away and vomits.]

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [A body bag is zipped and stretchered away.]

     EDWARDS

     (briefing his men with O'Neill and Teal'c in attendance)
     Alright! I want extra ammo for everyone. Keep your eyes open, and
     stay in radio contact!

   [Daniel is standing to his rear, examining an aerial photograph
   displayed on a board.]

     DANIEL
     What are you intending to do?

   [Edwards walks towards Daniel. In the background, Jack follows.]

     EDWARDS
     These things killed one of my men and strung him up like a
     scarecrow. What the hell do you think I intend to do?

     DANIEL
     Well, you may have unknowingly provoked them.

     EDWARDS
     We didn't even know they were here. How the hell could we have
     provoked them?

     DANIEL

     (indicating the aerial photograph)
     If this mine extends as far as your estimates say, then this other
     entrance would be well within the tunnel network. It's an alternate
     entrance to the same mine. Now, it has to be something about this
     area, this mine. They don't want us here.

     EDWARDS
     The feeling's mutual.

     DANIEL
     Jack?

     O'NEILL

     (to Edwards)
     Look, I know he can be a little...
     (he pauses)
     But he's usually right about this stuff.

     EDWARDS
     My orders are to determine the potential of this site as a mining
     operation. Until those orders are rescinded, I'm gonna do whatever
     it takes to ensure the safety of my people. So, are you going to
     help me secure this area, or not?

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, DAY

   [SG-12, O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c move cautiously on a sweep of the
   forest.]

     DANIEL
     This is a mistake.

     O'NEILL
     It's his command, Daniel.

     DANIEL
     He's never encountered the Unas before. He doesn't know what he's
     dealing with.

   [Gunfire erupts. O'Neill and Daniel break into a run.]

   EXT--P3X-403 ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST, DAY

   [Unas are attacking SG-12, striking the men with clubs and claws,
   hurling them violently to the ground or slamming them into trees. There
   are roars of rage from the Unas and cries of fear and pain from the men
   of SG-12, peppered with sporadic gunfire. Some of the Unas are hit by
   the gunfire, falling with cries of pain.]

   [Lt. Menard turns in confusion and is struck down by Iron Shirt.]

     MENARD

     (screams)
     Aaarrrggghhh!

   [Iron Shirt, wearing Jaffa armour, growls at Menard, then turns as
   another Unas is killed. It sees O'Neill leading reinforcements and
   gunfire breaks out again. Iron Shirt slips behind a tree, clawing at
   O'Neill as he passes. O'Neill is lifted from his feet by the force of
   the blow and falls heavily to the ground. Iron Shirt charges, O'Neill
   rolling to meet it but failing to fire.]

     DANIEL

     (raising his Beretta to fire, then calling out urgently)
     Ka keka!

   [The Unas jerks around to look at Daniel, stunned by hearing its own
   language.]

     DANIEL
     Ka keka!

   [Iron Shirt turns back to O'Neill who raises his weapon but still
   doesn't fire. Iron Shirt looks again to Daniel.]

     IRON SHIRT
     Ska nat? Ka ko keka!

   [He looks back at O'Neill again, then yells at those who have
   accompanied him.]

     IRON SHIRT

     (roars out to the Unas)
     Benar! Benar ka cha! Benar ka cha!

   [The Unas break off their attack immediately, retrieving their wounded
   and dead and dragging them away into the forest. As one Unas is dragged
   away, his bone necklace is left unnoticed on the ground by a tree,
   spattered with green blood. Teal'c, Edwards, Lorne and more troops run
   in to assist. O'Neill grimaces with pain as Daniel rushes towards him.]

     O'NEILL

     (motioning to Menard)
     Help him! Help him!

   [Teal'c follows Daniel over to the stricken Menard, the two of them
   checking his wound as O'Neill struggles to his feet.]

     O'NEILL

     (sotto voce)
     God!

     EDWARDS

     (extremely aggressive)
     My men'll take care of the rest of the wounded. They're on the run.
     Let's take 'em now!

   [The Unas are heard roaring in anger and sorrow in the distance.]

     EDWARDS

     (agitated)
     What's that? What are they doing now?

     DANIEL
     They're mourning their dead.

     EDWARDS
     This may be our best chance. Come on, we're not just gonna let 'em
     get away, are we?

     O'NEILL
     We're not gonna pursue an enemy into unknown terrain!

     EDWARDS
     Jack, you make it sound like they're capable of tactics, here.

     DANIEL
     We've had dealing with them before. They're far more intelligent
     than you think.

     EDWARDS
     I don't care! They attacked us!

     O'NEILL
     Edwards! We're not goin' in.

     EDWARDS

     (pointing at Jack)
     This is my command! You are here at my request!

     DANIEL
     You're in charge of a mining operation.

     O'NEILL
     Your standing orders no longer apply! Now, let's take it back to
     SGC, and we'll figure it out there.

     EDWARDS
     Fine!

   [Daniel and O'Neill exchange a sober look.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [O'Neill sits on an infirmary bed . He wears a white hospital gown, his
   wounded shoulder in a sling. A nurse adjusts the shoulder strap of the
   sling as O'Neill cringes in pain.]

     O'NEILL

     (grumpily)
     Ow! God! Get away!

   [He pushes at the nurse. Carter approaches, passing Daniel who is by
   the bed.]

     CARTER

     (wincing)
     How's the arm?

     O'NEILL
     Good. How's the science project?

     CARTER

     (slightly annoyed)
     You mean my complete overhaul of the Gate diagnostic system?

     O'NEILL
     I guess that's what I mean.

     CARTER
     It's going well, Sir. Thank you for asking.

     DANIEL
     Uh, if we go back to this planet, you're not coming with us, are
     you?

     O'NEILL

     (looks down at his sling meaningfully)
     It's doubtful.

     DANIEL
     Yeah. That's too bad. I was kinda hoping you'd take command of the
     mission.

   [O'Neill looks at him questioningly.]

     DANIEL

     (to Carter)
     Colonel Edwards has no experience dealing with the Unas.

     O'NEILL
     Nor you.

   [Daniel shrugs mild acknowledgement.]

     O'NEILL
     He's an okay guy, Daniel. He's just under a lot of pressure.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, yeah. I, I guess I just spent a lot of time breaking you in. I
     just didn't want to have to start with a new colonel.

   [Carter tries unsuccessfully to hide a look of amusement.]

     O'NEILL

     (slightly sarcastic)
     It'll be fine.

   [Daniel nods, exchanging a quick smile with Carter before walking away.
   As Daniel reaches the doorway, O'Neill calls out to him.]

     O'NEILL

     Just try not to be...
     (he hesitates)
     sooo...

   [O'Neill grimaces.]

     DANIEL

     (looking back)
     What?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, you know.

   [O'Neill starts to lie down. Carter and Daniel both wear puzzled looks
   as Daniel exits the room. O'Neill groans and sighs as he lies down on
   his wounded shoulder.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Generals Hammond and Vidrine are briefing Col. Edwards.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, General Vidrine is down from the Pentagon. He's been put in
     charge of BC-303 production.

     VIDRINE
     We've read your report, Colonel, and we agree that the evacuation
     was warranted. Unfortunately, however, with the Prometheus stranded
     halfway across the galaxy, Earth is currently vulnerable to orbital
     attack. Now, if someone can show me another way to acquire naquadah,
     or can make a battle cruiser without it, I'm listening. Otherwise
     we've got to go back to P3X-403.

     EDWARDS
     With enough men and enough fire power, I can take care of your
     problem, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Well, that's one way to address the situation. But we've dealt with
     these creatures before, and I can guarantee you it isn't going to be
     as easy as you think it is.

     VIDRINE
     Well, be that as it may, the Pentagon's position is quite clear on
     this. Col. Edwards will return to the planet and begin mining
     operations immediately. SG personnel will provide security on a
     continuing basis. Now, if this leads to hostilities...

   [Daniel is hovering hesitantly in the doorway to the briefing room.]

     DANIEL
     It will.

     VIDRINE
     Dr. Jackson? I don't believe you were invited to this meeting.

     DANIEL
     Yes, General, I know. I'm sorry, but please, hear me out. I think
     the situation can be resolved peacefully.

   [Daniel walks over to Edwards, facing Vidrine and Hammond.]

     VIDRINE
     How?

     DANIEL
     Well, we've been on this planet a long time looking for the best
     mine site. It wasn't until we encroached on this one particular
     region that the Unas attacked. I mean, can't we just mine somewhere
     else? Away from this one area?

     EDWARDS
     All the other mine sites we've surveyed have been void of
     significant deposits. This is the only site we've found, thus far,
     that might satisfy production quotas.

     DANIEL
     And if this leads to another dead end?

     VIDRINE
     Then we won't have a problem. But I'm not going to walk away from
     this until I know for sure.

     DANIEL
     Well, then, can we at least try to negotiate with them?

     EDWARDS
     They're animals, Sir.

     DANIEL
     They are not animals. They are intelligent beings with a sense of
     honour, and if you underestimate them, more will die on both sides.

     VIDRINE
     Who would negotiate on our behalf? You?

     DANIEL
     I can speak their language with a limited vocabulary, and I have a
     rudimentary understanding of their ways, but this has gone too far
     for me to handle myself.

     VIDRINE
     What are you proposing, Doctor?

     DANIEL
     I suggest we use Chaka as a liaison.

     VIDRINE
     Chaka?

     DANIEL
     He's an Unas we met on a different planet. Now, I've had periodic
     contact with him. He's made impressive progress in his understanding
     of us. Look, we've interacted with these beings before and lived.
     Chaka himself saved my life. This is their planet. We're the
     invaders. We don't have to provoke them. We don't have to kill them.

     VIDRINE
     Well, I'm sure no one wants that, Dr. Jackson.

     DANIEL

     (glances at Edwards)
     Yes, I'm sure.

     HAMMOND

     (to Vidrine)
     If the negotiations are resolved in the time allotted to determine
     the viability of the mine, you're giving up nothing by letting him
     try.

     VIDRINE
     Alright. You may proceed.

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Jackson? You'll contact Chaka and return him here without delay.

     VIDRINE
     One more thing, so that there's no confusion. If negotiations fail,
     and it comes down to us or them? I choose us. The use of deadly
     force is authorized.

   [Edwards and Daniel acknowledge this grim pronouncement.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     IDC received, Sir. Dr. Jackson, plus one.

     HAMMOND

     (in the Gate room)
     Open the iris.

   [The iris opens and Daniel steps through with an Unas. It is Chaka,
   more mature than when last seen, dressed in formal tan coloured robes.]

     HAMMOND

     (turning to the defence team)
     Stand down.

   [Chaka looks around warily.]

     DANIEL
     Chaka's never been in a structure like this before.

   [He leads Chaka down the ramp. Chaka continues to look around him,
   growling a little.]

     VIDRINE
     Um.

   [Chaka spins to face him, snarling.]

     CHAKA
     A cha'ka.

     DANIEL
     Um, a cha'ka is a greeting. In this case, he's, uh, he's saying
     'hello'.

     CHAKA
     'Ell-o.

   [Edwards snorts, eying Chaka with hostility and disbelief.]

   [Chaka snorts in return, equally hostile.]

     DANIEL
     Um, I've had a chance to talk with Chaka. Over the past year, he's
     managed to accomplish some remarkable things. On the planet where
     Chaka now lives, humans used Unas as domesticated slaves. Chaka led
     an uprising, and...

     EDWARDS
     An uprising? You neglected to mention this before. How many people
     were killed in this uprising?

     DANIEL
     That's not the point. Chaka brokered a truce, and over time
     established a fragile, yet successful, peace between the humans and
     the Unas who were formerly their slaves. Now, if he could manage to
     do this, I know he could act as a peaceful liaison between ourselves
     and the Unas of P3X-403.

     HAMMOND
     Does he even want to help us?

     DANIEL

     I've informed him of what we need to do.
     (smiling)
     He's eager to meet Unas of other worlds.
     (to Chaka)
     Tar ma kan ko?

     CHAKA

     (grunting, he walks forward a little.)
     'Uman 'elp Chaka. Chaka 'elp 'Uman.

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [The camp is in ruins; crates and supplies are burning. Edwards surveys
   the damage, Daniel and Lorne either side of him.]

     LORNE
     Looks like the Unas had a little party while we were gone.

     EDWARDS
     You're right, Dr. Jackson. They're much more advanced than what I
     thought. They have command of fire. Major Lorne, as soon as this
     place is cleaned up, I want you to begin a resonance scan analysis
     of the lower mine shafts.

     LORNE
     Yes, Sir.

     EDWARDS

     (turning to Daniel)
     Exactly how do you intend to find these Unas, Doctor?

     DANIEL
     I think Chaka will lead us to them.

   [Edwards stares at Chaka, who is behind Daniel, looking around at the
   smouldering camp. Aware of the scrutiny, Chaka turns, snarling at
   Edwards, who is undeterred. Chaka moves towards him, bristling.]

     DANIEL
     Chaka.

   [Chaka stops, but he and Edwards are staring each other down. Daniel
   hastily steps in between the two and faces Edwards.]

     DANIEL

     Colonel, he knows you don't like him. If you keep staring at him
     like that, he's going to take it as a challenge.
     (turns to Chaka who is snarling)
     Chaka, ka keka.

   [Chaka looks at Daniel and Daniel nods. Chaka growls, but turns away.]

     EDWARDS

     Just keep him away from me.
     (turning)
     Hanson! Penhall! You're with them. The rest of you people! I want
     this perimeter secured. Antipersonnel and overlapping fields of
     fire! Move it!

     DANIEL

     (walking over to talk to Teal'c)
     He's getting ready for a war.

     TEAL'C
     He has a responsibility to protect this camp.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, or he's looking for revenge for Lt. Ritter.

   EXT--P3X-403, FOREST UNAS FORBIDDEN GROUND, DAY

   [Chaka leads Teal'c, Daniel, Hanson and Penhall to the first of the
   scarecrow scaffolds, exploring it with hands and sniffing.]

     CHAKA
     'Uman `tatak?

     DANIEL
     Ka. No. We're not going to attack.

     CHAKA
     Tonok shesh. 'Uman `tatak.

     DANIEL
     He says that our weapons and the size of our group are alarming,
     create fear. It, it seems like we intend to attack.

     CHAKA
     Ka, Dan'al. Chaka ka cha.

     DANIEL
     He wants me to go with him alone.

     CHAKA
     Ka keka.

     DANIEL
     Unarmed.

   [He diasarms.]

     TEAL'C
     You will be completely helpless.

     DANIEL

     (handing his Beretta to Teal'c)
     I'll be alright.

     TEAL'C

     (earnest)
     This is unwise, DanielJackson.

     DANIEL
     Look, we can't make contact with them if they think we're going to
     attack.

     TEAL'C
     Are you certain?

     DANIEL

     (sounding uncertain)
     Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm certain.

   [Teal'c reluctantly takes the Beretta, watching as Chaka leads Daniel
   away.]

   EXT--P3X-403 UNAS ALTAR, DAY

   [Chaka leads Daniel into a rock-strewn clearing in the forest, bordered
   by more of the scarecrow scaffolds with their rotting Jaffa corpses and
   a ceremonial altar, a stone circle before it on the ground. Chaka sits
   by the stone ring, set for a fire, while Daniel is drawn to the altar.]

     DANIEL

     Staff weapons, torture sticks, manacles. Symbols of pain and death.
     (he notices Chaka by the firewood)
     Chaka? Here. I've got a new toy.

   [Daniel bends down to light the fire with his lighter.]

     CHAKA
     Aka.

     DANIEL
     You're welcome.

   [Daniel puts the lighter back in his vest.]

     CHAKA

     (chanting)
     A cha'ka, a cha'ka, a cha'ka

     DANIEL
     'Come sit by my fire.' Unas diplomacy.

     CHAKA

     (continues chanting)
     A cha'ka, a cha'ka, a cha'ka

     DANIEL

     (Clears his throat)
     Chaka? How long is this, um?

   [Annoyed, Chaka breaks off his chant.]

     DANIEL
     Kel nok ma kan ska nat?

     CHAKA
     Nok.

   [Chaka gestures skyward.]

     DANIEL
     Now?

     CHAKA
     Ka nok.

   [He jerks his arm forward and gestures sharply again.]

     DANIEL
     Later?

     CHAKA

     (begins chanting again)
     A cha'ka, a cha'ka, a cha'ka.

     DANIEL
     It will take as long as it takes. Okay.

     He sits cross-legged at Chaka's side, settling in for a long wait.

   EXT--P3X-403 UNAS ALTAR, NIGHT

   [Chaka is still chanting while Daniel lies stretched out by the fire,
   idly tossing twigs into the flames, visibly bored.]

     CHAKA

     (chanting)
     A cha'ka, a cha'ka, a cha'ka.

   UNAS POV

   [Iron Shirt watches Daniel and Chaka at the campfire and growls.]

   REGULAR POV

   [Chaka looks up, growling, sensing a presence. He snarls, and Iron
   Shirt, the Alpha Male of the P3X-403 Unas approaches from the tree
   line. His clan has surrounded the clearing. Daniel glances up and gets
   very still.]

     DANIEL
     Helloooo.

   [Iron Shirt closes in on Daniel and Chaka, accompanied by his clan.
   They are hostile, snarling and making aggressive darts forward as Iron
   Shirt walks closer. Daniel and Chaka get to their feet to face him.
   Iron Shirt launches several feinting charges towards Daniel and Chaka,
   clearly attempting to intimidate them and building up to a real attack
   by the clan.]

     DANIEL
     I hope you know what you're doing!

   [Chaka kneels, Daniel immediately following as the anger of the Unas
   escalates.]

     DANIEL
     Down? Good idea!

   [Iron Shirt recognises this gesture of submissiveness, and his clan is
   silenced. Chaka glances up, snorting, then bows again. Iron Shirt moves
   in to join them. Chaka pulls out a Goa'uld knife and lays it on a rock
   by the fire as an offering. Iron Shirt accepts the gift, displaying it
   to his clan. He then pulls off a leather wristband and offers it to
   Chaka.]

     DANIEL

     (watching the action)
     Trade?

   [Chaka glances to Daniel then picks up the wristband. The clan react
   angrily, hissing and snarling, and Iron Shirt silences them sharply
   with an authoritative bark.]

     IRON SHIRT
     Aka.

     CHAKA
     A cha'ka. Te Chaka.

     IRON SHIRT

     Ta?

     DANIEL
     Um, a cha'ka. Te Daniel.

     IRON SHIRT

     DANIEL
     Dan'al's fine.

     IRON SHIRT
     Te Kor Asek zo!

   [Kor Asek grunts rhythmically.]

     DANIEL
     Kor is iron? Asek?

   [Chaka quickly gestures towards his arm and torso in explanation.]

     DANIEL
     Iron Shirt? The alpha male.

     IRON SHIRT
     Kel ko tar?

     CHAKA

     Tar 'uman.
     (referring to Daniel)
     'Uman ka nay.

     IRON SHIRT
     Kel ko keka?

     DANIEL
     Uh, yes, we brought death, but, but we wanna be friends. Uh, to
     preserve life. Ska nat!

     CHAKA
     Ska nat. Unas, Kor Asek, a Chaka, a 'Uman. Ska nat te.

     DANIEL
     That's right. We work this out we, we all win.

   [Iron Shirt communicates with his restless clan.]

     IRON SHIRT
     Cho'ee'che, Chaka.

   [Chaka shifts to a sitting position.]

     IRON SHIRT
     Dan'al.

   [Daniel sits also. Chaka looks at Daniel and gestures for Daniel to
   invite Iron Shirt to sit.]

     DANIEL
     Cho'ee'che, Kor Asek.

   [Iron Shirt lowers himself onto his haunches, snarling as he does so.]

     DANIEL

     (quietly, to himself)
     Okay. Alright. Now we're talking, huh?

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [Daniel and Chaka stride energetically into the camp to find Teal'c
   with Lorne.]

     LORNE
     Dr. Jackson? How'd it go?

     DANIEL

     Well, I figured out why they attacked us. It's this mine!
     (he gestures)
     It's sacred to them.

   [He walks straight through Teal'c and Lorne who turn to follow him and
   Chaka over to the C.P. and Col. Edwards.]

     DANIEL
     Most of their ancestors were worked to death by the Goa'uld while
     they were mining it. They're scarred. It's a wonder they didn't
     attack us the minute we set foot on this planet.

     LORNE
     Doctor, look.

     DANIEL
     Now, I told them I'd speak to my superiors on their behalf. Sacred
     burial grounds are protected on Earth from industrial development. I
     think the same rule should apply here. We have to leave.

     LORNE
     We got the results of the resonance scan. The deposit is over 300
     meters in length and almost completely solid.

   [He shows Daniel the scan on the laptop. Edwards walks over to join
   them.]

     EDWARDS
     53,000 metric tonnes. We're not going anywhere.

   [Daniel contemplates this news.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond and Vidrine are listening to a broadcast from P3X-403. Daniel
   stoops in front of the MALP camera, Chaka visible behind him.]

     DANIEL
     My meeting with the Unas went well, Sir. Uh, they're reluctant to
     trust us, but I did manage to open up a line of communication.

     VIDRINE
     How many of them are there?

     DANIEL
     I only saw a medium-sized clan. I can't be sure. Why?

     VIDRINE
     We need to know if we're going to relocate them.

     DANIEL
     They'll never accept relocation, Sir. They won't understand it.

     VIDRINE
     Then it's your job to make them understand. If you don't, we'll have
     to go in there with tranquillisers and capture them.

     DANIEL

     (muttering to himself)
     They're not animals.
     (louder)
     Look, I'm pretty sure Chaka and I can accomplish something. Just let
     me go talk to them again.

     HAMMOND
     You have twenty-four hours to convince the Unas to come peacefully,
     or they'll be forcibly removed.

   [Daniel nods in acknowledgement, but still looks upset. He abruptly
   switches off the camera. The monitor reads 'Transmission Terminated'.
   Hammond and Vidrine look at one another soberly.]

   EXT--P3X-403 UNAS ALTAR, DAY

   [Daniel and Chaka are again negotiating with Iron Shirt.]

     IRON SHIRT
     'Uman ko keka onac. Unas ko keka onac.

     DANIEL
     That's right, that's right. We should not be fighting with each
     other. The, the Goa'uld are a common enemy.

     CHAKA
     Ka nay.

     DANIEL
     Ka nay. Friend, uh, clan member.

   [Daniel gestures by clasping his hands together.]

     IRON SHIRT
     'Uman ka nay.

   [He mimics Daniel's gesture.]

   [Chaka nods.]

     DANIEL
     That's right. That's right. So...

   [He opens a pocket on his vest and pulls out an energy bar.]

     DANIEL
     We're going to give you food.

   [He takes a small bite out of the energy bar.]

     DANIEL
     'Uman ko nan Unas.

   [He hands the bar to Chaka, who passes it to Iron Shirt. Iron Shirt
   sniffs it cautiously. Chaka nods approvingly. Iron Shirt tastes the
   bar. Iron Shirt purrs in pleasure.]

     DANIEL
     And in exchange we need this.

   [He holds up a naquadah rock.]

     IRON SHIRT
     Kada.

     DANIEL
     Kada yes, we need kada to make war with the Goa'uld.

     CHAKA
     'Uman ko kada. Tonok tok onac.

     IRON SHIRT
     Kel?

     DANIEL

     How? Well, we make, uh ships out of it.
     (Chaka and Iron Shirt are uncomprehending)
     Um.

   [Daniel does an aeroplane impression, complete with zoomie noises. The
   Unas grunt in annoyance. Chaka growls, shaking his head. Iron Shirt
   snarls.]

     DANIEL
     Right. Why would either of you know what a ship was?

   [He looks around and gets up to go to the altar.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, this.

   [He picks up a staff weapon.]

     DANIEL
     You know what this is?

     IRON SHIRT
     Kekata.

     DANIEL
     Kekata, yes. Uh, we can make kekata with this. Kada.

   [He taps the rock against the shaft of the staff weapon.]

     DANIEL
     Now, with many kekata...

   [He gestures at the collection on the altar.]

     DANIEL
     We can bring death to the Goa'uld.

   [He taps a Serpent Guard helmet.]

     DANIEL
     The Onac.

     relocate you. Uh?
     (He wiggles his fingers like feet walking and moves his hand from
     one place to another.)
     Relocate.
     (to Chaka)
     Ta 'relocate'?

     CHAKA
     Shesh.

     DANIEL
     Uh.

   [Daniel picks up some wood and shows it to Chaka in one place, on the
   left side of his body. Then he moves the wood to a place on the right
   side of his body and drops it.]

     CHAKA
     Ta ko ka cha.

     DANIEL
     Ko ka cha. 'Uman ko ka cha Unas ko no na. Away from your home.

   watch them go.]

   EXT--P3X-403 FOREST, DAY

   [Woeste is signalling to his men as Daniel and Chaka run through the
   Unas forbidden ground. Woeste is scanning the trees urgently, watched
   by an Unas.]

   UNAS POV

   [An Unas sees Woeste aiming his weapon into the woods, but that Woeste
   does not see him. At the base of a tree nearby, the Unas spots his bone
   necklace. It's the same necklace which fell during the earlier battle.]

   REGULAR POV

   [The Unas charges out to reclaim its bone necklace and Woeste turns,
   gunning it down. It roars out in pain as it falls.]

   [Daniel and Chaka react to the burst of gunfire, then rush up to Woeste
   at the same time as Edwards. Woeste is standing over the fallen Unas.]

     DANIEL

     (despairing)
     Oh, God.

     EDWARDS
     What happened? What happened?

     LT. WOESTE
     It was coming up on my position. It was attacking.

     DANIEL
     It was attacking?

   [He looks around at the area and spots the bone necklace at the base of
   the tree.]

     DANIEL

     The necklace.
     (He goes over and picks up the bone necklace.)
     This bone necklace was precious to him. He was coming back for it,
     and we killed him.

     LT. WOESTE
     I didn't know

     EDWARDS
     No need to apologize

   [Many Unas voices roar in rage, unseen among the trees.]

     CHAKA
     Ka tok!

     TEAL'C
     They are preparing to attack.

     EDWARDS
     Let 'em come. We're ready.

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, DAY

   [Trailed by Teal'c, Chaka and the men, Daniel and Edwards stride
   through the camp. The air is overwhelmed with a menacing roar from the
   unseen Unas.]

     DANIEL
     Colonel, we have to get out of here right now.

     EDWARDS
     I don't buy it.

     DANIEL
     Are you hearing this?

     EDWARDS
     A population that large would have been seen by aerial scans.

     DANIEL
     Unas live primarily underground in caves where aerial scans don't
     detect them.

     TEAL'C
     Our position will be overrun.

     DANIEL
     I was this close to working out an agreement with them. They just
     want to be left alone.

   EXT--P3X-403, RIDGE ABOVE CAMP, DAY

   [Iron Shirt stands looking down into the camp, watching Daniel and
   Edwards argue. He snarls.]

   EXT--P3X-403, SURVEY CAMP, DAY

     CHAKA

     (reacts instantly to Iron Shirt's presence)
     Dan'al!

   [Chaka and Daniel turn to stare at Iron Shirt on the ridge above. He
   snarls again and behind him a thundering sound is heard. The SG teams
   take up defensive positions in the camp.]

     DANIEL
     Hold your fire!

     EDWARDS
     If they attack, we will defend ourselves!

   [Iron Shirt is joined on the ridge by a horde of maddened Unas, lining
   up beside him, bellowing their fury at the men below. Daniel, Edwards
   and the others' eyes track along the ridge as the Unas pour out of the
   trees in unbelievable numbers. Their force is immense, stretching out
   the entire length of the ridge. The SG group realize they are
   hopelessly outnumbered.]

   [Iron Shirt bellows out above the horde, silencing them instantly.]

     EDWARDS
     You're right, Dr. Jackson. Let's get back to the Gate.

     DANIEL
     No, it's too late. If we move now, they'll run us down.

   [Snarling, Iron Shirt takes a leap. Then he begins walking down from
   the ridge into the camp, alone.]

     EDWARDS
     What's he doing?

     DANIEL
     I don't know.

   [Lorne and the other soldiers are increasingly edgy and nervous as Iron
   Shirt draws closer.]

     DANIEL
     Don't do anything stupid. He's giving us a chance.

     EDWARDS
     A chance to do what?

   [Iron Shirt walks over to Daniel, growling at him.]

     DANIEL
     To surrender.

     EDWARDS
     Surrender? Not possible.

   [He keeps his weapon aimed at Iron Shirt.]

     DANIEL
     Don't do it, Colonel.

   [Edwards slowly lowers his weapon. Daniel takes a step forward.]

     DANIEL

     EDWARDS
     What are you saying?

     DANIEL

     I'm saying we don't have to kill each other.

     'Uman a ta a ka naya. We can be of the same tribe. A ka naya keka
     Onac. Together we can bring death to the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     Trick?

     IRON SHIRT
     Dan'al, cho'ee'che. 'Uman ko keka Unas.

     DANIEL
     He's saying that while we talk peace, humans kill Unas. He doesn't
     believe me. We have to show respect. We have to get down on the
     ground.

   [Chaka is already starting to kneel.]

     EDWARDS
     On the ground? There's no way I'm gettin' down on the...

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     Colonel, this is the way their social order works! We have to show
     submissiveness to show that we're not a threat, that we're not
     challenging them! We have to get down on the ground and that is all
     that we have to do.

   [Daniel, Chaka and Teal'c lower themselves to one knee. Iron Shirt
   looks challengingly at Edwards.]

     DANIEL
     Colonel, everyone! Please!

   [Edwards looks around once more at the vast force of Unas and then
   reluctantly kneels. All of his men follow his lead.]

   [Iron Shirt looks at them all, accepting their gesture.]

     IRON SHIRT

     Benar.
     (He turns to roar at his followers.)
     A Benar! A tar 'Uman!

   [There is a low rumbling from the Unas. Iron Shirt turns back to
   Daniel.]

     IRON SHIRT
     `On-or.

     DANIEL
     Honor. He understands. Cho'ee'che, Kor Asek.

   [He motions for Iron Shirt to sit.]

   [Iron Shirt kneels before Daniel, who cautiously opens a vest pocket
   and takes out his lighter. Demonstrating with a twig, he shows a
   stunned Iron Shirt how the lighter makes fire, then places the lighter
   on the ground between them, offering a trade. Iron Shirt recognises the
   value of this gift, giving Daniel his precious bone necklace.]

     DANIEL
     Now we can negotiate.

   [Daniel sits.]

     EDWARDS
     How long do we have to kneel?

     DANIEL
     As long as it takes.

   [Chaka nods approvingly. Daniel smiles a little and nods to Iron Shirt.
   Iron Shirt growls back.]

   EXT--P3X-403 SURVEY CAMP, LATER THAT DAY

     IRON SHIRT
     A cha'ka, Dan'al.

     DANIEL
     A cha'ka, Kor Asek.

   [Daniel picks up the bone necklace and stands. He turns to consult with
   Edwards as Iron Shirt shows his lighter to Chaka.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I think we've got ourselves a deal.

     EDWARDS
     And what deal would that be, Dr. Jackson?

     DANIEL
     Well, we've agreed not to desecrate their sacred ground any more.

     EDWARDS
     We have?

     DANIEL
     And in exchange the Unas will honour their dead by helping defeat
     their ancestors' killers, the Goa'uld.

     EDWARDS
     And just how are they going to do that?

     DANIEL
     They're gonna work the mine themselves.

     EDWARDS
     What? Did you propose this?

     DANIEL
     No, actually, it, uh, it was Iron Shirt.

   [They turn to see a thrilled Iron Shirt with a burning twig in his
   hand. Daniel beams.]

     EDWARDS
     Okay, let me get this straight. The Unas are going to mine this
     deposit and turn all the naquadah over to us?

     DANIEL
     That's right

     EDWARDS

     (sighs)
     Can they, uh, work a jackhammer?

     DANIEL
     I think you'll find they're very intelligent and can learn. You
     treat them with honour and respect and, uh, and you're gonna find
     out what kind of allies they can be.

     EDWARDS
     O'Neill was right about you. You are a pain in the ass. But, well
     worth it.

   [He pats Daniel's shoulder and nods.]

   [Daniel smiles and nods before turning to join Chaka and Iron Shirt.
   Iron Shirt proudly displays his burning twig.]

     IRON SHIRT

     (deeply pleased)
     Ah, Dan'al!

   [Daniel nods acknowledgement to Iron Shirt and then looks at Chaka.]

     DANIEL
     Aka.

   [Chaka bows his head.]

   [Daniel smiles gratefully.]

   FADE OUT
