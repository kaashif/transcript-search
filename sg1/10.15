   INT--RING ROOM OF FIRST CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Inside this container are large crates piled around the room. The
   rings activate, and Mitchell appears. He is kneeling on one knee, his
   P-90 at the ready. He turns on the flashlight attached to the gun and
   shines it around the room.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     I'm in.

   [He stands and moves cautiously around, then stops at one of the crates
   and lifts the lid a bit. He looks inside, then lowers the lid. He moves
   to another crate and lifts its lid; the crate is full of metallic bags.
   He removes the lid completely then uses his knife to slice into one of
   the bags. He reaches in and grabs a handful of corn-like kernels, then
   drops them again.]

     MITCHELL

     (into live radio)
     Intel looks good. We got ourselves a space train full of evil
     Orville Redenbacher.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Roger that.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Al'kesh ship is towing a string of very large storage units.
   Mitchell is in the first, Carter the second.]

   INT--RING ROOM OF SECOND CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Carter rings in, looks around quickly then begins pulling items from
   her shoulder pack. She notes a green light passes over her.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     They're scanning us.

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     Let's make this quick.

   [The green scanning lights repeat, but Carter ignores them and
   continues her work.]

   INT--RING ROOM OF FORTH CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Daniel is in the last ship of the "train.' He sets a timer on a small
   device; it is a bomb.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     I'm done.

   INT--RING ROOM OF THIRD CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Teal'c activates the timer on his bomb.]

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     As am I.

   [He steps to the center of the ring platform.]

   INT--RING ROOM OF FIRST CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Mitchell sets the timer on his bomb to one minute and activates it; it
   begins counting down. The rings nearby activate, revealing a group of
   people arriving.]

     MITCHELL
     Crap!

   [The four new arrivals are Lucian Alliance soldiers. Mitchell takes
   cover behind some crates and begins firing on them immediately. He hits
   two but the others take cover and fire back.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF SG-1'S TEL'TAK CARGO SHIP

   [Carter, Daniel, and Teal'c are on the bridge. Vala is sitting in the
   pilot's chair.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Cam, everyone else is on board. Time to get outta there.

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     Yeah, I'd love to, but I got a bit of company!

   [Daniel steps forward in concern. They hear the gunfire over the
   radio.]

     TEAL'C
     I will render assistance.

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     Negative! There's not enough time.

     CARTER

     He's right.
     (into radio)
     Cam, if you can get to the platform, we can ring you out from here.

   INT--RING ROOM OF FIRST CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Only 40 seconds remain on the bomb countdown timer. In the continuing
   firefight, Mitchell hits one more Lucian soldier.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF SG-1'S TEL'TAK CARGO SHIP

   [Carter goes to the ring control console and enters some commands.]

   INT--RING ROOM OF FIRST CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [Only 20 seconds remain. Still firing, Mitchell sees the timer.]

     MITCHELL
     Ah, screw it!

   [He moves out from cover and slides into the middle of the ring
   platform, still firing and threatened by fire.]

     MITCHELL
     Now! Now! Now!

   [The rings activate and take Mitchell away as the Lucian continues
   firing.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF SG-1'S TEL'TAK CARGO SHIP

   [Mitchell arrives unharmed.]

     MITCHELL
     Thanks.

     CARTER

     (calling to the others)
     We got him! Let's go!

   EXT--SPACE

   [SG-1's tel'tak de-cloaks near the large storage train and starts to
   move away.]

   INT--RING ROOM OF FIRST CONTAINER SHIP BEHIND AL'KESH

   [The Lucian soldier looks at the timer as it counts down to zero.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The storage ships behind the Al'kesh blow up one by one, finally
   taking the ship with them.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF LUCIAN HA'TAK MOTHERSHIP

   [The Lucian Alliance leader Netan confers at a table with other men.
   Vashin enters.]

     VASHIN
     Netan.

   [Netan comes around the table to speak to Vashin.]

     VASHIN
     Another transport has been hit near Rolan. We've lost four
     containers full of kassa, plus the Al'kesh escorting them.

     NETAN
     SG-1.

     MALE
     It's the third transport they've hit. Our supply of kassa is getting
     dangerously low.

     NETAN

     (intense and angry)
     This isn't about kassa... This is about them trying to make me look
     weak. I can't allow them to interfere with our operations any
     longer. Put the word out. As of this moment, I'm placing a bounty on
     their heads.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell walks briskly around a corner and sees Vala. He turns around
   immediately and starts back the way he came. Undaunted, Vala follows
   him.]

     VALA

     (cheerily)
     Ooh! Another mission successfully completed.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, it was.

     VALA
     Goodness knows, we've all earned a nice break from routine!

   [Mitchell turns back around but Vala follows again.]

     MITCHELL
     The answer's "no".

     VALA
     You don't know what I'm gonna ask you.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, yes I do.

     VALA
     Alrighty then. I have a better idea of what you're facing than you
     might think. I've done research.

   [Vala steps in front of him, forcing him to stop. He puts a hand to his
   face.]

     MITCHELL

     (pinching his nose)
     Oh god.

   [They have now stopped in the corridor. Vala presses on quickly.]

     VALA

     Traditionally, these events entail the bringing together of large
     groups of people, all with a common bond in the past, but nothing
     really in common in the present. Everybody evaluates each other's
     lot in life, generally by virtue of a combination of material worth
     and the attractiveness of one's date, spouse, life-partner.
     (gesturing to herself)
     Let me go as your date?

     MITCHELL

     (speaking over Vala as she keeps asking)
     No! No! No!

     VALA
     Please! It'll be fun, I promise!

     MITCHELL
     It is a high school reunion, not some swank party. Besides, you will
     be bored out of your mind!

     VALA

     (emphatic)
     Don't you dare talk to me about boredom! Everybody else here has a
     life. Sam, off at a conference. Daniel, in a museum somewhere, doing
     research. Teal'c off-world.

     MITCHELL
     With the Jaffa.

     VALA

     (pleading)
     With the Jaffa, yes. Me? I have absolutely nothing to do.

     MITCHELL
     Vala.

     VALA
     Mmm.

     MITCHELL
     It is in Kansas.

     VALA

     (begging)
     Don't make me beg you.

   INT--CONFERENCE RECEPTION AREA

   [There is a wine reception going on at the "Tomorrow's Technology
   Today" conference. Carter and Lee are dressed in business suits,
   chatting.]

     LEE
     Doesn't it bother you, to come to these--

   [A server offers him a plastic glass of champagne from a tray; he takes
   one.]

     LEE

     (to server)
     Oh, thank you.

     LEE

     (to Carter)
     To come to these conferences to present new technology and actually
     adding flaws, (more quietly)
     I mean pretending we know less than we really do?

     CARTER
     Well, you know the drill. We have to act like there's a process of
     development.

     LEE
     Oh sure, easy for you! You're presenting Chimera. It's practically a
     fully functioning Asgard hologram system. I get stuck with a plasma
     cannon that's supposedly shorts out at the drop of a hat.

   [He notices that behind him, two women are giggling and apparently
   talking about him. They wave to him, smiling. Carter appears
   nonplussed.]

     LEE

     (chuckling)
     On the positive side, these events have a dynamite singles scene.
     It's a huge window of opportunity. I think I'll mingle. You should,
     too.

   [Carter is speechless. Lee takes another glass from the server and
   steps up to the two women, handing a glass to one of them.]

     LEE
     Ladies! Good evening!

   [They smile and laugh at him. Carter appears disturbed by what she
   sees.]

   EXT--COUNTRY ROAD IN KANSAS, DAY

   [Mitchell and Vala drive on a country road. A roadside sign welcomes
   them to the town of Auburn, Shawnee County, Kansas, population 21,211.
   A hand-painted sign welcomes George Washington grads.]

     VALA
     I can't wait to meet your parents!

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, just don't embarrass me.

     VALA
     I would never embarrass you.

   EXT--FRONT YARD OF MITCHELL'S PARENTS' HOUSE, DAY

   [The house is a large, red barn-style house with flowers in front and
   along the side of the walkway to the front door. There are smaller
   buildings and large fields around it. Vala, Mitchell, and his parents
   sit at a picnic table in the yard. It has a table cloth on it. They are
   eating pie with coffee. Everyone is dressed in casual clothing.]

     VALA

     (eating)
     Incredible.

     MITCHELL
     Better than the junk they peddle at the cafeteria, huh?

     VALA
     Oh!

     WENDY MITCHELL
     You'd think she'd never eaten pie before.

     VALA
     I'd no idea it could taste like this.

     FRANK MITCHELL
     I forgot to tell you, Cam. Darrell called. Something about you
     helping set up tomorrow? I left the number on the counter.

     MITCHELL

     (getting up from the table)
     Oh, I'd better give him a call. I'll be right back.

   [Mitchell jogs over to the house and enters.]

     FRANK MITCHELL
     So, Vala.

     VALA
     Uh huh?

     FRANK MITCHELL
     Cam says you work in payroll on the base.

     VALA
     Yes, I'm very good with money.

     FRANK MITCHELL
     Well it's an important skill. Somebody's gotta take care of the
     bills.

     VALA
     Yes and Cameron's so terrible with finances, so...

     WENDY MITCHELL
     Well then, I take it that you two are...quite um...

     FRANK MITCHELL
     Serious?

     VALA

     (uncertain)
     Oh.
     (realizing)
     Absolutely!
     (continuing cheerily)
     Well, I mean at first it was just sex, sex, sex, in all rooms of the
     house at all times of the day! But uh, well, once we got a chance to
     get to know each other, we formed a deeper connection. A spiritual
     bond, you might say.

   [Mitchell's parents look like they are shocked but trying to cover it.]

     WENDY MITCHELL
     Well, I suppose it's nice he found someone.

   [Vala stirs her coffee with a big smile. Mitchell returns to his seat.
   His father gives him a "you old dog" look. Mitchell is confused and
   glances at Vala.]

     MITCHELL
     What?

     WENDY MITCHELL
     More pie?

   [She retrieves the pie. Vala claps her hands and holds up her plate for
   more.]

   INT--MUSEUM

   [The museum has both artifacts and books. Daniel is seated at a large
   wooden table with several chairs around it and books of varying sizes
   on it. They appear to be old hardbacks. Daniel is looking at his laptop
   and taking notes on a yellow pad. He's wearing casual clothes. He gets
   up and goes to one of the stacks. It has another set of shelves on the
   other side of it. He pulls a large book from the shelf. An attractive
   woman is on the other side, peering at him. She is dressed in shiny
   black leather-like material.]

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     Doing some research?

     DANIEL

     Yes.
     (looking up and seeing her, surprised)
     Hi.

   [She smiles grandly at him.]

     DANIEL
     I'm looking for any Aramaic translations of pre-Judeo Pagan hymns,
     hopefully in lithograph form. Am I in the right section?

   [She smiles demurely and crosses her arms on her side of the shelf. She
   has a large black ring on her right hand -- a weapon.]

     DANIEL

     (realizing)
     You don't work here, do you?

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER

     (shaking her head "no" and smiling)
     It's okay. Maybe if we looked together.

     DANIEL

     (smiling slightly)
     No, it's okay. I'll ask at the enquiry desk. They probably have it
     locked up in the rare items archive.

   [She makes a small noise of acknowledgment.]

     DANIEL

     (uncomfortably)
     Uh...thank you.

   [He walks away with the book and his notepad. The woman watches him
   with serious and intense interest.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH

   [A Tel'tak heads toward Earth.]

   INT--SERRAKIN TEL'TAK

   [Two Serrakin aliens are flying the ship.]

     SERRAKIN PILOT
     Activate the scanners.

     SERRAKIN CO-PILOT
     I'm only picking up three signals. One of them must be off-world.

     SERRAKIN PILOT
     We'll find that one later.

   [The ship suddenly rocks; weapons fire is heard. Systems begin shorting
   out.]

     SERRAKIN CO-PILOT
     We're under attack! Shields at zero.

     SERRAKIN PILOT
     Initiating hyper drive!

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH

   [A second Tel'tak fires on the first one. After a few more shots, the
   Serrakin ship explodes.]

   INT--VENTRELL'S TEL'TAK

   [Ventrell speaks rhetorically to the blown-up ship.]

     VENTRELL
     Sorry, boys. I don't like competition.

   INT--MITCHELL'S PARENTS' HOUSE

   [Mrs. Mitchell carries a handful of towels to Mitchell and Vala, who
   are standing at the foot of the stairs.]

     WENDY MITCHELL
     Here's some extra towels. The spare bedroom's all made up.

     MITCHELL
     Right, great. Where do you want me to sleep?

     WENDY MITCHELL

     (a bit confused)
     Well, I thought that you two would...you know.

   [Mitchell laughs nervously while Vala smiles at him.]

     MITCHELL
     No, Mom, that's okay.

     WENDY MITCHELL
     It's all right dear, I'm not as old fashioned as you think.

     MITCHELL

     (baffled)
     What?

     WENDY MITCHELL

     (to Vala)
     You know, I think Cam sometimes finds it convenient to forget that I
     grew up in the sixties. I could tell you some stories.

     MITCHELL
     No, Mom! No, Mother, please! Not, No. We don't wanna hear your
     stories.

     VALA

     (sincerely)
     I do.

     MITCHELL
     No!

     WENDY MITCHELL

     (conspiratorially, to Vala)
     We'll talk later.

     VALA

     (happily)
     Okay.

   [Wendy leaves.]

     VALA
     I like your mother.

     MITCHELL

     (taking a towel, disturbed)
     Uh...I'll be on the couch.

   [He walks away.]

     VALA
     Your loss.

   [She turns toward the stairs.]

   EXT--JAFFA PLANET, DAY

   [Cha'ra and Teal'c approach the DHD of the planet.]

     CHA'RA
     I can only hope you'll reconsider and accept the seat the Council's
     offering you.

     TEAL'C
     You have been speaking to Bra'tac.

     CHA'RA
     He only asked that I voice the opinion of any clear-minded Jaffa.
     The reformation of our government cannot occur without the help--

   [Teal'c hears something and holds up a hand to silence Cha'ra. Energy
   weapons fire erupts, aimed at them.]

     TEAL'C
     Down!

   [They take cover behind the DHD. The beam weapons cut down the trees
   behind them. After a lull, Teal'c and Cha'ra stand up and start firing
   back into the bushes and woods with their staff weapons. There is no
   response, and after a moment they cease firing. There is the sound of
   people running away over the leafy ground.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you injured?

     CHA'RA

     No.
     (concerned, seeing a wound on Teal'c's side)
     But you are.

   [Teal'c looks at Cha'ra with a concerned, questioning expression.]

   EXT--TENT SETTLEMENT ON JAFFA PLANET, DAY

   [There is a small settlement comprised of several large tents beside
   some woods and a cliff.]

   INT--TENT

   [Teal'c sits with his shirt off. A Jaffa cleans the large surface wound
   on Teal'c's right side. Cha'ra enters.]

     CHA'RA
     The men guarding the gate report no activity. It is possible whoever
     attacked us left by cloaked cargo ship.

     TEAL'C
     Or perhaps they are still here waiting for the opportunity to finish
     the job. Put out word that I indeed survived the attack, but that I
     am gravely injured.

   [Cha'ra smiles and bows slightly, then walks out.]

   INT--GEORGE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM, AUBURN, KANSAS

   [People are preparing for the reunion party. One man works on the
   lighting while another holds the large stuffed Bumble Bee mascot.
   Mitchell and his friend Darrell Grimes sit at a table covered with
   plastic red and white table cloths. They are filling out name tags with
   black felt pens. Vala is dressed in a "Daisy Duke" outfit, a halter top
   and very short jean shorts.]

     MITCHELL
     ...So, so this is on Mister Armstrong. He walks into the classroom,
     then he sees his car...

   [Mitchell and Grimes laugh heartily.]

     MITCHELL
     ...the whole car, sitting in the middle of the room. It's got a
     fresh coat of wax, it's looking all brand new...

     DARRELL

     (laughing)
     We all thought he was gonna drop dead from heart failure, right
     there on the floor.

     VALA
     And then what happened?

     DARRELL

     (pausing in his laughter for a moment)
     Well, that's it! I mean, we had to take the car back out and put it
     together again, but...

   [He trails off laughing when Vala doesn't join in.]

     VALA

     (serious and bemused)
     Ah, if I understand you correctly, you had to completely disassemble
     and then reassemble this automobile, not once but twice.

     DARRELL
     Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

   [Mitchell and Darrell resume laughing.]

     VALA
     You know what? It does remind me of an incident from my own youth.

   [Mitchell looks warily at Vala.]

     VALA
     Uh huh. A trader came through my village with a crate. The--

   [Mitchell pinches her back to stop her.]

     VALA
     Ow!

     MITCHELL
     Hey, you know, you hear one high school story, you've heard 'em all.

   [Some women nearby have heard Vala scream and have turned to look.
   Darrell notices them looking.]

     DARRELL
     Cam, five 'o'clock, five 'o'clock. Mmm Hmm!

   [Mitchell turns to look behind him.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh lord.

     VALA
     What?

     DARRELL
     That is...

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I know who it is.

   [The woman starts walking toward them, holding flowers.]

     DARRELL
     She's coming over here.

     VALA
     Why are you whispering like that? What's going on?

   [The woman sets the flowers on the next table.]

     DARRELL
     Shhh.

   [The woman arrives.]

     AMY
     Cameron Mitchell, right?

   [She holds out her hand.]

     AMY
     Amy...

   [Mitchell nods and starts to stand but accidentally kicks the chair out
   from under him. He barely avoids falling to the floor. He picks up the
   chair, which has folded itself up.]

     AMY
     Oh my goodness.

     MITCHELL

     (embarrassed)
     Oh, sorry. Vandenberg, yes! Yes, the name definitely rings a bell.

   [Darrell stands up. He and Vala look uncomfortable on Mitchell's
   behalf.]

     AMY
     I just saw you over here and I thought I'd say "hi". Been a long
     time.

     MITCHELL

     (focused)
     Yeah, it has.

   [Darrell nods at him.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, uh, you remember Darrell, right?

     DARRELL
     Hey. Homeroom, tenth grade?

   [They shake hands.]

     AMY
     Right!

     DARRELL
     How you doing?

     AMY
     Good!

     DARRELL
     Good to see you.

     AMY
     Good.

   [Mitchell seems to have forgotten Vala, who stands behind him.]

     VALA

     (holding out her hand)
     And Vala Mal Doran. I'm Cameron's date.

   [Amy's smile disappears. She shakes hands with Vala.]

     AMY

     Right, of course. I should have realized.
     (awkwardly)
     Well it was really nice seeing you, er, meeting you, again.

   [Mitchell nods and smiles.]

     AMY
     Okay, I'm gonna go help now. I'll see you tonight.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, I'll be here.

   [She walks away.]

     MITCHELL
     Darrell?

     DARRELL
     She looked back, and she looks good.

   [Amy has turned to look at Mitchell, then turns back and continues
   walking. She is greeted to two interested women friends. Mitchell sets
   his chair upright, unfolds, and sits in it.]

     VALA
     Well, well, well.

   [She walks around Mitchell and hits him in the back of the head. She
   stops and leans back against the table, right next to Darrell. Darrell
   glances over at her tummy and legs.]

     VALA
     Someone likes you.

     MITCHELL

     No, she's just nice.
     (uncertainly)
     And she's probably on the welcoming committee or something.

     VALA
     Um hmm... Darrell.

     DARRELL

     (after glancing at her again)
     Yes.

     VALA
     What do people do around here for fun?

     DARRELL
     For fun. Umm...

   [She smiles at him hopefully.]

   INT--MUSEUM

   [Back at the table, Daniel writes in his yellow pad, which is atop a
   large book. He's now wearing a leather jacket. The bounty hunter
   approaches and sits on the table, across from him in a suggestive
   pose.]

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     Hello again.

     DANIEL

     (looking up, surprised)
     Hello.

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     I've been watching. You really enjoy this kind of work, don't you?

     DANIEL
     You've been watching me?

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     Well, I guess it's kind of hard not to. You're very attractive.

   [Daniel looks around behind him as if expecting this to be a practical
   joke.]

     DANIEL
     What's uh...what's goin' on?

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     I was thinking we could get out of here, go somewhere? Together?
     Alone?

   [Daniel looks alert for a moment, then softens his expression into shy
   sincerity.]

     DANIEL
     Wow, uh... You know, I'm not really the most impulsive person...
     Flattering as your offer is, I'm gonna have to say "no".

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER

     (coldly)
     Have it your way.

   [She lifts her right hand to fire on him with the black ring. Perhaps
   expecting an attack, Daniel quickly lifts the book in front of him and
   it blocks the blast. The book lights in flame. He throws it at her then
   turns to run. She fires at him as he slides to the floor and around a
   corner. She activates a device beneath her jacket.]

   EXT--STREET NEAR MUSEUM, DAY

   [Daniel runs down the street and across another street. He hears her
   materialize behind him and stops. Standing on the edge of the sidewalk,
   she aims her weapon at a woman nearby who is tending to her baby in a
   carriage.]

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     Stop or I start killing people.

   [Daniel turns to face her. Seeing the threatened woman, he raises his
   hands. The bounty hunter swings her arm toward Daniel.]

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     Good.

   [She walks toward him, into the street.]

     FEMALE ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER
     You should have taken my first offer, Doctor Jackson. It would have
     been far less painful.

   [A city bus suddenly hits the woman, carrying her several feet. The bus
   screeches to a halt. Daniel lowers his hands and looks toward the front
   of the bus in shock.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry is standing at the phone speaking to Carter as Harriman sits in
   front of the gate controls.]

     LANDRY
     She was human but not from Earth. Weapons were based on Goa'uld
     design.

   INT--BACKSTAGE AT CONFERENCE HALL

     LANDRY

     (over phone)
     We need to figure out how she got here.

     CARTER

     (into cell phone)
     Well, my guess would be a cloaked cargo ship.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY
     So, we've got an invisible hunk of alien technology sitting out in a
     field somewhere.

   INT--BACKSTAGE AT CONFERENCE HALL

     CARTER
     Well, cloaked ships aren't entirely undetectable, sir. They do give
     off anomalous energy readings. If it's stationary and we know
     approximately where to look, we might be able to find it.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY
     I've already sent a team to assist Doctor Jackson with his
     investigation.

   INT--BACKSTAGE AT CONFERENCE HALL

     CARTER
     Well if you need my help, sir, I can certainly come back.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY
     Negative, Colonel. We can handle it. I just wanted to make sure you
     were all right. Besides, I have a feeling you'll be of more value
     where you are. Landry out.

   INT--CONFERENCE HALL

   [Carter hangs up the phone and peaks around the edge of the stage
   curtain to watch as Bill Lee gives his lecture and demonstration. Near
   Lee is a large, modern looking gun on a metal stand.]

     LEE
     Of all the dreams of science fiction into scientific reality, this
     one in particular has remained elusive...until now. Ladies and
     gentlemen: welcome to the future!

   [Lee pivots the gun to point at a paper target on a concrete wall that
   has been set up. He turns on the gun and activates it. It makes a loud
   humming noise then spits out a spray of sparks and shuts down without
   having fired.]

     LEE

     Oh, gee! Sorry, sorry. I can fix this. Just um, just give me a
     moment here. (leaning over to examine the gun)
     Um...

   [Carter looks around in slight embarrassment.]

   EXT--FIELD IN KANSAS, DAY

   [Mitchell is talking into his cell phone with his hand over his other
   ear.]

     MITCHELL
     Say that again, sir!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     LANDRY
     It's not urgent. I just wanted to fill you in, Colonel.

     MITCHELL

     (very garbled)
     Sorry. I just can't hear anything you're saying.

   [Landry gestures to Harriman for an explanation.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sorry sir, his cell's barely coming through.

   [Landry scowls as he hears gunfire over Mitchell's phone.]

   EXT--FIELD IN KANSAS, DAY

     MITCHELL

     (into phone)
     Hang on a second.

   [Vala and Darrell are firing rifles at tin cans perched atop hay bales
   in the distance. Vala hits a can.]

     MITCHELL
     Darrell, you got a cellphone that works?

     DARRELL
     No, no one does. Two cell repeaters went down after last month's
     twister. The phone company hasn't put up new ones yet.

   [Darrell fires and misses.]

     DARRELL
     Damn!

     MITCHELL

     Great.
     (into phone)
     Everything's good here, sir!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     MITCHELL

     (over garbled connection)
     However, if there is cause for concern, we can come back right away.

     LANDRY

     (into phone)
     Not necessary, son. Sounds like you two are having a hell of a time.

   EXT--FIELD IN KANSAS, DAY

     MITCHELL

     (into phone)
     Oh yeah, me and Daisy, we're living large!

   [He pulls the phone away from his ear and looks at it.]

     MITCHELL
     And, no signal.

   [Vala fires and hits another can.]

     DARRELL

     (admiringly)
     Whoo! Hoo hoo!

     VALA
     Tell me about this girl back at the school.

     DARRELL
     Who, Amy?

     VALA

     (smiling but holding a stalk of wheat in her teeth)
     Yeah.

     DARRELL
     Oh, Cam always had a thing for her.

     VALA
     Really.

     DARRELL
     Guy could have had any girl he wanted in the whole school, but every
     time she walked by, he'd start stammering like an idiot.

     VALA
     No.

     DARRELL
     Yep.

     VALA
     Did they ever...?

     DARRELL
     Nah. He never had the courage to ask her out. She ended up marrying
     some corporate dude and moving to Texas.

   [Darrell fires and misses again.]

     DARRELL
     Damn!

   [Vala fires and hits another can.]

     DARRELL
     What department did you say you work in, again?

     VALA
     Accounts...receivable.

   [She cocks the weapon again and sighs.]

   INT--CONFERENCE HALL

   [A presenter stands at a podium, introducing the next speaker.]

     PRESENTER
     A nine-year veteran of the Air Force's Deep Space Telemetry Program
     as well as senior consultant for applied technologies...

   [In the rafters at the rear of the hall, a black-eyed alien assassin
   sets down a hard case and begins to open it as the presenter speaks.]

     PRESENTER
     ...and a two time winner of the prestigious Binder prize for
     advancements in theoretical physics. Please welcome to the stage
     Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

   [The assassin begins to assemble an energy-style weapon. Lee holds back
   the drape and Carter walks onto the stage. She is wearing a business
   suit. She stands at the podium while the audience applauds.]

     CARTER
     Thank you. As most of you will recall, three years ago I went on
     network television in order to dispel the erroneous charge that the
     Air Force was covering up the existence of alien life in our galaxy.
     Today I'll be following up on that same technology I introduced
     then, by showing you several new features which dramatically enhance
     its effectiveness.

   [As she speaks, on the large projection screen is an image of the
   holographic Asgard she introduced in that news segment. In the rafters,
   the assassin completes assembly of the weapon, powers it, and aims it
   at Carter using its electronic display.]

     CARTER
     I am of course speaking of the Chimera Optics Projection System. As
     you'll soon see, further research and development has provided
     longer range, better verisimilitude and more control over image
     projection since Chimera's introduction as a prototype three years
     ago.

   [The assassin fires his energy weapon right at Carter. But, Carter
   isn't really there -- it is a holographic projection of her. She is
   really behind the stage. The blast passes right through the projection
   and hits the temporary wall behind her. Carter steps away in reaction,
   as shown by the hologram. She turns off the device, and her image
   disappears. The audience reacts with alarm, exclaiming and looking
   around. Behind the stage, Carter and Lee kneel beside a table.]

     LEE
     What the hell was that?

     CARTER
     Someone just took a shot at me.

   [In the rafters, the assassin looks around frantically for a target.
   Lee and Carter see him from where they are behind the wall, which
   doesn't reach all the way to the ceiling.]

     CARTER
     There!

     LEE
     Holy crap!

     CARTER
     We need to get the X-699 working now.

   [They move to Lee's defective weapon and Carter goes to the power
   source.]

     LEE
     Try bypassing the main power coupling. You might get one shot off
     before it short circuits.

   [The audience looks around nervously, chatters and wonders whether this
   is part of the presentation. Having made the adjustment to the gun,
   Carter activates and lifts it from its mount. It emits a tone of
   increasing pitch. She aims it up at the assassin and fires. The energy
   blast hits him; he falls to the floor of the rafter area. The audience
   stands and claps for Lee and Carter, some noting it was a great show.]

     LEE
     Nice demo.

   EXT--JAFFA PLANET, NIGHT

   [The tent settlement is quiet and lightly lit by fires.]

   INT--TENT ON JAFFA PLANET

   [Teal'c lies still on a pallet as if he is gravely wounded. A man
   wearing a hooded cloak enters quietly. He pulls a knife and prepares to
   stab Teal'c with it. Teal'c pulls out a zat and zats the man, who falls
   unconscious. Cha'ra rushes in to peer at the man.]

     CHA'RA
     He is Jaffa!

   [Teal'c kneels beside the man.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe so.

   [Teal'c rubs the false Jaffa tattoo off the man's forehead.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [The reunion dance is in full swing. A DJ chooses records.]

     MAN

     (to DJ)
     Do you have any Journey? Awesome!

   [At the entrance, Mitchell and Vala have just arrived and are putting
   on their adhesive name tags. Mitchell wears a suit, Vala a black
   evening dress. A woman, Jackie, sees Mitchell. Behind her is a large
   poster full of yearbook pictures with "Class of 1987" in the middle.]

     JACKIE

     (recognizing him)
     Cameron? Hey, welcome back!

     MITCHELL
     Jackie, hey!

     JACKIE
     And...Vayla?

     VALA
     Vala.

     JACKIE
     Vala. Now, I can't remember, did you go to GW?

     VALA
     Oh, I didn't attend school. As much as I was sold as a domestic
     servant to a weapons smuggler named Fierenze. After I killed him and
     won my freedom, I considered my education more or less complete.

   [The woman is wide-eyed with shock for a moment, then recovers
   herself.]

     JACKIE
     Well, it was sure nice to meet you.

   [Jackie makes a hasty retreat.]

     MITCHELL

     (grabbing Vala and moving her to the side)
     Maybe... we should keep chat like that to a minimum.

   [He brings her to stand beside the large bumble bee mascot for a photo
   opportunity.]

     MITCHELL
     Smile.

   EXT--PARKING LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL GYM, NIGHT

   [A man, Phil is making his way to the party. He stops to spray breath
   freshener into his mouth. He is hit by a stunner and falls to the
   pavement. An Oranian alien looms over him.]

     PHIL
     Oh, god. Oh, god! Please don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me!

   [The Oranian fires on him again, leaving him unconscious. The Oranian
   runs a scanner over the man's body, then attaches a device like that of
   the Foothold Aliens to his own chest. He morphs into the appearance and
   clothing of Phil.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [Mitchell, Vala, and alumnus Gary sit at a table.]

     GARY
     So you've got like, eleven different policies you can buy. You got
     your basic four of course: house, fire, boat, car...

     VALA

     Wait, let me get this straight.
     (referring to Mitchell)
     He buys one of your policies and names... me as his beneficiary. I
     would collect all of the money in the event of his untimely death.

     GARY
     You got it!

   [Mitchell does not look at Vala or react to her at all. He appears
   painfully bored. Vala tosses him her empty plastic cup.]

     VALA
     Tell me more.

   [Mitchell gets up, still without looking at her.]

     GARY
     Well, let me tell you, Vala...

   [In the hallway, a woman applies a name badge to the fake Phil.]

   EXT--PARKING LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL GYM, NIGHT

   [A large man makes his way toward the gym. Another man, Odai Ventrell,
   approaches him.]

     VENTRELL
     Hello there.

     FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER
     Can I help you?

     VENTRELL
     As a matter of fact, you can. Your suit looks like it's about my
     size.

     FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER
     So?

   [Ventrell slugs the man, and he goes down.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [Mitchell fills Vala's cup from the punch bowl, then adds a fair amount
   of alcohol to it. Amy Vandenberg approaches him from behind. She's
   wearing a strappy dress; her hair and make-up are "done".]

     AMY
     Nice suit.

     MITCHELL

     (impressed)
     Wow. Look at you!

     AMY

     (chuckling, trying to find a place to attach her name tag)
     Don't quite know where to put this.

     MITCHELL
     Oh that, no. That's 'cause you don't need that.

   [He takes it from her and tosses it away.]

     AMY
     So, where's your date?

     MITCHELL
     Date? Oh, Vala. Vala. Vala is over there plotting my death with Gary
     Walesco.

     AMY

     (laughing)
     Well, she seems nice. You two make a good couple.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, no we don't. She um... Well, she's just a friend.

     AMY

     (nodding)
     Oh.

     MITCHELL
     So, where is your other half?

     AMY
     In Maui with his girlfriend, most likely. Ted and I got divorced
     about a year and a half ago. I moved back to Topeka last year.

     MITCHELL
     I'm sorry to hear that.

     AMY
     Oh, don't be. I'm not.

     MITCHELL
     You look exactly the same.

     AMY
     I'm surprised you even remember what I looked like back then.

     MITCHELL
     Are you kidding?

     AMY
     No.

     MITCHELL
     You know I had a major-league crush on you, right?

     AMY

     (pushing him in the chest)
     No!

     MITCHELL
     Yes! Yes! Look, I had your entire schedule memorized, so I'd be in
     the right place when I got outta class. And that sounds creepy now
     that I say it out loud.

     AMY
     How come you never said anything?

     MITCHELL
     I was sixteen. I was sixteen and-and you were always hooked up with
     some other guy! And, let's be honest about it, you were way, way
     outta my league. Oh, god, I can't believe I just told you that.

     AMY
     Okay, now it's my turn. I saw every football game you ever played
     in. I can name every class we shared together. I even broke up with
     Bobby Haversham hoping that you would ask me out to the senior prom.
     But you never did! I guess you could say I haven't quite forgiven
     you for that yet.

   [He steps toward her then stops, disappointed, as his cell phone starts
   ringing.]

     AMY
     I think your phone is ringing.

     MITCHELL

     Yeah, it is. Sorry.
     (into phone)
     Mitchell. Hello?

     LANDRY

     (over phone, garbled)
     This is General Landry.

     MITCHELL

     (into phone)
     Hello?

     LANDRY

     (over phone, garbled)
     Mitchell!

   [He can't make contact with Landry.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Amy)
     Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
     (starting to walk away but still talking to her)
     Uh, I'll be right back. You! You do not move from this spot!

     AMY

     (mock saluting him)
     Yes, sir!

   [He smiles and walks away. The Serrakin disguised as Phil sees him and
   starts to follow, but is stopped by Gary, who believes he has found
   Phil.]

     GARY
     Phil?! Man, I haven't seen you since... the last one of these
     shindigs!

   [Gary slaps "Phil" on the shoulders several times.]

     GARY
     You look great! You been working out? Huh? So, how's Nancy?

   ["Phil" touches Gary, and Gary's head starts vibrating hard back and
   forth. After a moment, "Phil" stops, and Gary sinks down into a chair
   and stares ahead blankly. "Phil" exits the gym.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY

   [The hallway has the usual lockers lining the walls. On various walls
   and display cases are signs reading "Damian Kindler for Class
   Treasurer" and "Peter DeLuise for Class Secretary." Mitchell is walking
   and trying to talk to Landry on the cell phone with a poor connection.]

     MITCHELL

     (into phone)
     I'm sorry, sir, say that again. Carter and Teal'c what?

     LANDRY
     Were attacked.

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [Darrell is just entering; the greeter gives him his name tag.]

     DARRELL
     Yeah, I'll put it on myself. Thank you, sweetie. Okay.

   [He spots Vala across the way, looking at the poster of old yearbook
   photos. He smoothes his hair back and heads toward her. Along the way
   he sees Gary and pats him on the shoulder.]

     DARRELL
     Hey Gary, how you doin', buddy?

   [Gary slumps over a bit more.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY

   [Mitchell proceeds down a hallway, looking for a pay phone. "Phil"
   takes up a position behind him and points a weapon at him. Before he
   can fire, Ventrell grabs "Phil's" head and slams it into the wall, then
   covers his mouth. Mitchell stops and turns back as if he has heard
   something. After a moment, he continues. Ventrell drags "Phil" into a
   custodian's closet and deactivates the Oranian's disguise mechanism.
   Ventrell leaves him there on the floor and closes the door.]

     DARRELL

     DARRELL
     Hi.

     VALA
     Have you seen Mitchell? I can't find him anywhere.

     DARRELL
     "Mitchell"? Wow! You two are on a last name basis, huh? Uh, I think
     I saw him talking to Amy Vandenberg.

     VALA
     Oh, the one from...

     DARRELL
     Yeah, I think they slunk off together.

     VALA

     (smiling but sarcastic)
     Perfect.

     DARRELL

     (pulling a flask from his jacket)
     Yeah, um...would you uh...like a little refreshment?

   [She holds up her empty cup as if to say she doesn't need any more.]

     DARRELL

     Moonshine.
     (noting her continued misunderstanding)
     It's flammable.

   [She drops her cup to the floor, grabs him by the tie and pulls him
   away.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY

   [Mitchell has found a pay-phone and has called the SGC.]

     MITCHELL

     (into phone)
     This is Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell for General Landry. Thank you.

   [As he waits, Ventrell walks up and points a gun at him.]

     VENTRELL
     Just the man I've been lookin' for.

     MITCHELL

     (not asking, but stating)
     We didn't go to school together, did we?

     VENTRELL
     Name's Ventrell. I'm here to collect the price on your head.

     MITCHELL
     Big bad bounty hunter after little old me? I'm honored.

     VENTRELL
     Actually, you're just the bait.

     LANDRY

     (over phone, audible to both men)
     This is General Landry. Mitchell! Mitchell, can you read me?
     Mitchell?

   [Ventrell takes the phone from MItchell and touches a device on his
   neck. When he speaks, it is in Mitchell's voice.]

     VENTRELL
     This is Mitchell. Requesting assistance. Repeat, requesting
     assistance.

   [He hangs up the phone.]

     MITCHELL
     My voice is way deeper than that.

     VENTRELL
     Funny. See, I'm after the big prize.

     MITCHELL

     (realizing)
     All of SG-1.

     VENTRELL
     Who do you think they'll send after they hear that?

     MITCHELL
     Why don't you just take me? Teal'c's not even on the planet.

     VENTRELL
     Oh, they'll be here. In the meantime, all you have to do is keep
     quiet and no one gets hurt. Now, shall we get back to the party?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, lets dance.

   [The walk away.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Landry is walking with Teal'c, Carter, and Daniel. The latter three
   are dressed in black BDU's with tac vests and weapons.]

     LANDRY
     Unfortunately, the Odyssey is not available for transport, but we've
     got a couple of 302s waiting. They should get you there pretty
     quick.

     TEAL'C
     Do we know how the assassins have been able to target us so
     precisely?

     CARTER
     I think so. During our last mission we were hit by what we thought
     was a scanning beam. Turns out it was a little more sophisticated
     than that. We were tagged. We're all emitting low levels of a
     particularly exotic form of radiation. That's what they're tracking.
     Now, the good news is, it has a limited half-life, so it should wear
     off in a couple of days.

     LANDRY
     I think it's pretty clear Colonel Mitchell doesn't have a couple of
     days.

     DANIEL
     We'll get him, sir.

   [The three enter the Level 25 elevator.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL THEATER

   [Darrell and Vala are seated in the front row of the theater. Vala is
   drinking from the flask and has her legs draped over Darrell's. After
   taking a large sip, she hands the flask to Darrell.]

     DARRELL
     Wow! You know what? I think Mitchell is crazy for ditching you.

     VALA
     Hmm.

     DARRELL
     I mean, come on, god, look at you! You're a beautiful woman. You
     have a keen mind, and you shoot like a special forces sniper.

     VALA
     True. All true.

     DARRELL
     But, you can be a little scary, though.

   [Vala pulls off her name tag.]

     DARRELL
     I mean, to the kind of guy that would be intimidated by a woman who
     is successful and brilliant like you are.

     VALA
     Hmm.

     DARRELL
     But you know what?

   [They lean very close to each other.]

     VALA
     What?

     I'm not one of those guys.

     VALA
     Darrell?

     DARRELL
     Uh huh?

     VALA
     There's something I think I'm supposed to tell you now.

     DARRELL
     What?

     VALA
     I'm married.

     (leaning away, very disappointed)
     Ah, you're kidding!

     VALA
     Mmm.

     DARRELL
     Ahhh.

     VALA
     It's something I don't like to talk about much.

   [She sticks her name-tag over his mouth.]

     VALA
     He's a religious zealot, bent on total domination of every human
     being in this galaxy.

     DARRELL
     So you're separated?

   [Amy looks around for Mitchell. He arrives with Ventrell.]

     AMY
     There you are! I thought you'd deserted me.

     MITCHELL

     (tightly)
     Hey.

     AMY
     You okay?

     MITCHELL
     I'm fine.

     AMY
     Who's your friend?

     VENTRELL
     Odai Ventrell at your service.

   [He takes her hand and kisses it.]

     AMY
     Hello.

     VENTRELL
     I'm a friend of the Colonel's.

   [Amy looks around at the dancers then back at Mitchell.]

     AMY
     You still owe me a dance.

     VENTRELL
     Don't keep the lady waiting, Colonel. You won't get another chance.

   [She leads him onto the dance floor; a slow dance number is starting.
   He unbuttons his suit coat. He appears worried but dances with her
   anyway.]

     AMY
     Are you sure your date won't mind us spending time together like
     this?

     MITCHELL
     She's the independent type. Maybe too much so.

   [He looks over to see Ventrell watching them.]

     AMY
     You know what I like? Now that we're older and hopefully wiser, we
     can say how we really feel. There's none of that awful tension that
     used to hang in the air when we were young.

     MITCHELL

     (tense and distracted)
     Yeah, I'm glad that's gone.

   [Vala and Darrell arrive at the entrance to the gym. Vala sees Ventrell
   and recognizes him. She grabs Darrell and turns him around against the
   door jamb, where they are somewhat hidden.]

     DARRELL

     (thinking she is making a play)
     Oh, I like this!

     VALA

     Huh? Oh shut up!
     (looking around the door frame to make sure)
     That's Odai Ventrell in there.

     DARRELL
     Who?

     VALA
     No!

   [Darrell tries to look, but she pulls him back.]

     VALA
     Bounty hunter. He's obviously here looking for me!

     DARRELL
     Okay, no more liquor for you tonight, all right?

     VALA
     What? Oh, don't be ridiculous. That stuff barely affects me.

   [She begins to pat him down.]

     VALA
     Have you got any weapons on you?

     DARRELL

     (in a high voice)
     No!

     VALA
     Then we'll have to improvise.

   [Darrell looks completely confused.]

   [On the dance floor, Mitchell is looking around warily, not paying
   attention to the slow dance with Amy. She senses his unhappiness and
   stops dancing.]

     AMY
     Hey, if you don't wanna do this.

     MITCHELL
     No, it's not that. It's just...it's complicated.

     AMY
     You don't have to say anything else. I get the message. Vala, right?

   [Seeing Ventrell staring at them with a scowl, Mitchell puts his hand
   around the back of Amy's neck and leans over to whisper in her ear.]

     MITCHELL
     It's not what you think. Right now, I need you to slap me and get
     out of here.

   [Darrell approaches Ventrell.]

     DARRELL

     (talking very loudly)
     Dave "the man" Nelson. It's Darrell! How you doing, man?

   [He grabs Ventrell by the shoulders in greeting.]

     VENTRELL

     (pushing him away)
     You're confusing me with someone else.

     DARRELL
     What?

   [Mitchell sees what is going on.]

     MITCHELL
     Darrell! Get the hell out of here!

     DARRELL

     (in a drunken voice)
     Oh what, like I'm going to listen to you? Huh? Making time with
     another girl, leaving your date high and dry. Well thank god I
     stepped up, huh, Dave? Thank god!

   [Ventrell grabs Darrell's hand and twists it behind his back, forcing
   Darrell to his knees. Darrell cries out in pain.]

     VENTRELL
     Touch me again, and I'll kill you.

     DARRELL
     Dave, you've changed, dude!

   [Ventrell releases Darrell's arm. Darrell cries out again then gets up
   slowly, holding his left upper arm. Ventrell pulls a large wrist device
   from under his suit sleeve and activates something. From behind him,
   Vala throws a fire extinguisher at Ventrell's back. It bounces off the
   force shield he has just activated. He turns around to face Vala.]

     VALA

     (smiling and waving a finger)
     Hi.

   [Ventrell backhands Vala, sending her flying onto a table and over onto
   the floor. The music stops with a screech of vinyl.]

     DARRELL
     Oh!

   [Mitchell tries to rush in, but Ventrell pull his energy pistol and
   aims it at Mitchell. The alumni call out and scream.]

     VENTRELL
     Get. Back.

   [The attendees start running for the exits, still screaming. Ventrell
   activates his wrist device again, causing all the doors to the gym to
   close. Some people press on the doors and pound on the windows, trying
   to get out or call for help. Ventrell fires his gun at the ceiling. The
   people see it and turn toward him, cowering but quiet.]

     VENTRELL

     Your attention, please! Exiting this room is now impossible. Every
     door has been magnetically sealed shut.
     (to Vala)
     Vala Mal Doran. This is my lucky day.
     (gesturing for her to move over to Mitchell)
     Netan's offering a bonus for anyone who bags you.

     VALA

     (to Mitchell)
     Sorry. That didn't go well.

     VENTRELL
     Oh, it's worse than you think. Thanks to your little stunt, now I
     start killing people.

     MITCHELL
     You don't have to do this.

     VENTRELL

     First rule of hostage taking: always back up your threats. So who's
     it gonna be? (pointing weapon at Darrell)
     The trouble maker?

     DARRELL

     (pleading, putting up his hands)
     Hey! Oh, please.

     VENTRELL

     (aiming at Amy)
     Or the girlfriend?

     AMY

     (moving behind Mitchell, panicked)
     Cameron!

     VENTRELL
     Choose, Colonel, or they both die!

     VALA

     (stepping in front of Mitchell)
     Oh Ventrell, you always were such a coward!

     VENTRELL
     I guess we'll start with you.

   [Vala lets out a breath of frustration and prepares to argue when a
   voice comes over Ventrell's wrist communications device.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     This is Colonel Carter of SG-1. Once all the hostages have been
     released, we are willing to beam in.

     VENTRELL

     (into radio)
     Negative. You and SG-1 beam in first, unarmed, and then I'll let
     everyone go.

   [Teal'c, Daniel, and Carter beam into the gym, unarmed. The attendees
   call out in amazement.]

     VENTRELL

     (directing the new arrivals to the center of the room)
     Over there, please! Colonel Mitchell, Vala, would you mind joining
     the others?

   [They join the rest of SG-1 as Jackie and Darrell look on very
   worriedly.]

     VENTRELL
     Turn around.

   [SG-1 all face away from Ventrell.]

     MITCHELL
     So what's your endgame, Ventrell? You know we're not just gonna let
     you walk outta here.

     VENTRELL
     Never planned on it.

   [He activates his wrist device again. A set of rings comes crashing
   through the roof of the gym to surround SG-1 and Ventrell. Vala and
   Mitchell are ringed away, but Carter, Daniel, and Teal'c remain. They
   are holograms just as Carter was earlier. Carter and Teal'c walk out of
   the frame and disappear. Amy, Jackie, and Darrell appear completely
   shocked.]

   INT--VENTRELL'S TEL'TAK

   [Ventrell, Vala, and Mitchell ring aboard. Behind Ventrell are Teal'c
   and Carter, pointing weapons at him.]

     CARTER
     Hello.

   [Mitchell disarms him. Daniel is still in the holographic frame. He
   turns and waves.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [Daniel waves to the crowd.]

     DANIEL

     (cheerily)
     It's okay. You're all safe now.

     DARRELL

     (panicked)
     Yeah, but what happened to Vala?

   INT--VENTRELL'S TEL'TAK

   [Carter deactivates the holographic cameras.]

   INT--HIGH SCHOOL GYM

   [Daniel disappears.]

     DARRELL
     Holy crap!

     JACKIE
     I knew there was something wrong with that woman!

   INT--VENTRELL'S TEL'TAK

   [Ventrell is surrounded by SG-1. Teal'c hands plastic hand-cuffs to
   Mitchell, who hands them to Vala.]

     VALA

     How did you do that?
     (taking the cuffs)
     Oh, allow me!

   [She ties Ventrell's hands behind his back.]

     TEAL'C
     We located this vessel in a field several miles from here. We were
     on-board trying to override the command code when it was remotely
     activated and flown onto the roof of the school.

     DANIEL

     (to Ventrell)
     That's right! You brought us to you.

     CARTER
     After that it was a simple matter of activating Chimera. It's an
     Asgard holographic projection system. It made it look like we'd
     beamed in.

   [Vala rests her hands on Ventrell's shoulder in a playful way.]

     DANIEL
     And you might have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for us
     meddling kids.

     MITCHELL
     So much for your big payday.

     VENTRELL
     Well I may not be able to collect, but it doesn't mean others won't
     try.

     MITCHELL
     Unless there's a bigger payday waiting somewhere else.

     VENTRELL
     What are you talking about?

     MITCHELL
     Well I've had some experience recently dealing with the Lucian
     Alliance. I know for a fact that some of Netan's seconds are
     starting to question his leadership. After this little fiasco, it's
     only gonna get worse.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. With his failure to eliminate us yet again, he will only
     appear weaker than before.

     MITCHELL
     No doubt about it. There is blood in the water. The only question
     is, which enterprising shark will be the first to take advantage of
     it.

   [Ventrell appears intrigued.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Netan's ha'tak mothership is in orbit around a planet.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF LUCIAN HA'TAK MOTHERSHIP

   [Netan stands beside a viewscreen, gazing out. A fight breaks out in
   the corridor outside the bridge. There is weapons fire. One man falls
   near the entrance. A large bounty hunter enters and aims a weapon at
   Netan. Before he can fire, he is shot in the back and falls. Ventrell
   was the shooter. He approaches Netan.]

     NETAN
     Well done. You saved my life. You'll be richly rewarded.

     VENTRELL
     I know I will. But not for saving you.

   [Ventrell takes aim at an angry Netan.]

   EXT--FRONT YARD OF MITCHELL'S FAMILY HOME, DAY

   [Vala, now dressed in more modest clothing, is talking to Frank
   Mitchell who is standing, using his crutches. In the adjacent field are
   Mitchell and Amy, leaning against hay bales and chatting.]

     VALA

     (to Frank Mitchell)
     Thank you.

   [She and Frank hug. Wendy Mitchell comes rushing out of the house
   carrying a large plastic pie container.]

     WENDY MITCHELL

     (holding it toward Vala)
     Vala, you sure you don't want some pie for the road?

     VALA

     (rubbing her tummy)
     I couldn't possibly.

     WENDY MITCHELL
     It's your favorite.

   [Wendy hands the pie to Vala, along with napkins and forks.]

     VALA

     (rather wistful)
     Thank you. Well, the General will probably blame me if we miss our
     plane, so we probably should get moving.
     (calling to Mitchell)
     Cameron! We have to get moving!

     MITCHELL

     (very dismissively)
     Go wait in the car!

   [Frank and Wendy give Vala a confused look.]

     VALA
     I exaggerated the spiritual bond thing just a little.

     FRANK MITCHELL
     Yeah. Yeah, we got that.

     VALA
     Thank you.

   [She and Wendy embrace, kissing each other on the cheek.]

     VALA

     Bye.
     (to Mitchell, harshly)
     Move it!!

   [Nearby, Mitchell and Amy continue talking.]

     AMY
     To be honest with you, Cam, I don't know what to make of all this.
     Those Air Force people who made us all sign those papers were pretty
     scary. I'm not sure I'm allowed to even think about what happened,
     let alone talk about it.

     MITCHELL
     It's better this way. People who do talk about it just end up
     looking crazy. There's never any proof. And there is always
     plausible denial.

     AMY
     So you've...done this sort of thing before?

     MITCHELL
     I'm just sayin'...

     AMY
     I know. You can't talk about it. You can't even tell me what was
     really going on the other night. I do know this much. That man was
     trying to kill you...and your friends. Whatever it is you do, it's
     obviously dangerous.

     MITCHELL
     It's a job... It has to be done... And that's all I'm gonna say
     about that.

     AMY
     Well, if anybody has to be out there protecting us...from things
     we're not allowed to know about...I'm glad it's someone like you.

   [They kiss passionately for a few moments, until Vala honks the car
   horn once, then several more times.]

     MITCHELL

     (slightly nervous)
     You know, Colorado Springs, it's uh, not that far away, so maybe
     someday soon, you might think about taking a little trip.

     AMY

     (nodding)
     Maybe.

   [Mitchell gets into the driver's seat of the car.]

     MITCHELL
     She's a nice girl. I like her.

     VALA
     Nice? She's a cure for insomnia!

   [Vala feeds him a bite of pie.]

     MITCHELL
     Well we can't all make the brilliant decisions you've made.

     VALA
     Huh!

   [They start driving away as Amy and Mitchell's parents wave.]

     MITCHELL
     How many times have you been married, anyway?

     VALA
     Legally? Hmmm, well, it's hard to keep track. Let's see. The first
     one was a part of a band of traveling entertainers. He was a good
     cook, too. Couldn't make pie though.

     MITCHELL
     You know, forget it. Forget I asked.

   FADE OUT
