   PREVIOUSLY, ON STARGATE SG-1

   EXT--EARTH

   [Scene from "Prometheus" Season 6. The X-303, Prometheus rises above
   the ground, watched by three guards, who are completely dwarfed by the
   huge ship. O'Neill watches from a tent in the distance.]

     CARTER
     This is the Prometheus, otherwise known as the X-303.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Scene from "Memento" Season 6. The X-303 leaves hyperspace and enters
   orbit around an alien planet.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Gant and Carter look at the computer screen monitoring the engines.]

     GANT
     Sir, computers are detecting a rapid energy build up in the
     naquadriah cells.

     CARTER
     The jump must have triggered a power surge that overloaded the
     reactor control systems.

     RONSON
     Stand by to jettison the reactor module!

   EXT--SPACE

   [The reactor module exits from the side of the ship. Prometheus speeds
   away as the reactor explodes above the planets surface.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Ronson and SG-1 discuss their options.]

     RONSON
     Even if we were to plot a course for Earth using maximum sub-light
     thrust, it would take years.

   EXT--P3X-744

   [The Prometheus lands on the planet's surface.]

     JONAS

     (Off camera)
     P3X-744. If we could make it there and gate home, we could get what
     we need to repair the ship.

   FADE OUT

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   [The Prometheus speeds through a hyperspace window.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Elevator doors open to reveal Carter and Ronson in discussion. They
   leave the elevator and walk down the hallway.]

     RONSON
     So this thing's different from a nebula, how?

     CARTER
     Well, that's what makes it so exciting, Sir, we don't know exactly.

     RONSON
     And it just so happens that this formation is in the vicinity of our
     next cool down co-ordinates.

     CARTER
     It'll only be a little bit out of our way, Colonel, I promise. All I
     ask is 2 hours tops.

     RONSON
     If only so I can see the expression on your face first hand, the
     words kid and candy store come to mind.

   [Carter smiles.]

     CARTER
     I'll train to retain my composure, Sir.

     RONSON
     Just keep in mind that our mission is to get this bird home in one
     piece.

   [Carter nods.]

     INTERCOM
     Colonel Ronson, report to the bridge.

     RONSON
     Must be time.

   [Carter smiles and nods.]

     RONSON
     After you, Major.

   [He gestures for her to go first. They enter the bridge, and Ronson
   takes his seat in the middle of the bridge. Carter goes to the back of
   the bridge. Crewmen sit to each side of Ronson, one handling the
   navigation console, the other weapons. Several other personnel are
   scattered around the bridge, attending to their own duties.]

     GANT
     Sir, the hyperdrive engines are reaching maximum safe temperature.

     RONSON
     Shut 'em down, Major Gant.

     GANT
     Yes Sir, dropping out of hyperspace.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus exits a hyperspace window.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter is standing in front of a large Perspex screen which displays a
   star chart. Ronson comes to join her.]

     RONSON
     Major Carter, what's our progress?

     CARTER
     Well, Sir, we covered 49 light years in the last leg. Considering
     the hyperdrive we're using was lifted from an Al'kesh, I'd say
     that's pretty good.

   [He nods]

     CARTER
     It was originally designed for a ship one tenth this size.

     RONSON
     Only five more of these pit stops and we're home.

   [Carter nods and smiles. An alarm starts to sound which catches both
   their attentions.]

     GANT
     Colonel, a boogie just appeared on our sensors. Dead ahead, three
     thousand clicks.

     RONSON
     Can you identify it?

     GANT
     Negative, Sir. It's closing in on our position very quickly.

   [Ronson re-takes his chair.]

     RONSON
     Sound general quarters.

   [The lights dim, and a klaxon starts to sound. Major Gant's radar
   screen shows the ship closing in on the Prometheus.]

     GANT
     Boogie is now at two thousand clicks.

     RONSON
     Raise shields, arm weapons.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A ship, which looks vastly superior in size and technology, approaches
   the Prometheus.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Lights are dimmed ready for battle. Several staff check their
   instruments. Ronson sits in his chair, checking his readout, as Carter
   stands next to him, looking out of the windscreen, looking for the
   boogie.]

     GANT
     Boogie is now at 900 clicks. It's not slowing down, Sir.

     RONSON
     How long 'til we can jump to hyperspace again?

     CARTER
     The hyperdrive needs at least two hours to cool down before we can
     attempt another jump. If we try one before that it could overload.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A huge, much more advanced looking ship nears the Prometheus.]

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Colonel, I'm getting some unusual readings coming from the alien
     vessel.

   [Carter hurries to his station to investigate.]

     CARTER
     They're scanning us, Sir.

     RONSON
     Major Gant, set up a wide frequency broadcast, I want to talk to
     them.

   [Gant presses a few buttons.]

     GANT
     Go ahead, Sir.

     RONSON
     This is Colonel William Ronson, commander of the Prometheus. Please,
     respond.

   [Static is heard over the intercom.]

     RONSON
     If you can hear me, I offer you peaceful greetings.

   [Static is again heard.]

     GANT
     Boogie is at 400 clicks and is continuing to gain on our position,
     Sir.

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Sir, thermographic sensors are showing a rapid build up of energy
     coming from within the ship.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The sides of the alien ship expand and curl round to form a crescent
   on wither side of the main body. Canons appear from these wings.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Energy build up is continuing, Sir.

     CARTER
     They're powering up weapons. Colonel, we have to get out of here.

     RONSON
     Major Gant, Initiate evasion manoeuvre delta now.

     GANT
     Yes Sir, executing delta.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Prometheus begins to move away to the right, it's port side facing the
   alien vessel. As it moves away, the alien ship fires at it, hitting the
   shields at the rear of the Prometheus. It pursues the Prometheus,
   continuing to fire. Prometheus heads into the gaseous nebula Carter had
   wanted to look at earlier.]

   INT--PROEMTHEUS BRIDGE

   [The bridge shudders from the impact of weapons fire, and a few panels
   blow. Carter, still standing by the weapons officer's chair, has to
   hold on to it to steady herself. An alarm sounds in the background.]

     RONSON
     Major Gant, report.

     GANT
     Shields down 69%, weapons are draining our shields.

   [Their faces are suddenly illuminated by incoming fire. The bridge
   shakes again.]

     GANT
     53 percent.

     RONSON
     Apply auxiliary power to shield generators, weapons officer, prepare
     to return fire on my command.

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Aft missile bays 1 through 6 loaded and ready, Sir.

     RONSON
     Fire one through four, now!

   [The weapons officer complies.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Four missiles leave the Prometheus, but are almost immediately
   destroyed by the alien vessel.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Sir, missiles destroyed before reaching the target.

   [Ronson looks a little stunned, and the ship is again rocked by
   incoming fire. More panels explode in the background.]

     GANT
     Alien vessel is still gaining on us, Sir, shield strength is
     at...32%.

     RONSON
     Fire all missiles, at will.

   [Carter looks round.]

     CARTER
     Wait. Suggest diverting auxiliary power back to the sub-light
     engines.

     RONSON
     Major?

     CARTER
     The gas cloud. If we can get inside it, it might make it harder for
     them to track us.

   [Ronson looks at Carter, then out the windscreen, where the gas cloud
   looms large. They are rocked by another batch of fire.]

     GANT
     Shields below 15 percent.

     RONSON
     Even with sub-light engines on full strength, we'll never make it.

     CARTER
     It might be possible to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud.
     Just give me a few minutes to over ride the safeguards.

     RONSON
     You have two.

   [She nods, and runs to the engine room. Another blast rocks the ship.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter runs in, and starts furiously typing at a control panel. There
   is an explosion in the background, and sparks fly. Carter looks briefly
   at it, then returns to the job in hand. Again the ship is hit.]

     CARTER
     Come on, one jump.

   [Carter grimaces, then runs out of the room. The main computer screen
   in the engine room reads override request denied.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus draws nearer to the gas cloud, be fired upon all the
   way by the alien vessel, which draws ever nearer.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

     WEAPONS OFFICER
     Sir, weapons systems are no longer operational.

     GANT
     Shields are below 10 percent. Receiving ship-wide damage reports,
     Colonel.

   [Ronson looks unsure of what to do.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE ROOM.

   [Carter enters the engine room. She pulls out one of the drawers
   containing engine crystals. She presses some buttons on the side, when
   the crystals flash and a surge of energy is released, throwing her
   sideways onto the opposite wall. She hits her head, and slides to the
   floor, unconscious.]

   FADE OUT

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE ROOM

   [Carter comes to. She has a small gash on her forehead, near her
   hairline. She is obviously concussed, and slowly stands up, using the
   wall for support. She walks out the engine room, groggily, still
   leaning heavily on the wall for support. She grabs the nearest intercom
   phone on the wall.]

     CARTER
     This is Major Carter calling the bridge.

   [There is no answer]

     CARTER
     Bridge, please respond!

   [All remains quiet. Carter turns around, and sees a small girl, dressed
   in a white sleeveless dress, white ankle socks and white shoes. She has
   long curly blond hair. She smiles at Carter. Carter blinks and the
   child disappears. Carter thinks for a moment, then replaces the phone,
   and goes in the direction of the girl. She is still very wobbly on her
   feet. Carter walks around the corridors, and into the mess. It is
   deserted, with half eaten meals still on the table. She pauses for a
   moment, surveying the scene, then heads off down the corridor again.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter enters the bridge to find it deserted, like the rest of the
   ship she has seen so far. Out of the front windows the nebula can be
   seen. She goes to the commander's chair, and activates the ship-wide
   intercom.]

     CARTER

     This is the bridge, calling all decks.
     (pause)
     Please respond.

   [Carter goes to one of the panels, and activates the internal security
   cameras. Looking at them, she sees that the ship is totally deserted.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus is still inside the nebula.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter is surveying the ship's systems, from Major Gant's chair.]

     CARTER
     This is Major Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force vessel
     Prometheus. As the sole remaining crew member of this ship I feel
     compelled to keep a log of these events. After being attacked by a
     hostile alien ship, I sustained an injury and lost consciousness.
     When I awoke, I found the ship devoid of all crew. An initial
     systems review indicated the hyper-drive to be operational, but the
     sub-light engines remain offline, possibly due to damage from the
     attack. I am hopeful further investigation will provide more
     answers.

   [The screen Carter is looking at flashes the same message, "sub-light
   engines offline". She tries to restart them, but is greeted with the
   message "error, restart command not available."]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Carter travels in an elevator to the engine room to try and solve the
   problem.]

     CARTER
     However, my first priority is to find out what happened to the crew.

   [She exits the elevator.]

     CARTER
     Having searched the entire ship and found no one, only one
     possibility remains to explain their disappearance.

   [She walks into the engine control room, and goes to the computer. She
   checks the status of the escape pods, and finds that there are no
   escape pods on board, they have all been jettisoned.]

     CARTER
     Based on the fact that all the escape pods have been jettisoned, I
     can only assume an evacuation order was given after my losing
     consciousness. In the chaos that must have ensued, I was left
     behind.

   [She sits at the engine controls, and tries to restart the engines.
   They begin, to fire up, but then a warning sign flashes on the
   monitors, and they power down.]

     CARTER
     The sub-light engines remain offline. I'm guessing something about
     the gas loud is inhibiting the restart procedures. Thus far I have
     been unable to find a way around this problem.

   [Error messages come up on her screen.]

     CARTER
     Without sub-light engine power to manoeuvre the ship out of the
     cloud I'm left with only one other option.

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter sits in Major Gant's chair. She presses some buttons, and
   starts to activate a hyperspace window. It starts to appear outside the
   ship, but then collapses in on itself. The monitor shows the message
   "hyperdrive window failure. Overload imminent." Carter hangs her head
   in disappointment, then shuts down the hyperdrive engine. She sighs.]

     CARTER
     Dammit.

   [She leans her head on her hand, but her arm is gripped by another.
   Turning round, she sees Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter.

   [Carter looks exhausted, and dazed.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Hear me. You must remain conscious at all cost.

     CARTER

     (closing her eyes)
     I just need to rest for a while.

     TEAL'C

     (forcefully)
     You cannot!

   [She starts awake a little, then starts dropping off again.]

     TEAL'C
     Listen to me! You are injured. If you sleep, you will die. Do you
     understand?

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     I know.

   [She starts to nod off again, but is startled by Teal'c's voice once
   more.

     TEAL'C

     (slowly and forcefully)
     If you sleep, you will die!

   [Carter looks at Teal'c, frowning slightly, then closes her eyes.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus still lingers in the nebula.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter is at Gant's station, head leant over and resting on her arms.
   She has fallen asleep. A young girl's voice is heard singing "Twinkle
   Twinkle Little Star." Carter raises her head, she can hear the singing.
   She turns and looks towards the corridor, the singing seems to be
   coming from there. Footsteps can be heard as well.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR

   [Carter follows the voice, which is still singing twinkle twinkle. The
   singing pauses momentarily.]

     CARTER
     Someone there?

   [The singing resumes. Carter stops at a corridor junction, and looks
   down each of the passageways.]

     CARTER
     Hello?

   [The singing gets fainter, then stops. Carter closes her eyes briefly,
   still feeling the effects of her concussion. She begins to walk away.]

     CARTER
     Okay.

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter is sitting again in Gant's chair. The screen in front of her
   shows the status of a distress beacon.]

     CARTER
     I have sent out a distress signal detailing Prometheus' situation
     and our last known position in space. I know it could be hundreds of
     years before anyone hears it.

   INT--PROMETHEUS BATHROOM

   [Carter walks in and takes the first aid box off the wall.]

     CARTER
     That said, Stargate Command was aware of our route home, and will
     undoubtedly do everything they can to mount a rescue.

   [She treats her head wound.]

     CARTER
     And, if any of the crew survived, I can only hope they will
     eventually send help as well.

   INT-- PROMETHEUS SUPLLY ROOM

   [Carter is surrounded by boxes. She is taking an inventory of
   supplies.]

     CARTER
     Therefore, I feel my best course of action is to settle in for the
     long haul.

   INT--PROMETHEUS MESS

   [Carter is filling plastic bags with different foods to create complete
   meals.]

     CARTER
     According to my calculations I have enough food and water to last
     several months.

   [She places the bag in a box, and carries the box over to the other
   sides of the room, where there are several other boxes, as also packed
   with food.]

     CARTER
     With further rationing, it might be possible to double that.

   [Carter looks as if she feels dizzy again, and bends over, leaning on
   the table for support. The child stands in the doorway.]

     GRACE
     Play with me.

   [Carter looks over at her, but doesn't answer. She looks down, and when
   she looks back up, the child has disappeared again.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is writing something.]

     CARTER
     I've been trying to understand why the ship has been unable to jump
     into hyperspace. During my last jump attempt the hyperspace window
     seemed unable to stabilise enough for the ship to enter it.

   [She nibbles on a power bar.]

     CARTER
     Thus far sensors have been unable to identify the actual content of
     the cloud itself. It's more likely made up of a denser group of
     gases than that of a typical nebula or gas giant. Bottom line is,
     it's preventing the hyperdrive emitters from transferring power at
     an even rate. Until that changes, the Prometheus will remain trapped
     here, indefinitely.

   [She takes another bite of the power bar, but nearly chokes on it as
   she hears a familiar voice.]

     DANIEL
     Yep, I'd say you're stuck alright.

   [She looks behind her to see Daniel, leaning back on a chair. He looks
   at her, and she looks round again, unable to believe her eyes.]

     DANIEL
     Oh come on, Sam, you've been running the same diagnostic program for
     four hours now, what makes you think the results are suddenly going
     to change?

   [She ignores him, and continues writing. Daniel looks round at her when
   she doesn't respond.]

     DANIEL
     Sa-am, Hello-o!

   [He snaps his fingers at her, trying to get her attention.]

     CARTER
     Were you this annoying when you were ascended?

     DANIEL
     I dunno, depends on who you ask. I thought I had a certain je ne
     sais qua. Timing was so-so.

   [She turns round to face him.]

     CARTER
     No offence, but I really don't have time for this.

   [Daniel just stares at her.]

     CARTER
     This is ridiculous, you aren't even real.

   [She turns back to her work.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I'm not so much me, as I am...you, really. Part of your
     subconscious mind. So, am I real? That's up to you, I guess.
     Although the Socratic implications are quite fascinating.

     CARTER
     Daniel...

     DANIEL
     Look, you just need some help, that's all. Can't you just try to go
     along with this?

   [Carter turns back round to him.]

     CARTER
     You're me, talking to me.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, basically.

     CARTER

     (Resigned)
     Alright, you have a point. I could use some help.

   [Daniel claps his hands, and jumps out of his seat.]

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

   [He comes and sits down next to her.]

     CARTER
     Okay, what do you...I want?

     DANIEL
     Well, I think you're going about this all wrong.

     CARTER
     This is helping?

     DANIEL
     Come on, Sam, you've been looking forward to studying this cloud for
     weeks now. I mean, that's the real reason you volunteered for this
     job in the first place. Now you're here, finally here, and, and
     you're wasting your time running endless hyperdrive simulations.

     CARTER
     In case you hadn't noticed, I've got a small problem on my hands,
     Daniel. Mainly that I'm stranded.

     DANIEL

     Inside the very thing you've been looking at through a telescope for
     years.
     (Excited and animated)
     Come on, it's a chance to see something rare and exciting up close!
     Seize the moment!

     CARTER
     Seize the moment?

     DANIEL

     I'm just saying it's, it's, it's new, something we've never
     encountered before...
     (calmer, quieter)
     ...and you're ignoring it. Does that sound like you?

   [Carter pauses, unsure of what to say.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, I can't even think straight, let alone stay awake.

   [Daniel walks round, and stands behind her chair.]

     DANIEL
     Sam, you have to check this out. Trust me, it's important.

   [She considers his words, and continues working. Daniel has gone.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Carter is boxing up more food in the mess. She is disturbed by some
   strange sounds, like metal being strained to breaking point. She
   carries a box down the corridor, but stops when she hears the sounds
   again, and stops, concerned.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS CONTROL ROOM

   [A monitor shows that 4 sections of the outer hull have suffered
   structural damage, and had their integrity compromised.]

     CARTER
     Oh, my God.

   [The monitor shows the estimated time for inner hull breach to be 8
   hours, 3 minutes and 26 seconds.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR.

   [O'Neill waits for an elevator. One arrives, and he gets in. As the
   doors close, Daniel slips in. They stand side by side as the elevator
   ascends.]

     DANIEL
     You, uh, hear about Sam?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     Doesn't sound good.

     O'NEILL
     18 hours past due for contact, yeah I'd say something went wrong.

   [There is a moment of uncomfortable silence.]

     DANIEL
     Well, anyway I put together a list of planets with Stargates on in
     range of the Prometheus' route. General Hammond agreed to send SG
     teams to all of them, including us.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     DANIEL
     Well, if something went wrong, then there's a chance they could make
     it to a planet with a gate.

     O'NEILL
     At which time they would gate home, wouldn't they?

     DANIEL
     Well, when the hyperdrive failed on the Prometheus' maiden voyage
     you were nearly stranded on P7X-009 because they didn't know where
     the Stargate was.

     O'NEILL
     Sounds like a long shot.

   [Daniel looks a little confused at O'Neill's reaction.]

     DANIEL
     Well, unfortunately the Tok'ra are unable to send a ship at this
     time. They've promised to retrace the route of the Prometheus as
     soon as they can, but you know, visiting these planets is...

     O'NEILL
     What? Is what?

   [The elevator stops. Daniel suddenly realises something.]

     DANIEL
     Is something.

   [The elevator doors open. O'Neill looks at Daniel for a long moment.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [He walks out the elevator, frowning. Daniel watches him leave, mulling
   things over.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus remains trapped in the nebula.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter sits at the engine control desk.]

     CARTER
     Ship's log update. I have discovered that several sections of the
     hull are being corroded by the gases that make up this cloud.
     Although I have boosted whatever power I can to our shields, it has
     had little effect on protecting the ship.

   [She watches the monitor, which shows several sections now in critical
   danger.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Carter is in one of the corridors. She presses a button on one side of
   a door, which closes and seals that section off.]

     CARTER
     I sealed off those sections affected by the corrosion, but it's only
     a stop gap measure. All I know for certain is, if I can't find a way
     to stop it from spreading, the ship's hull will eventually be
     breached.

   [Carter swipes her passcard to open another set of doors. She grabs the
   wall as another wave of dizziness comes over her. A child's voice grabs
   her attention.]

     GRACE
     When the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon.

   [The child walks towards her, stops and smiles.]

     CARTER
     Who are you? What do you want?

     GRACE
     Then you show you're little light, twinkle twinkle all the night.
     Come on, this way.

   [She walks down a corridor, and Carter follows.]

     CARTER
     Wait!

   [The girl speeds up, round a corner and out of Carter's view. Carter
   hurries round the corner, but meets Teal'c instead, smiling at her.]

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     Samantha.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, did you see...course you didn't.

     TEAL'C

     (gently)
     I'm here to warn you.

     CARTER
     I know, I've got to stay awake.

     TEAL'C

     (still smiling)
     That's not all.
     (looking around)
     Everything may not be as it seems.

     CARTER
     Well, thank you. But the fact that I'm talking to someone who's not
     really here kinda speaks to that.

     TEAL'C
     On the contrary, I think it's you that's not here.

     CARTER
     What are you talking about?

     TEAL'C
     I believe that you and the other crew members are being held
     prisoners aboard the alien vessel that attacked you.

     CARTER
     How do you know?

     TEAL'C
     It is possible they are probing your mind. If so, any information
     obtained may be used to attack Earth.

     CARTER
     Okay, hold on. Even if you're right, and I'm not really here, what
     am I supposed to do about it?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, give me something here.

     TEAL'C
     Very well, as you attempt to repair the ship's engines, you may
     inadvertently be divulging to your captors vital information
     concerning Prometheus technology. I do believe it would be prudent
     to do nothing.

     CARTER
     I can't do that, Teal'c.

   [Teal'c nods and starts to walk away.]

     TEAL'C
     Be careful, Samantha.

     CARTER

     Wait, where are you going?
     (pause)
     You're wrong, Teal'c, I'm not on an alien ship, I'm right here.

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Carter lies on the ground, eyes closed. She wakes up, as a door behind
   her opens.]

     CARTER

     (quietly)
     This is real.

   [She rolls over, and tries to get up. She touches her head, in obvious
   pain.]

     CARTER
     Ow, this is real.

   [She makes her way up off the floor, and heads down the corridor,
   leaning on the wall heavily for support. The door closes behind her.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter sits in the commander's chair.]

     CARTER
     The effects of my head injury are getting worse. I'm not sure how
     much longer I can last. My only hope of survival is to somehow get
     the Prometheus free of this gas cloud without using either the
     sub-light or hyper-drive engines. I think I've come up with a way.
     It has its risks.

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Alarm claxons sound. Doors close all over the ship. Carter is still
   sitting in the commander's chair, but she straps herself in.]

     CARTER
     By venting several levels worth of pressurised atmosphere I am
     hoping to generate enough propulsion to move the ship.

   [A monitor shows "Venting sequence initiated. Airlock three open."]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Several doors on the side on the Prometheus open, and air streams
   out.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Air streams through the Prometheus, being sucked into space. On the
   bridge Carter watches, and listens to the sounds of the hull under
   great stress due to the venting. She watches the process closely.]

     CARTER
     Come on.

   [Carter looks up at one of the internal security cameras, and sees the
   little girl, holding on to one of the support struts in a corridor that
   is undergoing venting. Although there is no sound, the child is clearly
   saying "help me." She is swept away.]

     CARTER
     No!

   [She unfastens herself, and closes the shuts down the venting.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Carter runs to rescue the girl. However, her head injury is still
   affecting her, and she has to steady herself.]

     CARTER
     Hello? Are you here?

   [She continues to move through the corridor, steadying herself as she
   goes.]

     DANIEL

     (from behind her)
     Hey! Have I ,uh, told you my latest theory yet, it's really cool.

   [Carter looks around for a moment, and Daniel looks around too.]

     DANIEL
     Lose something?

     CARTER
     Did you see a...

     DANIEL
     Little girl?

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     No.

   [Carter sighs, and keeps going, in search on the girl. Daniel follows
   her.]

     DANIEL
     You know, you don't look so good.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     Now, my theory. What if this cloud isn't so much a collection of
     corrosive gases, so much as it is a sentient being. I'm saying the
     cloud is alive, Sam.

   [She stops and turns around to face him.]

     CARTER
     The cloud is alive?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it's a sentient being, like, uh, feelings, memories, space
     born alien entity if you will.

   [He smiles, looking very pleased at the last remark.]

     CARTER
     That's crazy.

     DANIEL
     Well, why else would it be corroding the ship?

     CARTER
     Because the gases are corrosive.

     DANIEL
     Or, maybe we somehow offended it when we flew inside of it. The
     point is, if we talk to it, maybe it will let us go.

   [Carter is looking increasingly dazed, as if she is having trouble
   focusing.]

     CARTER
     You want me to talk to the cloud.

     DANIEL
     Would it kill you to try?

     CARTER
     And how would I do that?

     DANIEL
     Well, you said there was this little girl running round the ship.
     Maybe that little girl is the physical personification of the cloud.

   [Carter leans back against the wall, and almost falls to the ground.
   She is looking increasingly fragile.]

     DANIEL
     No, no just go with me on this, maybe that's its way of trying to
     communicate with us.

   [Carter is now trying to keep herself from falling unconscious, but is
   getting nearer and nearer the floor.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, this isn't helping.

   [She slumps to the floor, losing consciousness.]

     DANIEL
     Talk to her, Sam.

   [Carter lies on the floor, unconscious. The girl can be heard singing
   twinkle twinkle. her singing and footsteps get louder and louder,
   coming nearer to Carter. Carter opens her eyes, and sits up, turning
   towards the girl, who is now standing beside her.]

     CARTER
     My mother used to sing that to me.

     GRACE
     How obscure.

     CARTER
     I'm so tired.

     GRACE
     You can't sleep, not yet.

     CARTER
     Why?

     GRACE
     Because we need to talk.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus remains trapped.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS MESS.

   [Carter sits at the mess table. It has been cleared, except for a
   serviette dispenser and sugar pourer. She holds her head in one hand.
   The girl brings over a bowl of fruit and places it before Carter.]

     GRACE
     Eat. You need to keep your strength up.

     CARTER
     Do you have a name?

     GRACE

     (smiling)
     I'm Grace.

     CARTER
     Who are you?

     GRACE
     You know.

     CARTER
     No, I don't know.

     JACOB
     I'm your father.

   [Carter looks up to see Jacob standing at the other end of the table.
   Grace has disappeared.]

     CARTER
     Dad?

   [Jacob walks down the table.]

     JACOB
     I know it sounds corny, but you get to an age...

   [He sits down]

     JACOB
     You get to an age where you think about everything you did wrong as
     a parent.

   [Carter leans her head back on her hands, but still looks at her
   father.]

     JACOB
     Don't take this the wrong way...

     CARTER
     I know. I don't look so good.

   [Jacob smiles and shakes his head.]

     JACOB
     I wanted so many things for you, Sam. And look what it's brought you
     instead.

     CARTER
     Sure, but the massive headache really takes the edge off it all.

     JACOB
     Are you happy, Sam?

     CARTER
     What?

     JACOB
     Just answer the question.

     CARTER
     Well, at the moment things are a little rough, but, in general,
     sure, I'm happy.

     JACOB
     No, you're not. You're content, you're satisfied. You're in control.
     And that's the problem.

     CARTER
     Okay, I'm really not following here.

     JACOB
     I'm saying, you're missing something vital from your life. And the
     sad part is you have no idea what I'm talking about.

     CARTER
     Dad, I am happy. I've seen and done things most people couldn't even
     dream of. I have an incredible life.

     JACOB
     And yet you're alone.

     CARTER
     Well, lately the dating scene been a little stale, but then again I
     am marooned on a spaceship.

     JACOB
     No. Always. For as long as she was alive, your mother showed me a
     world beyond just ambition and career. She gave my life meaning, and
     balance. And it was my honour to love her for the short time she was
     with me.

   [Carter looks increasingly upset.]

     JACOB
     And if I were young again, and I met her for the first time, even
     knowing her fate, I would do it all over again. That is love.

   [There is a pause, as Carter tries to gather herself together.]

     JACOB
     Sam? I know you have denied yourself the experience because you
     think that it must inevitably end in pain, and loneliness,

   [Carter is openly crying now, and cannot answer. She gently shakes her
   head. Jacob reaches over and takes her hand in his.]

     JACOB
     It's time to let go of the things that prevent you from finding
     happiness. you deserve to love someone, and be loved in return.

   [Carter looks at him, but he disappears, and she is left alone at the
   table again.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Alarms sound indicating an incoming wormhole. SG-1 walk down the ramp,
   met by Hammond at the bottom.]

     HAMMOND
     Report, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     This one was a bust too, Sir. In fact, these folks were more in the
     dark than the first bunch.

     TEAL'C
     They were indeed a primitive society.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, whatever. They hadn't seen any sign of the ship. we're 0 for 7
     Sir.

     DANIEL
     Have you heard from the Tok'ra?

     HAMMOND
     They've completed an initial trace of the Prometheus' route. there's
     no sign of it at any of the designated cool down co-ordinates.

     O'NEILL
     You're assuming they stayed on course.

     HAMMOND
     They're currently expanding their search, conducting long range
     scans of several systems adjacent to the route home. Hopefully we'll
     hear something from them soon.

   [O'Neill opens his mouth to say something, then thinks differently and
   walks out of the gate room.]

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [O'Neill stands in front of his locker. He slams down his cap, and
   starts to get changed. Teal'c enters the room.]

     O'NEILL
     I don't wanna hear it.

   [Teal'c remains silent.]

     O'NEILL

     (glancing over his shoulder)
     Good. 'Cause I'm not in the mood.

   [Teal'c remains silent. O'Neill turns round to face Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Alright, what?

     TEAL'C
     When Colonel Maybourne and yourself were stranded off world, Major
     Carter felt a similar sense of frustration. She despaired at the
     thought of never seeing you again.

   [O'Neill takes this in for a moment.]

     O'NEILL
     Not you?

     TEAL'C

     (quietly)
     Indeed. You are like a brother to me, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     You're like, what, 130?

     TEAL'C
     A younger brother, perhaps. But that is not my point.

     O'NEILL
     Look, T, I know what you're trying to do.

   [He turns back to face his locker.]

     O'NEILL
     And I appreciate it.

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Bubbles float down from somewhere above. Carter sits on the floor of
   the bridge, watching Grace blow bubbles. She smiles, resignedly.]

     GRACE
     Wanna try?

   [Carter shakes her head.]

     GRACE
     It's fun.

     CARTER
     I remember when I was a little girl I used to wonder how a bubble
     could exist. You see there's this thing called surface tension, when
     molecules bind together in a certain way...

     GRACE
     Boring!

   [She walks over to Carter, and holds the bubble wand up for Carter to
   blow through.]

     GRACE
     Here, just try it.

   [Carter takes the wand and blows a stream of bubbles.]

     GRACE
     See. Fun.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Alright Carter, come on, on your feet, let's go.

   [O'Neill stand in the doorway, covered in shadow.]

     CARTER
     I was wondering when you were going to show up.

     O'NEILL
     You just gonna sit there?

     CARTER
     Too tired, Sir.

   [O'Neill walks into the room, and sits opposite her, on the floor.]

     O'NEILL
     Samantha, I'm a figment of your imagination, you're gonna call me
     Sir?

     CARTER
     Old habits, sorry.

     O'NEILL
     So, you gonna save yourself, or what?

     CARTER
     I'm tired.

     O'NEILL
     Just given up then?

     CARTER
     I just don't know what to do right now.

     O'NEILL
     You'll think of something.

     CARTER
     Came to give me a pep talk?

     O'NEILL
     It's what friends are for.

     CARTER
     Friends.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, this is you talking here. Might as well be honest.

     CARTER
     What if I quit the air force? Would that change anything or is it
     just an excuse?

     O'NEILL
     I would never ask you to give up your career.

     CARTER
     Because you don't feel anything for me?

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     I'd let you go right now if I knew.

     O'NEILL
     That easy?

     CARTER
     I didn't say it would be easy.

     O'NEILL
     Then what's stopping you? If you really want to know.

     CARTER
     I'm trying.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe it's not me that's the problem here. Let's face it, I'm not
     that complex.

     CARTER
     Me?

     O'NEILL
     Sam, I'm a safe bet.

     CARTER
     As long as I'm thinking about you, setting my sights on what I think
     is unattainable, there's no chance of being hurt by someone else.

     O'NEILL
     Jacob was right. You deserve more. I will always be there for you,
     no matter what. Believe me.

     CARTER

     (a little choked up)
     So what now?

     O'NEILL
     Go save your ass.

     CARTER
     One last thing.

   [She imagines them kissing. O'Neill waits for the request.]

     CARTER
     Never mind.

   [The ship suddenly shakes, as part of the hull breaches. Carter goes to
   investigate, leaving O'Neill still sitting there.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS

   [Alarms sound as Carter enters the bridge. Gant's monitors shows that
   an inner hull breach is imminent. Carter looks over and sees Grace,
   still playing with her bubbles. Sparks start to fly as electrical
   circuits overload.]

     CARTER
     What do you want?

     GRACE
     What do you mean?

     CARTER
     Whoever you are, I know why everyone else keeps showing up, why are
     you here? What do you want from me?

     GRACE
     I don't want anything, but you do. Then the traveller in the dark,
     thanks you for you tiny spark. How could he see where to go, if you
     did not twinkle so.

   [She keeps blowing her bubbles. Carter watches them, and suddenly
   realises something and runs away.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter sits at the operations desk, frantically typing something in.
   Grace watches her closely.]

     GRACE
     What you looking at?

     CARTER
     It's complicated.

     GRACE
     Try me.

     CARTER
     I'm going to try and save myself with a bubble.

     GRACE
     How?

     CARTER
     The hyper-drive won't fully engage because of the cloud, but maybe
     it doesn't have to. If I can dial down the power flow from the
     hyper-drive emitter, theoretically I should be able to create a
     partial shift into hyperspace, essentially taking the ship out of
     the cloud's space-time. Hopefully just enough to eliminate its
     effects on the sub-light engines.

     GRACE
     Neat.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

   [Carter swivels over to the engine controls, looks back over her
   shoulder, and finds grace has gone. Carter activates the hyper-drive.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus' engine fire up, and a blue bubble surrounds the ship.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter takes Gant's chair, and engages the sub-light engines.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus' sub-light engines power into life, and Prometheus
   starts to move forward, toward the alien vessel.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Alarms still blare as Carter sees the alien ship ahead of her. Daniel
   walks up to her.]

     DANIEL
     Sam, what are you doing?

   [Carter ignores him]

     TEAL'C
     I believe she is attempting to rescue her fellow crew members.

   [Both he and O'Neill have joined Daniel at Carter's side.]

     DANIEL
     What, what from them, that's crazy. Get back to Earth, and then
     bring in the cavalry.

     CARTER
     There's no time.

     TEAL'C
     I agree. the alien vessel is too formidable.

     O'NEILL
     Will you guys shut up, just let her work.

   [Daniel and Teal'c both shoot looks at O'Neill.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Prometheus faces the alien vessel, which dwarfs the Prometheus.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter now takes the commander's chair. She switches on the
   communication channels.]

     CARTER
     This is Major Samantha Carter of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.
     Can you hear me?

   [She waits a few moments for a response. There seems to be nothing but
   static. She tries again.]

     CARTER
     I'm thinking you've been stuck in here just as long as I have. The
     only difference is, I've found a way out.

   [Again, there is only static on response.]

     CARTER
     Here's the deal, return my crew, everyone, in tact and let us go.
     And I'll help you get out of here. Do we have a deal?

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two ships face each other.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [Carter waits anxiously for a response. Suddenly the bridge crew are
   beamed onto the bridge. Other members of the crew are also beamed back,
   approximately the same location from where they were taken.]

     RONSON
     What the hell just happened?

   [Carter vacates the commander's chair, and gets into Gant's.]

     CARTER
     It's a long story, Sir. Just bear with me. I'm activating a
     hyperspace bubble to include the alien vessel.

   [She presses some buttons. Gant leans over her shoulder, watching.]

     CARTER
     We're going to bring it with us, out of the cloud.

     RONSON
     Major?

     CARTER
     I'll explain everything soon enough, Sir.

   EXT--SPACE

   [First Prometheus, then the alien vessel, exit the gas cloud.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

     RONSON
     Now what?

     CARTER
     We see if they keep their end of the bargain.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The alien vessel moves over them, then away. Both Carter and Ronson
   take a sigh of relief.]

     RONSON
     Well done, Major.

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER
     Sir, with your permission I'd like to relieve myself of duty now.

     RONSON

     Easy.
     (to crew members)
     Get her to the infirmary.

   [Two crew members help Carter out of the chair and down the corridor.
   Ronson looks at Carter, then at the window, and shakes his head.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Monitors bleep quietly in the background. Carter lies asleep in a bed,
   with O'Neill looking on. Carter comes to, blinking a lot.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey.

     CARTER
     Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     CARTER

     (trying to focus)
     Sorry, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, well, a massive concussion will tend to...disorient one.

     CARTER
     How long was I out there?

     O'NEILL
     It's all relative Carter, that whole time-space continuum thing.

     CARTER
     Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Four days.

     CARTER
     Could have sworn it was weeks.

     O'NEILL
     Um, Teal'c and Daniel say hi, uh, they're planning a little bit of a
     shindig for when you're up and around. There's talk of cake.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     A cake?

     O'NEILL
     My idea.

     CARTER
     Can't wait.

     O'NEILL
     Need anything? Magazine, yo-yo?

     CARTER

     (shaking head)
     I'm fine.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, you are.

   [He turns to leave.]

     CARTER
     Thank you, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     For what?

     CARTER
     Nothing.

     O'NEILL
     Think nothing of it. I've got plenty of that.

   [They smile at each other, and he leaves. Carter closes her eyes.
   Grace's voice is heard singing again, and Carter opens her eyes to an
   empty infirmary. Carter smiles briefly, and closes her eyes again.]
