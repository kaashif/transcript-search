     MITCHELL

     (voiceover)
     So you're in the Ori galaxy.

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     Yes. Me carrying this child right now is a problem, a big problem,
     but believe me, there is one which is much, much bigger.

   [Vala looks down upon the Ori ships under construction.]

   INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM

     VALA
     The ships are planning to leave. Somewhere out there the Ori have a
     working Supergate.

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

     DANIEL
     Merlin was conducting research on some kind of new invention. A
     weapon capable of destroying Ascended Beings.

   [A Stargate address is visible amidst the Ancient writing.]

     CARTER
     I don't need to know Ancient to understand what that is.

     DANIEL
     A gate address to where he hid the weapon.

   EXCERPTS FROM 9.19 "CRUSADE PART 1"

     DANIEL
     Every ally we have and everyone else on this base has already
     devoted themselves to finding the Supergate.

   TEASER

   EXT--MERLIN'S PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1 walk along a path in a lightly wooded area.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, has anyone stopped to think how this thing might possibly work?
     I mean, how do you kill something that's pure energy?

     DANIEL
     Well, technically, Merlin's research didn't refer to killing. A
     better translation would be 'neutralizing' or 'canceling out'.

     MITCHELL
     Well it still begs a lot of questions. How do you aim at something
     you can't see?

     DANIEL
     Clearly it can't be a weapon in the conventional sense. See,
     Ascended Beings transcend ordinary space-time as we know it. This
     device would have to do the same thing.

     MITCHELL
     In other words, you have no idea what it might be.

     DANIEL

     (agreeing strongly)
     Yeah, pretty much, that's it.

     CARTER
     Well, this looks promising.

   [They have come upon a medieval village, made up of stone buildings set
   very close together, each with a chimney. The village is surrounded by
   a stone wall that has a gated entrance.]

   EXT--CAMELOT VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

   [SG-1 enter the village square from an outside gate. The ground is
   covered in thick mud. There are horses and various merchant stalls
   situated around the square. Colored flags are strung across the
   streets. The villagers react with alarm to the visitors, even though
   Teal'c is smiling at them.]

     CARTER
     Well, it certainly looks like a place where Merlin might have lived.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, I wouldn't get too excited just yet. There could be dozens of
     villages in the area just like this one. No way to know for sure
     this is the right one.

   [The villagers are gathered around, staring at SG-1 from a safe
   distance.]

     DANIEL

     (gesturing)
     Well, there's... that.

   [There is a sword standing straight up out of a large stone platform,
   its hilt and some of its blade visible. SG-1 walk toward it. A finely
   dressed man and several villagers approach from the other side of the
   stone.]

     MEURIK

     (smiling but nervous)
     Travelers. I am Meurik, Governor of this village. Welcome to
     Camelot.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--VILLAGE PUB

   [SG-1 are seated at a long wooden table, their rifles set on top of it.
   Meurik sits at the head of the table. A middle-aged man approaches.]

     ANTONIUS
     These must be the strangers that everyone is speaking of.

     MEURIK
     This is Antonius, our village historian.

     ANTONIUS
     Welcome to Camelot. Past and future home of King Arthur and his
     Round Table.

     CARTER
     Sorry, future home?

     MEURIK
     I assume you know the history of the Battle of Camlann.

     DANIEL
     Of course, where Arthur was mortally wounded by Mordred.

     MEURIK

     (incredulous, then chuckling)
     Arthur... mortally wounded. Please.

     ANTONIUS
     Arthur defeated Mordred at the Battle of Camlann. After which, he
     and his fellow knights set off to find the Sangreal.

     DANIEL
     That's the Holy Grail.

     ANTONIUS
     That was long ago, but we know in our hearts that one day, he will
     return to us.

     DANIEL
     Um, what happened to Merlin when he left?

   [Antonius looks disturbed by the question. Meurik is uncomfortable but
   covers it with a smile.]

     MEURIK
     I have matters to attend to. Best I take my leave now.

   [He stands up.]

     MEURIK
     Enjoy your stay with us.

   [He walks away.]

     DANIEL
     Did I offend him?

     ANTONIUS

     (sitting in the chair Meurik vacated)
     Not at all. It's just that...
     (lowering his voice)
     Merlin's name is rarely mentioned in public.

     DANIEL
     Why is that?

     ANTONIUS
     Well, many believe he was a wizard of darkness. He may have tried to
     do good, but there was always potential for great mischief in his
     heart. Thankfully, he has neither been seen nor heard of since
     Arthur's departure. The library where he practiced his strange arts
     remains sealed to this day.

     CARTER
     Merlin had a library here?

     ANTONIUS
     Of course. It was his private sanctuary here in Camelot.

     DANIEL

     (as if stating the obvious)
     We'd like to see that.

     ANTONIUS
     I'm afraid that's impossible. The library is protected by a powerful
     curse. It is said that all those who enter Merlin's sanctuary
     forfeit their lives to its guardian, the Black Knight.

   [SG-1 exchange looks of recognition and concern.]

   EXT--STABLES OUTSIDE PUB, DAY

   [SG-1 exit the pub and begin a slow walk through the village.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, so, best case scenario, this Curse of the Black Knight is a
     story Merlin made up to scare off the locals. Worst case scenario,
     he's got another holographic knight protecting his goods like he did
     back in England. Either way, I don't see a big problem.

   [Teal'c growls.]

     MITCHELL
     What?

     TEAL'C
     Given your narrow victory over the knight in the Avalon cave, it
     would seem that your over-confidence is ill-advised.

     MITCHELL
     Did I say anything about me doing the fighting?

     DANIEL
     The point is, the last time it was a test designed to measure a
     challenger's worth. This time it sounds more like a defense
     mechanism set up to protect Merlin's research, which means it could
     be a lot tougher, and the same rules might not apply.

     CARTER
     I think we should split up and look around.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Mitchell and Daniel continue the way they were headed, while Carter
   and Teal'c head the other way.]

   EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

   [A young boy and an older, taller girl practice sword fighting with
   wooden swords. The girl gets the upper hand.]

     VALENCIA
     Surrender, Mordred!

     RAMUS
     Never!

   [After more parrying, she overcomes him and holds her 'sword' to his
   throat.]

     VALENCIA
     Yield?

     RAMUS
     I yield. But next time, I want to be Arthur.

   [She laughs. Mitchell and Daniel approach.]

     MITCHELL
     I don't know if that's going to help, you keep moving around like Ed
     Grimley.

   [The children look at him, confused. Mitchell reaches for the strap
   that holds his machine gun to his vest.]

     MITCHELL
     Here, let me show you something.

   [He hands his gun to Daniel.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Ramus)
     You mind?

   [Ramus nods and hands Mitchell his wooden sword.]

     MITCHELL
     Thank you. Try not to bob around quite so much.

   [He turns to face Valencia and the cross their swords, then start
   sparring. They match each other parry for parry several times, then
   stop.]

     MITCHELL
     Nice.

   [They start again, but Mitchell grabs the sword from her almost
   instantly. She smiles at him, and Ramus comes out from the alcove where
   he's been standing.]

     VALENCIA
     Where did you learn to fight like that?

     MITCHELL
     Broomstick battles with my kid brother, and the Sodan ritual of kel
     shak lo made me the nimble warrior that I am today.

   [He hands the swords back to the children.]

     MITCHELL
     So, do either one of you know where we can find Merlin's, uh...

     DANIEL
     Oh, uh, library.

     MITCHELL
     Merlin's library.

   [The children become concerned.]

   EXT--VILLAGE STREET, DAY

   [Valencia and Ramus lead Mitchell and Daniel down a small street to a
   thatched-roof building. Valencia stops at the wooden door.]

     VALENCIA
     This is it. The door is magicked.

   [Daniel reaches for it, and his hand hits a force field. He pulls his
   hand back and flexes his fingers.]

     VALENCIA
     There is a key, but no one dare use it.

     DANIEL
     Where would we find this key?

     VALENCIA
     It is kept in the village archives.

   EXT--VILLAGE MARKETPLACE, DAY

   [Antonius shops for food using a wicker basket as Daniel speaks to him.
   It is raining, and Daniel is wet, his hair and jacket soaked. He holds
   his glasses in his hand.]

     ANTONIUS
     No! Absolutely not.

     DANIEL

     (intensely)
     Antonius.

     ANTONIUS
     I will not be party to your deaths. Your lives would be forfeit the
     instant you stepped inside.

     DANIEL

     (tugging Antonius' overgarment)
     We have faced one of Merlin's knights before.

     ANTONIUS
     Impossible. If you had, you would not be here to tell the tale.

     DANIEL

     Well I am, because we defeated him. And in defeating him, we
     acquired the treasures he had hidden away in our world. One of those
     treasures led us here, to Camelot.
     (changing to a calmer tack)
     Antonius, you're the village historian. Don't tell me you haven't
     dreamt about what might be inside there.

   [Antonius ponders what Daniel has said.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE OF CAMELOT, NIGHT

   [It is raining, but a partial moon is visible.]

   EXT--STREET NEAR LIBRARY, NIGHT

   [Antonius leads SG-1 to the library door, carrying a lantern.]

     ANTONIUS
     No one must know of my participation in this venture.

     MITCHELL
     You got it.

     ANTONIUS
     Not Meurik, not my fellow villagers, and most importantly, not my
     wife Livia, who believes I am reviewing council minutes with Brother
     Abelard tonight.

   [They reach the library, and Antonius takes out his key.]

     MITCHELL
     We were never here.

   [Antonius hand the lantern to Mitchell, then pushes the pen-like key
   into the lock. The force field flares then goes away as he pushes the
   key in again. He then unlocks the door in a conventional way, and it
   swings open. He takes the lantern back from Mitchell.]

   INT--MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [The library is dark and dusty, and cobwebs cover the various cages,
   books, candelabra, and sculptures. Mitchell enters first, led by his
   flashlight.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, spiders.

   [He clears away the cobwebs from the doorway and enters the large room.
   Daniel and Carter follow, also shining their flashlights. Antonius and
   Teal'c enter last. Daniel blows the dust off of one of many books. He
   gazes around with his flashlight.]

     DANIEL
     Yep, this could take a while.

   INT--MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [Sometime later, the room is largely cleaned up and is bathed in warm
   candlelight. Teal'c finishes lighting some candles from a ladder, then
   descends it. Daniel is reading a book aided by his flashlight. Carter
   is nearby.]

     DANIEL
     This is interesting. This is a-a reference to Merlin's prophetic
     abilities. There's a similar myth on Earth. That Merlin could see
     the future because he actually aged backwards in time. It's not
     meant to be taken literally, but we have seen that a lot of legends
     and folklore have a strong basis in fact. Avalon. Atlantis.

     TEAL'C

     (smiling at Antonius)
     The Easter Bunny.

     ANTONIUS
     Huh.

   [Daniel and Carter look at Teal'c, perplexed.]

     DANIEL
     I guess there's a few exceptions.

   [Teal'c gives Daniel a shocked and concerned look, that the Easter
   Bunny might not have a basis in fact.]

     CARTER
     Are you saying that there's time travel technology here?

     DANIEL
     I'm saying there could be anything around here.

     MITCHELL

     (standing up a few steps next to a bookshelf in an alcove)
     Well, I hate to break it to you folks, but the only technology I'm
     seeing is... a bunch of dusty old books.

   [Mitchell pushes on a book on a shelf. There is a creaking sound, and
   the entire bookshelf spins out of the way to reveal a narrow stone
   passage.]

     MITCHELL
     And a secret passage.

   [Mitchell points his flashlight into it and steps into it. The others
   climb the steps to where he is. He steps back out of the passage.]

     MITCHELL
     All right, there's another chamber.

     ANTONIUS

     (upset)
     We should not go in there! We've tempted fate enough for one night.

     MITCHELL
     Well, you can stay up here if you want.

     ANTONIUS
     No. I shall take my leave.

   [He turns and leaves as the others watch.]

   INT--INNER CHAMBER OF MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [The chamber is very dark, lit only by the light of SG-1's flashlights.
   Suddenly the logs in a fireplace come to life with a fire. Then torches
   lining the walls each light spontaneously. SG-1 look around and see a
   large Ancient control pedestal in the center of the room.]

     MITCHELL
     It's not a puzzle, is it?

     DANIEL
     No, it's an Ancient control device.

     MITCHELL
     What is it controlling?

     DANIEL
     I have no idea.

   [Daniel steps up to the device. A light above it activates and shines
   on a large array of moveable panels, each with Ancient writing on them.
   The rest of the team joins him and prepares to investigate.]

   INT--ANTONIUS' BEDROOM

   [Antonius enters his bedroom carefully and sets his lantern on a side
   table; he also carries a book. The bed is made and empty. He begins to
   walk around the room, searching.]

     ANTONIUS
     Livia?

   [There is a noise behind him, and he turns to see a Black Night inside
   his room, silhouetted against his window. The knight swings his sword
   up into position for battle and walks toward Antonius].</blockquote>

   INT--INNER CHAMBER OF MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [SG-1 stand around the device.]

     DANIEL
     We've seen this type of interface before. Activating it is a matter
     of correctly interpreting these symbols.

   [They hear a piercing scream from outside. The grab their weapons and
   run out of the room.]

   INT--ANTONIUS' BEDROOM

   [Several male villagers are in the room, talking quietly and nervously.
   Mitchell leads SG-1 into the room. They see Antonius' body on the
   floor, and Carter rushes to him and looks for a pulse.]

     CARTER
     He's dead!

   INT--VILLAGE PUB

   [It is the next day. Meurik slams a book down onto a table. It is the
   one Antonius carried from the library.]

     MEURIK

     (angry)
     How do you explain this?

   [He walks past each of SG-1, but they don't respond other than to look
   somewhat sheepish.]

     MEURIK
     Antonius had it with him when he was killed.

     CARTER
     Meurik, we're very sorry about what happened--

     MEURIK
     You went into the wizard's library, didn't you.

     DANIEL
     Yes, we did.

     MITCHELL
     Look, it wasn't supposed to go down like that. We figured if the
     knight was going to appear, it would be in the chamber, and he
     wouldn't go after anybody but us.

     MEURIK
     You were warned of the danger, and you refused to believe. You
     awakened the curse.

     DANIEL
     The Black Knight is not part of any curse. He isn't magical and he
     isn't unbeatable.

     TEAL'C
     Your world as well as countless others are in danger of being
     overrun by an enemy far more powerful than you could ever imagine.
     They are called the Ori, and they will destroy anyone who does not
     kneel before them.

     DANIEL
     We learned that a long time ago, Merlin was working on a weapon that
     could be used against them. And the key to finding that weapon is
     inside that library.

     MEURIK
     I have never seen nor heard of these Ori, but we have witnessed the
     power of the Black Knight. Leave this village. Take the curse with
     you.

   [Meurik leaves; SG-1 are deflated and disappointed.]

     DANIEL

     (sitting on a table)
     Well, we can't just give up.

     CARTER
     Daniel, we're not exactly welcome here anymore.

     DANIEL
     Don't you see, this is exactly what Merlin wanted. Why do you think
     he designed the Black Knight to attack in the village and not the
     chamber? To incite terror. If he just killed whatever was inside the
     chamber, then there'd be no great public incentive to keep people
     out. You'd go in at your own risk, and there'd always be someone
     foolish enough to give it a try.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, someone like us.

     DANIEL
     Look, the point is, that he designed it that way because he was
     worried that someone might stumble onto the solution. Which means
     there is a solution, and it's inside that chamber.

     CARTER
     A shut-off switch.

     DANIEL
     Exactly.

     MITCHELL
     Well, that's great. But how does it help us now?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. Just, give me a little time to talk to these people.
     If I can get some of them on our side, we might be able to get
     Meurik to reconsider.

   [Mitchell raises his hand in dubious approval. Daniel picks up his gun
   and leaves.]

   EXT--VILLAGE CENTER, DAY

   [Mitchell walks around the stone platform with the sword in it.
   Valencia watches from nearby.]

     VALENCIA

     (approaching)
     Only he who is pure of heart and true of spirit can pull the sword
     from the stone. It is said Arthur will not return from his quest
     until one among us succeeds in removing it.

     MITCHELL
     You ever try it?

     VALENCIA
     Of course not. It is for the young men preparing to be knights to
     test themselves with the sword. As my brother Ramus will do when he
     comes of age.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, but I've seen you spar. You've got the skills.

     VALENCIA
     I only do that to help Ramus train. When Arthur does come back, he
     will need knights to join him on his next crusade. The men of this
     village will be ready to serve him.

     MITCHELL
     And you're not interested in that.

   [She looks at him, considering. Meurik approaches from up the street,
   villagers and the rest of SG-1 with him.]

     MEURIK
     Valencia, leave us.

     VALENCIA

     (fearful)
     Yes, Governor.

   [She leaves.]

     MEURIK
     You abuse my tolerant nature, Colonel.

     MITCHELL

     (to Daniel)
     I take it it didn't go so well.

     DANIEL
     Not really.

   [They gather near the entrance to the village.]

     MEURIK
     These men will escort you to the great ring and ensure that you
     leave as requested.

     DANIEL
     Look, you're making a mistake. There is no curse. Now, the Black
     Knight is a science feature, created by Merlin through the use of
     science and advanced technology. There is no magic involved--

   [Just as he finishes, all of SG-1 are beamed out by an Asgard beam. The
   villagers murmur in confusion, and Meurik hugs the woman next to him.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [SG-1 arrive on the bridge, just in front of the forward viewscreens.]

     EMERSON
     SG-1, welcome aboard the Odyssey.

     MITCHELL
     Colonel. What's going on?

     EMERSON
     Change of plans.

   [Emerson walks over to a large display on the wall of the bridge. SG-1
   follow him.]

     EMERSON
     We received a sub-space transmission from a Jaffa vessel near
     P3Y-229. They were investigating some unusual energy readings. This
     is what they found.

   [He pushes some buttons and space scene shows. He zooms in.]

     EMERSON
     When we enhance the image...

   [The display shows a Supergate.]

     CARTER
     A fully formed Supergate.

     EMERSON
     Stargate Command tried to dial 229, but couldn't get a lock.

     CARTER
     The planet was probably destroyed in the formation of the
     micro-singularity.

     EMERSON
     My orders were to pick you up and proceed immediately to the
     Supergate. Unfortunately, the Deadelus is still in the Pegasus
     galaxy, but the Korolev will be joining us as soon as possible.

     CARTER
     I didn't think it was operational yet.

     EMERSON

     It's been rushed into service. We're to meet up with as many Jaffa
     and Tok'ra ships as we can muster and destroy that thing by whatever
     means necessary.
     (to Marks)
     Set a course.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   [Emerson walks back to his command chair. Daniel walks around the front
   of the bridge to face him.]

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute. We can't go yet.

     EMERSON
     We don't have any more time, Doctor. By all indications, that
     Spacegate's operational. There's no telling when the Ori are going
     to start sending ships through.

     DANIEL
     Okay, uh, go, but leave me behind. Colonel, I believe the key to
     defeating the Ori is on that planet. I know it.

     CARTER
     Daniel, even if you're right, the villagers are never going to let
     you back in the library.

     DANIEL
     Then, beam me in.

     EMERSON

     (after a moment of consideration)
     All right, you get one more chance.

     MITCHELL

     I'll go with Jackson.
     (noting Daniel's surprised look)
     A little quality time. And that Black Knight might show up again.

     EMERSON
     We'll have the Russians swing by and pick you up on the way through.
     You have until then.

     MITCHELL
     Thank you, sir.

   [Daniel and Mitchell leave. Carter walks over to the Supergate image on
   the display.]

   INT--MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [Daniel and Mitchell beam in.]

     MITCHELL
     So, what now?

   [Daniel starts up the staircase to the loft overlooking the library.]

     DANIEL
     Well, all indications are the Black Knight was activated the second
     I stepped onto that platform. So, my guess is we can shut him down
     by inputting the correct code sequence on that control panel.

     MITCHELL
     Merlin's PIN number?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, something like that.

     MITCHELL
     So, how do we find it?

   [Daniel picks up one of many books and opens it.]

     DANIEL

     (gesturing to the whole room)
     By analyzing these documents.

     MITCHELL
     You do realize we're on the clock, right?

   [Daniel gives him an annoyed look.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Course is plotted, sir.

     EMERSON
     Very well.

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Emerson, I wish to be transferred to the nearest
     Jaffa-controlled vessel.

     EMERSON

     DANIEL

     That's it.

   [At the lack of response from Mitchell, Daniel turns around to see him
   dozing in a chair. Daniel drops a large book onto the floor. The sound
   jolts Mitchell awake.]

     DANIEL

     (not sorry)
     Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.

     MITCHELL
     No, uh, I wasn't sleeping. I was kel-no-reeming. Teal'c taught me
     the fundamentals.

     DANIEL

     (reading a page of Ancient text)
     Did he mention you should remain conscious in the process?

     MITCHELL

     Yeah, I'm still working on the basics.
     (getting up)
     So, you got something?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I've cross-referenced half a dozen passages that mention the
     Black Knight. Now, there's a series of recurring words and phrases
     that stand out, if you know what you're looking for.

     MITCHELL
     Are we talking access code?

     DANIEL
     I think so.

   [Daniel goes back to his book, and Mitchell pats him hard on the back.]

   INT--INNER CHAMBER OF MERLIN'S LIBRARY

   [Daniel and Mitchell enter, both carrying their weapons. Daniel also
   carries a stack of books. He hesitates to step onto the platform.]

     MITCHELL
     What's the matter?

     DANIEL
     Well, if I'm wrong about this, then...

     MITCHELL
     No, look, I'll take care of the Black Knight.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, how are you going to do that again?

     MITCHELL
     I will pull the sword from the stone, just like last time.

     DANIEL
     Well, I think we've been over this. This is a completely different
     scenario. You see, in the Avalon cave, it was pulling the sword from
     the stone that caused the knight to appear in the first place. Here,
     we don't even know if they're connected.

     MITCHELL
     We know Merlin put the sword there, right?

     DANIEL
     Probably.

     MITCHELL
     Which means it's no ordinary sword, and that's good enough for me.
     Besides, do we have a choice?

     DANIEL
     No.

   [Mitchell gestures, and the both step up onto the platform. It lights
   up as before.]

   [They look around for a moment, waiting for something to happen. When
   it doesn't, Daniel sets his weapon and the books on the edge of the
   platform and opens one book to a particular page. Looking at it, he
   begins pressing the large stone tiles of the control device, one by
   one. He finishes.]

     DANIEL
     Uh oh.

     MITCHELL
     What oh?

     DANIEL
     Nothing happened.

     MITCHELL
     Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

   [They hear a woman screaming.]

     DANIEL AND MITCHELL

     (in unison)
     Bad!

     MITCHELL

     (heading toward the door with his weapon)
     You stay, I'll go. Make it work!

     DANIEL

     (doubtfully)
     Okay.

   EXT--VILLAGE STREET, DAY

   [Mitchell comes running out into the street, his weapon ready. The
   villagers are panicked and scattering. He looks up.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh boy.

   [The Black Knight heads for him, spinning his sword in one arm then
   holding it with two hands, prepared to fight.]

     MITCHELL
     Everybody down!

   [Mitchell begins firing at the knight. The bullets pass through, doing
   no harm.]

     MITCHELL
     No, didn't think so.

   [The knight comes at him, swinging his sword again. Mitchell drops his
   gun and runs at the knight, then ducks under his sword blows, jumps
   over a cart, and rolls in the mud. Valencia enters the square and sees
   what is going on. The knight strikes Mitchell in the back, causing an
   energy flare instead of a true wound. Mitchell slides on his side as
   the knight keeps swinging.]

     Oh, not so good!

   [Mitchell reaches a table, grabs a sword from it, and knocks the table
   over. He begins trading sword blows with the knight. His blows slide
   right through the knight, ineffective. The knight hits Mitchell in the
   head with his sword. Mitchell falls onto his back on the ground.
   Valencia rushes up to Meurik.]

     VALENCIA
     Do something! Help him!

     MEURIK
     He brought this on himself.

   [Mitchell gets up and looks around at the villagers as if looking for
   help. The knight strikes him again, over and over. Mitchell falls to
   his knees. Horrified, Valencia runs back to the sword and stone
   platform, climbs up onto it, and starts pulling at the sword. Meurik
   follows.]

     MEURIK
     What do yo think you're doing?

   [After a couple of pulls, the sword loosens, and Valencia pulls it out
   completely. The villagers who have seen look on in shock. Valencia
   takes the sword and runs back toward the fight. Mitchell sees her. She
   throws the sword to him, and he catches it by the hilt. He turns and
   swings at the knight. Now his sword has a physical effect, and it
   strikes the knight's sword. They parry fiercely. The knight strikes
   Mitchell in the face with his hand and knocks him down.]

   suddenly the room is lined in piles of treasure: gold plates and vases,
   jewels, piled on the floor and on tables. A hologram of a white-haired
   old man in wizard clothing appears. He has a large red pendant around
   his neck.]

     (holding his arms out in welcome)
     Greetings, friend. I am Merlin.

     DANIEL
     Yes, you are.

   him twice in the back, and he falls to his knees.]

   a button at the base of the pedestal. A panel opens, filled with
   disk-shaped, lighted crystal pieces. Daniel looks at it in
   frustration.]

     DANIEL
     Ah, screw it.

   [He pulls out his pistol and fires twice into the crystals. Their
   lights go out. Merlin disappears.]

   EXT--VILLAGE STREET, DAY

   [Just as the Black Knight is about to stab Mitchell, who is lying on
   his stomach on the ground, the knight disappears. The villagers begin
   cheering. Valencia and Meurik approach Mitchell. People being to
   congratulate Valencia. Mitchell points to her and tries to get up, but
   can't. The villagers surround Valencia, all smiling and clapping.
   Meurik still looks concerned but finally smiles at Valencia. Mitchell
   falls back onto his back, exhausted.]

     Pretty much.

     MITCHELL

     Sounds like one of my plans.
     (grunting in pain)
     How come you didn't do that in the first place?

     DANIEL

     Well, because I had to find the access code first. If I hadn't,
     (gesturing to treasure)
     none of this would have beamed in, and I wouldn't have seen Merlin's
     hologram message.

     MITCHELL

     (stretching his back)
     Right. What did he say?

     DANIEL

     (opening the book to a certain page)
     Well, I think it was a riddle, and I believe I figured it out.

   [He places the book on the pedestal and shows Mitchell a black and
   white drawing of Merlin in it.]

     DANIEL
     You see, this pendant. Now in every depiction of Merlin from his
     library, I've seen it. And in fact the hologram message was wearing
     it as well. But I've never seen it before. Not in any reference
     material back on Earth.

     MITCHELL
     And you think that's the device we're looking for.

     DANIEL
     The riddle mentions a pendulum. Now at first I thought that was a
     reference to a passage of time, like a pendulum clock. Then I
     realized it was more literal. Something that hangs. It also said, it
     was right before my eyes.

     MITCHELL

     (looking at the sketch)
     I don't know. Does that seem a little small?

     DANIEL
     Just remember we're talking about things that transcend ordinary
     space-time, here. Relative size has no meaning.

     KVASIR
     We have been analyzing the information that Daniel Jackson was able
     to retrieve from Merlin's phase shifting device.

     CARTER
     Unfortunately, he didn't get very far before it permanently ran out
     of power.

     KVASIR
     There was enough data for us to surmise what this so-called anti-Ori
     weapon might be.

     CARTER
     Really. I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it.

     KVASIR

     (smugly)
     Really?

     CARTER

     (annoyed)
     Just tell me what you've got.

     KVASIR
     It is an energy transfer device, similar to a Zero Point Module,
     except that the energy is channeled not from sub-space into ordinary
     space-time, but rather into the dimension occupied by Ascended
     beings.

     CARTER
     And this energy is harmful to them in some way.

     KVASIR
     It is a form of interference. A simply analogy would be two standing
     waves canceling each other out. If the weapon indeed works the way
     Merlin's writings imply, we would simply need to activate it and
     send it to the Ori galaxy, and they would be eliminated.

     CARTER
     Yeah, but how do we do that? I mean, we don't even know where the
     Ori galaxy is, let alone have the ability to send something there.

     KVASIR
     That is where you're mistaken.

     CARTER

     (after a moment of thought)
     You're talking about the Supergate. We dial out before they can dial
     in!

     KVASIR
     Precisely.

     CARTER
     That might actually work.

     KVASIR
     Of course, we will need Merlin's weapon. If Colonel Mitchell and
     Doctor Jackson don't find it...

     CARTER
     Don't worry... They'll find it.

     Yeah. It's all yours.

     MEURIK

   picture of Merlin. He holds it out for Meurik to see.]

     Do you recognize this?

     MEURIK
     It is the Sangreal.

     DANIEL
     This is the Sangreal?

     MEURIK
     It is also known as the Blood Stone.

     DANIEL
     Of course, sang. Blood. Blood red for the color of the jewel.

     MITCHELL
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're talking about the Holy Grail,
     right? Every movie I've seen, that's a cup.

     DANIEL
     No, the notion that the Grail was a cup or chalice, particularly the
     one used by Christ at the Last Supper, was a late addition to the
     myth. See, in earlier accounts it's described variously as a dish,
     or platter, or in the case of von Eschenbach and other middle
     eastern-influenced chroniclers, as a stone that fell from the
     heavens.

     MEURIK
     If this is what you seek, you will not find it among these trinkets.
     Arthur and his knights left to quest for the Sangreal long ago.

     MITCHELL
     Do you know where they went?

     MEURIK
     Of course. It is said that they journeyed to three distant lands
     mentioned in Merlin's prophecy: Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei.

     MITCHELL

     (to Daniel)
     Any of those spots ring a bell?

     DANIEL
     No, but if they were part of one of Merlin's prophecies, then any
     one his books could hold the key to what we're looking for.

     MITCHELL

     (becoming agitated)
     The books upstairs? Jackson, that's days, weeks to find the proper
     reference and then there's no guarantee that we're going to be able
     to track him down.

     MEURIK
     Searching for Arthur's whereabouts in this library is not necessary.
     Now, thanks to Valencia, we've been given a sign that Arthur will
     return soon. And you are welcome to stay with us and wait. As the
     men that conquered Merlin's Curse, you will be given a place of
     honor.

     DANIEL

     (resigned)
     Look. Once and for all, there was no curse. Okay?
     (pointing at pedestal)
     This? This is a device. It's a machine. It's like a flour mill or a
     catapult. It's just a lot more complicated.

     Jackson didn't find the device.

     CARTER
     Sir, even without Merlin's device, dialing out is still our best
     bet, because in the very least, it will prevent them from dialing
     in. It's possible that with the power generated by the singularity,

     house'."

     MITCHELL
     What was that?

     DANIEL
     Book of Origin.

     MITCHELL
     Think it'll help?

   [Daniel shrugs.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The central sections of each Ori ship begin to glow bright white.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     They're powering up their weapons.

     EMERSON
     Here we go. All batteries open fire.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Odyssey begins firing missiles by the dozen at the Ori ships.
   Other allied ships begin firing. The missiles strike the Ori shields
   and appear to do no damage. The Ori ships fire energy beams at Odyssey,
   hitting its shields. A smaller ship is destroyed with one blast.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE KOROLEV

   [The ship is rocked with each blast, and electrical damage is evident
   all over the bridge as crew members rush to try to contain it.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [The same sort of damage is being taken by Odyssey.]

     MARKS
     Shields down to fifty percent.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [A Jaffa ha'tak vessel moves in on an Ori ship as the Ori continue
   firing.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     Sir, we just lost sub-light engines.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Ori ships' shields repel all attacks as the Ori take out more
   small vessels.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     EMERSON
     Re-direct power to the engines! Begin evasive maneuvers!

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE KOROLEV

   [There is similar chaos on the bridge.]

     CHEKOV
     We've lost power!

     MITCHELL
     We have to scramble the 302's.

     CHEKOV
     No, they'll have no effect against that!

     MITCHELL
     Hey, we're getting our asses kicked. It's time to go all in! I'll
     draw their fire while you get the ship back on line.

     CHEKOV
     Go!

   [Mitchell runs from the bridge.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

     MARKS
     It's no good, sir. We're dead in the water. Sir, picking up
     approaching ships.

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [A fleet of three Lucian Alliance ships exit hyperspace behind and
   above the Ori ships; they begin firing immediately.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [Teal'c appears on the side viewscreen. ]

     TEAL'C
     Apologies for my late arrival.

     EMERSON
     Better late than never.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c walks away from the camera on his end. Netan stands in the
   background.]

     EMERSON
     Forget the engines. Give them everything we've got!

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The battle rages. A Lucian ships makes a firing pass. A ha'tak is
   destroyed, followed by another.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF LUCIAN SHIP

   [The ship is taking damage, sparks flying. Teal'c looks out the
   viewscreen in concern.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

   [There are fires on the bridge. Men fall injured.]

   INT--BRIDGE OF THE KOROLEV

   [Daniel falls to the floor as Chekov takes up the pilot's chair. Daniel
   pulls himself into the opposite chair and looks at the systems.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OF THE KOROLEV

   [Mitchell is thrown to the floor on his way to the 302 bay. He turns to
   see fires behind him, being tended by crewmen, then gets up and runs
   forward toward the bay.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

   [The Ori ships show no signs of their shields weakening. They destroy
   what appears to be a Daedalus-class ship. Carter watches, frightened
   and horrified. More allied ships are destroyed, their wreckage floating
   in space.]

   EXT--AN ORI SHIP

   [The ship is undamaged and no longer firing.]

   INT--ROOM ON BOARD ORI SHIP

   [Standing in a windowed room, looking out on the field of battle, is
   Vala, far along in her pregnancy. She watches horrified as one allied
   ship after another is destroyed. Appearing to feel a sudden pain, she
   grabs her belly in shock and worry, apparently unsure of what to do.]
