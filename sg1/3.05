   TEASER

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Children are doing archaeological work in the Gate room. One of the
   children climbs a ladder to the platform where Daniel is working and
   offers him some water.]

     DANIEL

     Thank you.
     (to one of the children)
     That's perfect Zaren, just like that.

   [The Stargate begins to dial up and its chevrons glow.]

     DANIEL

     (to the children)
     It's ok. It's just my friends returning.

   [The Stargate kwaooshes. O'Neill and Teal'c step out of the Stargate.
   Daniel leaves his work to go down and meet them.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello children. Daniel? No child labour laws here on Orban?

     DANIEL

     No, these are Urrone. They're like, uh, apprentices to the adults.
     They're...everywhere. It's just kind of the way they do things. Look
     at this.
     (He produces a bracelet and hands it to O'Neill)
     Chalchiutlicue, the Aztec goddess of water. I mean, they don't even
     know what they've got here, who knows what we're going to uncover.
     That is if General Hammond said yes. He did say...?

     O'NEILL

     (looking at the bracelet)
     He said yes.

   [Kalan enters the Gate room with Merrin.]

     KALAN
     Colonel O'Neill, you are most punctual. Both Merrin and I are eager
     to participate in this exchange between our worlds.

     O'NEILL
     Major Carter's eager as well. She's really looking forward to it.
     So's Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     I will share my knowledge of the Goa'uld freely.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c's eager on the inside.

     KALAN
     Then, if you are ready to leave?

     O'NEILL
     Kalan, I was under the impression we were bringing back one of your
     naquada reactors.

   [Kalan gestures to the metal box Merrin is carrying.]

     KALAN
     This is the device.

     O'NEILL
     That little thing? Ok. Daniel, have fun...I know you will. Teal'c,
     make friends as always.

   [Teal'c dials out and the Stargate opens.]

     O'NEILL
     Folks, to Earth.

   INT--SGC, CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Hammond are heading down a corridor towards the Gate room.]

     CARTER
     They're one of the most impressive societies we've ever come across,
     sir. They've managed to accomplish in a few decades what it took
     humans over a century to achieve.

     HAMMOND
     Sounds like these people might make good allies.

     CARTER
     I think so. They're not quite up to the Goa'uld level of technology
     yet, but given a few years...

   [She is cut off as O'Neill, Kalan and Merrin step out of the Stargate.
   Kalan makes a sign with his hands and bows.]

     KALAN
     Thank you for this exchange General Hammond. I'm sure it will be
     fruitful for both of our worlds. Major Carter, please allow Merrin
     to present you with this naquada reactor.

   [Merrin hands Carter the reactor.]

     KALAN
     You may study it for the duration of our exchange.

     CARTER
     Thank you.

     HAMMOND

     (to Kalan)
     If you will allow, I would like to offer a tour of...

     KALAN
     The exchange has been made. We will return to Orban now.

     O'NEILL
     You just got here.

     CARTER
     You can't leave. Someone needs to teach me how to use this thing.

   [Both Kalan and Merrin appear confused.]

     KALAN
     Please explain what you mean by this.

     CARTER
     Teaching? Uh, explaining how the reactor functions, its components,
     its construction.

     KALAN
     I do not have this knowledge.

     MERRIN

     (to Carter)
     I will...teach you.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC, ELEVATOR

   [O'Neill and Carter are riding in the elevator with Merrin.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Merrin)
     Major Carter will show you the lab. But before you get started,
     Merrin, I'd like you to visit our infirmary.

     CARTER
     It's standard procedure, nothing to be afraid of.

     MERRIN
     You must screen newcomers for potential pathogens. Of course.

   [They step out of the elevator and head down the corridor.]

     O'NEILL
     So Merrin, I understand you're a reactor expert.

     MERRIN
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     How old are you?

     MERRIN
     I am eleven. How old are you?

     O'NEILL
     So Merrin, I understand you're a reactor expert.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [People are moving boxes while Daniel works on a half-covered mosaic
   surrounding the DHD. Kalan enters with a boy.]

     KALAN
     This is my son, Tomin. He is also Urrone. Teal'c, you will please
     tell him of the Goa'uld.

     TOMIN

     (to Teal'c)
     You are most generous to offer your knowledge Teal'c.

     DANIEL
     Kalan, there was an apprentice here earlier, Zarin. Do you know
     where she went?

     KALAN
     Zarin is not here. It was past her time to experience her Averium.

     DANIEL
     Averium? Is that like a graduation?

     KALAN
     That is an approximate definition. Dr Jackson, you expressed an
     interest in viewing the city. It is advantageous to see the Pyramid
     of Suns in daylight.

     DANIEL
     Yes, absolutely.

     KALAN
     Teal'c, you will please remain here with Tomin.

   [Kalan and Daniel leave. Tomin is studying Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C

     (to Tomin)
     What is your purpose?

     TOMIN
     I am making an observation of your physical characteristics. Dr
     Jackson tells us you were once a warrior in the service of the
     Goa'uld.

     TEAL'C
     That is correct.

     TOMIN
     I think I understand now why the Goa'uld are so feared.

   INT--SGC, INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is taking a blood sample from Merrin.]

     FRAISER

     (to Merrin)
     Hurts a little bit, huh?

   [Merrin nods.]

     FRAISER
     You are being very brave.

   [O'Neill enters the infirmary.]

     O'NEILL
     How's our little rocket scientist doing?

     FRAISER
     We are almost done, Colonel.

     MERRIN
     I am not a rocket scientist.

     CARTER
     Uh, I think what Colonel O'Neill means is that you're very smart.

     MERRIN
     You find my intelligence level unusual?

     O'NEILL
     No, there are lots of intelligent people around here. Just not as
     young as you.

     MERRIN
     You mean you were not always as smart as you are now?

     FRAISER
     No. We spent a long time in school to get to this point.

     MERRIN
     Please explain what 'school' is.

     CARTER
     Uh, school is a place where you go to learn. A teacher gives you
     information and you take different classes to learn different
     subjects.

     MERRIN
     So this is how you and Dr. Fraiser became scientists?

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     Mm-hmm.

     MERRIN

     (to O'Neill)
     You aren't a scientist?

     O'NEILL
     Oh no.

     MERRIN
     Then you are not as smart as Major Carter and Dr. Fraiser.

   [Carter tries to hide her smile.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, it depends on what you mean by...Ok, no. I'm not. But while
     they were stuck in school, I was out doing other things.
     Like...having fun.

   [Merrin appears confused by this.]

     O'NEILL
     You do know what fun is, don't you?

   [Merrin shakes her head.]

     O'NEILL
     Ok, fun is...what you do to make yourself happy. Like music, games.
     It's whatever you do when you're not learning to be a rocket
     scientist.

     MERRIN
     I am here to...'teach' Major Carter about the reactor.

     CARTER
     Sounds like fun to me.

     O'NEILL
     Whatever. Yeah, go ahead, knock yourself out.

     CARTER
     Come on, Merrin, I'll show you the lab.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c and Tomin are sitting on the steps to the Stargate.]

     TOMIN
     But you have found hosts for other Goa'uld in the past as First
     Prime to the Goa'uld leader.

     TEAL'C
     I have vowed to battle the Goa'uld and to free my people. If I allow
     this symbiote that I carry to be implanted, I would be perpetuating
     all that I oppose.

     TOMIN
     What happens if you do not find a host for this Goa'uld?

     TEAL'C
     It will die.

     TOMIN
     If the Goa'uld dies, then you will die as well?

   [Teal'c inclines his head in assent.]

     TOMIN
     That would be unfortunate.

   EXT--ORBAN (DAY)

   [In the distance is a large pyramid. Daniel and Kalan head back into
   the Gate room.]

     DANIEL

     (excitedly)
     I should have known by the murals, but the tabuleiro construction of
     your pyramid confirms it.

     KALAN
     But Dr. Jackson I--I do not understand.

     DANIEL
     Teotihucan. It was a city in pre-Colombian South America, even
     bigger than Ancient Rome. Which...wouldn't mean anything to you, but
     it is significant.

     KALAN
     But you said we are Aztec.

     DANIEL
     No, these people predated the Aztecs.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel goes over to the half-covered mosaic surrounding the DHD.]

     DANIEL

     (to Kalan)
     Ok, look. These pictures form a narrative. Now what ever is under
     this platform may tell us exactly how your people came to be on
     Orban.

     KALAN
     You will explain this to Tomin.

   [Tomin and Teal'c walk over.]

     DANIEL

     (to Tomin)
     Ok. Teotihuacan flourished for centuries as a religious and economic
     Mecca before suffering a great upheaval in 750AD. Now, I think that
     your people could be the descendants of that civilisation.

     TOMIN
     Do you believe the arrival of the Goa'uld caused Teotihuacan's
     downfall?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [A reactor is hooked up to a computer.]

     CARTER
     Ok, the carocev, that's the converter, right?

     MERRIN
     The heating element.

     CARTER
     What? When did we talk about the heating element?

     MERRIN
     In the very beginning when I described the fodinaire.

     CARTER
     Oh man. It can't be this hard.

     MERRIN
     I will begin again.

     CARTER
     No, no, wait. Let's try this a different way. How about we break
     everything down into its most basic components? Let's start with the
     reactor casing. What's it made of?

     MERRIN
     The fodinaire attaches to...

     CARTER
     No, I'm sorry Merrin, we'll get to that in a minute. Right now, I
     just need to know what materials make up the reactor casing.

   [Merrin doesn't appear to know.]

     CARTER
     It'll have to block radiation, so we'll make it lead-lined. See?
     This is easy. And the casing material would have to measure...

   [She takes out a rule and starts to measure the reactor. Dr. Fraiser
   enters the lab.]

     FRAISER

     (to Carter)
     Major? If you don't mind, I'd like to see Merrin in the infirmary
     again. Just a couple of follow up tests.

   [She smiles, but Carter senses something is wrong.]

     CARTER
     Ok.

   [Carter and Merrin head out of the laboratory with Dr. Fraiser.]

   EXT--SGC (NIGHT)

   [A lone airman is patrolling the area.]

   INT--SGC, INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser turns the computer's monitor so that Hammond, O'Neill and
   Carter can see the screen. It holds a picture of Merrin's blood cells.]

     FRAISER
     Merrin's blood-work shows trace levels of silicon, trinium and some
     other element I have never seen before. Now, I think it's a mineral
     but it is definitely not found on Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Ok, even I know that's bad.

     FRAISER
     Well I found out what was responsible.

   [She hits a button and the image changes. A dark object can be seen
   floating amongst the blood cells.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     A nanite.

     HAMMOND
     She's got nanites in her blood?

     FRAISER
     Yes. However, it still didn't explain Merrin's abnormally high
     neural-peptide levels. So I did a computer enhanced MRI. You ready
     for this one?

   [She hits another key and the image changes to Merrin's MRI scan, which
   contains a huge amount of nanites.]

     FRAISER
     There's millions of them. They've infested that little girl's brain.

   INT--SGC, INFIRMARY

     FRAISER
     I've put the base on a Threatcon Bravo. Doctor, get blood samples
     from everyone. I want to know how far those nanites have spread.

   [Merrin, sitting on an infirmary bed, overhears them.]

     MERRIN
     My nano-processors are harmless to you.

     O'NEILL
     Merrin, we've run into these little beggars before. And they're
     anything but harmless.

     CARTER
     We encountered a civilisation in which the Goa'uld used a similar
     method, nanocites, to accelerate the age of a population. Colonel
     O'Neill was...adversely affected.

     O'NEILL
     Oy.

     MERRIN
     These nanites were created by Orbanians, in an Orbanian laboratory
     49 years ago. All of my people have them. It is a way we acquire
     knowledge.

     FRAISER
     Wait a minute. So you're saying, Merrin, that all Orbanians' brains
     look like this?

     MERRIN
     Each citizen receives a nanite after every Averium. Urrone children
     are given millions more nanites at birth because we are required to
     learn vast amounts of information very quickly. This must be done at
     infancy, before the neural-pathways are established.

     CARTER
     So, these nanites act as additional synapses?

     MERRIN
     Yes. But that is all they do. They do not age us and cannot leave
     the brain.

     FRAISER
     But Merrin, we found one of these nanites in your blood.

     MERRIN
     Well, if a nanite malfunctions it is programmed to disconnect from
     the brain and be absorbed into the blood stream. Those are inactive
     and incapable of harming others. I'm sorry if I have alarmed you and
     I understand if you wish me to return to Orban.

     CARTER
     Oh, I don't think that that would be necessary...do you, General?

     HAMMOND
     If you think it's safe, Major Carter, then you can continue to work.
     But I still want those blood samples Doctor.

     FRAISER
     Yes, sir.

   [Carter and Merrin head back to the laboratory.]

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Kalan is examining the mosaics around the DHD. Tomin approaches.]

     TOMIN
     Father?

   [Kalan stands to face him.]

     TOMIN
     I wish to undergo the Averium immediately.

     KALAN
     Tomin, it is six months until you turn twelve.

     TOMIN
     I am concerned by what Teal'c has told me of these Goa'uld. If they
     learn of our existence, they will destroy us. The studies I have
     made about new defence technologies must now be put to use, so that
     Orban can begin preparations.

     KALAN
     I will notify the elders. You have learned well my son. I am proud.

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [Merrin takes one of Carter's plants from a shelf.]

     MERRIN
     You study botany as well, Major?

     CARTER
     Oh no, those are just decoration.

   [Merrin replaces the plant. She examines the reactor Carter has
   designed.]

     MERRIN
     That does not look like a naquada reactor core.

     CARTER
     Yeah. Well I had to improvise since we're only using a microscopic
     amount of naquada. How about you sketch it for me?

     MERRIN
     What?

     CARTER
     Draw me your reactor core. Give me an idea of what it looks like.

     MERRIN
     I don't 'draw'.

     CARTER
     You don't draw? Everyone draws.

     MERRIN
     No. It is not something I am required to do. I've never had to
     'draw' before.

     CARTER
     Well, it's pretty easy.

   [She takes a pad and pencil and sketches a matchstick figure.]

     CARTER
     See?

     MERRIN
     What is that?

     CARTER
     It's a picture of me.

   [Merrin looks at the picture, then at Carter.]

     CARTER
     Well, I know it doesn't exactly look like me, but it's just a basic
     representation. That's all I need from you is just a basic
     representation of the reactor's core.

     MERRIN

     All right.
     (She accepts Carter's pencil)
     But this paper is not large enough.

   [Carter rummages around in one of the cupboards and brings out a larger
   pad.]

     CARTER
     How's this?

     MERRIN
     It will do.

   [Merrin starts to sketch the reactor as Carter watches.]

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel is chiselling away the last of the concrete covering the mosaic
   around the DHD. Teal'c enters the Gate room.]

     TEAL'C
     Kel mel, Daniel Jackson.

   [Daniel turns over a piece of concrete to reveal a drawing of a Serpent
   Guard.]

     DANIEL
     Look at this. This proves the Goa'uld were here sometime in the last
     few hundred years. Now we just need to figure out why they left.

   [Kalan enters the Gate room with a boy in tow and places a bag of tools
   down by Daniel.]

     KALAN
     Dr. Jackson, I've got the tools you asked. Teal'c, you will please
     tell Solen methods to fight the Goa'uld. Which weapons and
     strategies have been effective in their defeat. Also, anything in
     your experience as First Prime to Apophis that would be of
     assistance.

     SOLEN
     It is an honour to accept your knowledge Teal'c.

     TEAL'C

     (to Kalan)
     Perhaps it would be better for Tomin to return.

     KALAN
     He is unavailable. Solen will learn now.

     TEAL'C
     Tomin is already familiar with the subject.

     KALAN
     He has given us his knowledge. Please, you will talk to Solen.

     DANIEL
     Well, Teal'c has a point. I mean, if they've already established a
     rapport...

     KALAN
     I have told you it is impossible for Tomin to be here. He has gone
     through the Averium.

   [Teal'c and Daniel exchange a look.]

     KALAN
     Please Teal'c, begin.

     TEAL'C
     I would like to see Tomin immediately.

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [Merrin is standing on a chair, attempting to reach into a wall cabinet
   as O'Neill enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Merrin. What are you doing? Get down.

   [He lifts her down from the chair.]

     MERRIN
     Colonel O'Neill, I need fifteen sheets of paper, at least 48 cm by
     23 cm.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's fine, why don't you just ask...?

   [He stops when he sees Carter asleep, her head on her arms.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering to Merrin)
     Excuse me.
     (to Carter)
     Major Carter!

   [Carter wakes up with a start.]

     CARTER
     Oh, Merrin I am so sorry.

   [She gets up and looks at the drawings Merrin has done.]

     CARTER
     Wow. These are amazing.

     MERRIN
     I cannot represent the reactor core in a three-dimensional plane, so
     I depicted several layers of the reactor's interior. With additional
     supplies, I can finish the remaining layers.

     CARTER
     Cross-sections. Of course! If I scan these into the computer, I can
     come up with a three-dimensional representation of the reactor's
     interior.

     O'NEILL
     All right! Will you two give it a rest? Both of you. You've been at
     this for twenty-four hours. You need rest.

     MERRIN
     I do not need to. Urrone children require little sleep.

     CARTER
     Ok, now I am jealous.

     O'NEILL

     All right, Carter, you sleep.
     (to Merrin)
     Young lady, if not sleep...fun.

     MERRIN
     No, I need fifteen sheets of paper, at least 43cm by 28cm.

     O'NEILL
     Fifteen?

     MERRIN
     Colonel O'Neill? I require some of these 'pencils' as well.

   [O'Neill leaves to get the supplies for her.]

   INT--ORBAN, CHILDREN'S HOME

   [As Kalan approaches, Tomin is sitting on top of a bunk, fidgeting,
   while Teal'c and Daniel stand before him.]

     TEAL'C

     (to Tomin)
     Do you not recognise me? It is Teal'c.

   [Tomin doesn't respond.]

     TEAL'C
     Kalan!

   [Kalan enters the room.]

     TEAL'C
     Explain this Averium.

     KALAN
     It is the ceremony in which an Urrone's nanites are removed and then
     distributed. Each adult and each non-Urrone child then receives an
     injection containing one nanite, which becomes part of his or her
     synaptic network, adding to those nanites received from previous
     Averiums.

     DANIEL
     So when you say he gave you his knowledge, you meant it literally.

     KALAN
     It was a beautiful ceremony. Now you have seen. We must resume our
     work, Dr. Jackson.

     TEAL'C
     What will become of Tomin?

     KALAN
     He stays here with the other past Urrone.

     DANIEL
     That's it? You're...don't you play with him?

     KALAN
     Well what is play?

     DANIEL
     Interacting with him, teaching him new things.

     KALAN
     These children cannot be taught.

     DANIEL
     Have you ever tried?

     KALAN
     Oh yes, but past Urrone children cannot receive new nanites. The
     brain rejects them.

     DANIEL
     Well have you ever tried teaching him without nanites?

   [Kalan appears confused.]

     KALAN
     What do you mean?

   [Daniel and Teal'c share a concerned glance.]

     KALAN
     There is no need for concern. These children are well cared for.

     DANIEL
     Kalan...this is your son.

     KALAN
     My son...is here now.

   [He points to his own head.]

   INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c is reporting to Hammond. Carter, O'Neill and Dr. Fraiser are
   present.]

     TEAL'C
     Kalan says that Tomin is not brain-damaged. Clearly he was not
     himself.

     FRAISER
     Well, if the nanites have taken over the learning process and
     prevented the brain from developing a normal amount of synapses,
     then there's a good chance that they're removal would make these
     children...infant like.

     O'NEILL
     What's the difference if they keep them locked up in a room?

     HAMMOND
     So once Merrin returns to Orban, she will undergo this Averium and
     her nanites will be removed?

     FRAISER
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Then maybe she won't return to Orban.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel...

     O'NEILL
     General! She's going back to get her brains sucked out. And I dare
     anybody to phrase it more delicately.

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Sir, I agree with you. But we can't just keep Merrin here, can we?

     O'NEILL
     Why not? We'd be saving her life.

     FRAISER
     Ok, why don't we just simply try asking Kalan not to harvest
     Merrin's nanites?

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe the Orbanians would understand the reason for your
     request. They do not see this as wrong.

     O'NEILL
     Well then we need to make them understand.

     HAMMOND

     Teal'c, return to Orban.
     (to O'Neill)
     Colonel, before we risk an interplanetary incident, I'd like to try
     the diplomatic route first.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Kalan walks into the Gate room, Teal'c and Daniel following.]

     KALAN
     How can you make this demand?

     DANIEL
     Kalan, no one is demanding anything.

     TEAL'C
     We do not believe the Averium would be in Merrin's best interest.

     KALAN
     It is most certainly in her best interest, for her and her people.

     DANIEL
     Ok, you see, in our cultures, we don't believe in doing anything
     that results in harming a child.

     KALAN
     We do not harm our children, Dr. Jackson! You have seen Tomin! You
     have seen how well he is cared for.

     DANIEL
     Ok, I think we can work this out. We just need to sit down and
     discuss some alternatives.

     KALAN
     There are no alternatives! Merrin must undergo the Averium. You will
     return her immediately.

   [He storms out of the Gate room.]

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [O'Neill and Carter are attempting to persuade Merrin to ask for
   asylum.]

     MERRIN
     The Averium is a great honour.

     O'NEILL
     Merrin, I know that's what the adults have told you. But when they
     take out these...nanite things, they also take out everything that
     makes you...you.

     MERRIN
     But my people will have my knowledge.

     O'NEILL
     But you won't.

     MERRIN
     I do not understand why you are so concerned.

     CARTER
     Merrin, we just don't think you realise what you'd be giving up by
     going through the Averium.

     MERRIN
     It is a great honour to be chosen.

     O'NEILL
     Will you please...stop saying that?

   [Hammond and Teal'c appear in the doorway.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, a word please.

   [O'Neill heads over to them.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Kalan refused our request. Daniel Jackson remained behind to attempt
     to alter his position.

     O'NEILL
     Good. It'll give us a chance to make Merrin understand.

     HAMMOND
     She's already refused amnesty, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     General, it's obvious that little girl's been brainwashed. We can't
     send her back without at least trying.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, do you foresee any danger to Dr. Jackson if he stays on
     Orban?

     TEAL'C
     I do not believe Daniel Jackson will be harmed.

     HAMMOND
     I'll give it forty-eight hours.

   [O'Neill returns to the laboratory.]

     O'NEILL
     Merrin. It looks like you're gonna be spending a little more time
     with us.

     MERRIN
     Please return me to Orban.

     O'NEILL
     You do understand we're trying to help, right?

     MERRIN
     I don't need your help.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [Kalan is punching the coordinates for Earth into the DHD when Daniel
   stops him.]

     DANIEL
     Kalan, you can't do this.

     KALAN
     If you will not return Merrin to us, I will retrieve her myself.

     DANIEL
     If you don't transmit a special code, they will close the iris and
     you won't get through. You will die.

   [Kalan gestures Solen forward to receive the information.]

     SOLEN

     (to Daniel)
     Please explain this iris.

     DANIEL

     (to Kalan)
     I will explain it, but only to you.

     KALAN
     If you will not explain it, then transmit the code.

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry.

     KALAN
     You claim to love knowledge, yet when you find something you don't
     like, you demand that we change to please you.

     DANIEL
     No, it is not to please me. You are an incredibly advanced society.
     Why can't you find a better way to educate your people?

     KALAN
     There is no better way than the Averium.

     DANIEL
     Even if that means giving up your son?

     KALAN
     It was the happiest day of my life when Tomin was selected to be
     Urrone. I knew, even before he was born, that he would make an
     incredible contribution to our society.

     DANIEL
     And you never once thought otherwise.

     KALAN
     Not once! And neither did Tomin.

     DANIEL
     And what if Merrin does?

     KALAN
     Merrin...is one of only a few Urrone children. And the only one to
     have spent ten years learning the naquada technology. Without her
     Averium, the people who are awaiting her knowledge to continue their
     research, they will have to wait twelve years for another Urrone to
     learn.

     DANIEL
     Well I didn't know that.

     KALAN
     Merrin does. She does not question her duty. It is you, Dr. Jackson,
     who are misguided to think you can convince her otherwise.

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [Carter is still attempting to get her reactor to work.]

     CARTER
     Come on! Why, why, why aren't you working?

   [An airman enters the laboratory with Merrin.]

     AIRMAN
     She insisted on seeing you, Major.

     CARTER
     It's all right, thanks.

   [As the Airman leaves, Merrin walks over to Carter.]

     CARTER
     Hey.

     MERRIN
     Major Carter, I need your assistance. You must tell General Hammond
     to let me return to Orban.

   [Carter looks unwilling.]

     MERRIN
     I thought as a scientist you would understand.

     CARTER
     Merrin, you're only eleven. Half the interesting things in my life
     didn't happen until I turned fifteen.

     MERRIN
     What kind of interesting things?

     CARTER

     (awkwardly)
     Oh, just, er...stuff.

     MERRIN
     If it were possible, I would give you one of my nanites. And then
     you would know that it's all right.

     CARTER
     Thank you, but I don't think that would make a difference.

     MERRIN

     (about the reactor)
     You are finished.

     CARTER
     Almost. Once I ran a computer simulation based on your sketches, I
     thought I could adapt the design to my materials. But the current is
     being diverted before it reaches the core. I think the shielding
     might be diverting power.

   [Merrin looks at the reactor and attempts to give Carter the solution.]

     MERRIN
     M-Major Carter, I...

     CARTER
     Unless, hey hey hey, the trinium is absorbing the current.

     MERRIN
     Correct, but...

   [Carter cuts her off.]

     CARTER
     Wait, wait, sorry, let me. Ok, by reversing the polarity...

   [She fiddles with the reactor and it starts up.]

     CARTER
     That's it! We're in business.

     MERRIN
     Why wouldn't you let me give you the solution?

     CARTER
     What would have been the fun in that?

     MERRIN
     Fun?

     CARTER
     Well yeah. Figuring something out on my own, especially if it's been
     eluding me a while. It's far more satisfying than having the answer
     given to me.

     MERRIN
     But not as efficient.

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill knocks on Hammond's door.]

     HAMMOND
     Come in.

   [O'Neill pauses when he sees Kalan and Daniel sitting before Hammond.]

     O'NEILL
     You wanted to see me, sir?

     HAMMOND
     Kalan has come to escort Merrin back to Orban. Before you say
     anything, know that I've already granted his request.

     DANIEL
     I don't like it either, Jack, but...you don't know the effect this
     is having on the Orbanians.

     O'NEILL
     What about the effect it's having on Merrin?

     KALAN
     Your Dr. Jackson has come to realise Merrin's importance to her
     people.

     O'NEILL
     Her importance as a vegetable?

     HAMMOND
     Colonel!

   [Kalan stands to face O'Neill.]

     KALAN
     If you would try to understand...

     O'NEILL
     No! I won't. The way you treat your children is absurd. You don't
     deserve them.

     HAMMOND

     (standing)
     Colonel O'Neill!

     O'NEILL

     (to Hammond)
     Request permission to be excused, sir.

   [He leaves Hammond's office without waiting for a reply.]

   INT--SGC, LABORATORY

   [Carter is preparing to start up her reactor.]

     CARTER
     Ok, clear?

   [Carter and Merrin put on goggles to shield their eyes. The reactor
   lets out a burst of energy, setting off the Base alarms.]

     CARTER
     We did it! I'm gonna record these readings.

   [O'Neill enters the laboratory.]

     O'NEILL
     What the heck was that?

     MERRIN
     The reactor worked.

   [The telephone rings and Carter answers it. O'Neill gestures for Merrin
   to leave the room with him.]

     CARTER

     (into the phone)
     Carter. Yes, sir, we're fine. Yeah, it was just the reactor. No,
     sir, just an initial energy pulse. There's no threat to the base.

   INT--SGC, CORRIDOR

     O'NEILL

     (to the Airman escorting Merrin)
     It's all right, Airman, I got it.

   [O'Neill and Merrin enter the elevator.]

     MERRIN
     You are taking me to the surface?

     O'NEILL
     Yes. Look, you came here to learn right? There's something I have to
     show you, but I have to take you off the base for it.

     MERRIN
     You do not have permission, do you?

     O'NEILL
     No, I don't.

   INT--SGC, Hammond's OFFICE

   [Hammond is on the phone to Carter.]

     HAMMOND

     (into the phone)
     In the future Major, before you activate any device that includes
     the word reactor, I would appreciate it if you would notify me.

     CARTER

     (over the phone)
     Of course, sir, it won't happen again.

     HAMMOND
     Good. Now, I'd like you to bring Merrin to my office.

     CARTER

     (in her laboratory)
     Oh, uh, Colonel O'Neill just left with her.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you Major.

   [He dials another number.]

     HAMMOND

     This is Hammond. If Colonel O'Neill attempts to leave, you're
     ordered to...
     (he pauses as the other person speaks)
     How long ago?
     (he waits for the reply)
     I see.

   [He replaces the receiver and looks across at Daniel and Kalan.]

   EXT--EARTH, SCHOOL PLAYGROUND (DAY)

   [O'Neill and Merrin walk over to the school playground.]

     MERRIN
     This is a school?

     O'NEILL
     Part of it. We call this the playground.

     MERRIN
     What is it for?

   [The school bell rings.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, just watch.

   [School children start pouring out of the building.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the children)
     Bambinos! Pizzeria! Mama Mia!

   [A group of children run over to them.]

     KID
     Colonel Jack, what are you doing here?

     O'NEILL
     Playing hooky. Kids, I want you to meet my friend. Her name's
     Merrin. Think you can show her around while I talk to Mrs. Struble?

   [The kids take Merrin away to play. One throws a ball to her, but she
   doesn't catch it.]

     MRS. STRUBLE
     Colonel O'Neill! The kids have been asking when you're coming back
     to see us. How's Cassandra enjoying Junior High?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, she's doing fine. She loves it. Listen, do you have room for
     another student this afternoon?

   [Merrin is still playing with the other children, this time attempting
   to catch the ball.]

     O'NEILL

     (referring to Merrin)
     She's visiting, from out of town.

     MRS. STRUBLE
     Well, we have art scheduled after recess.

     O'NEILL
     That's perfect.

   INT--SCHOOL, ART ROOM

   [Merrin is examining the blue paint on her paintbrush.]

     MRS. STRUBLE
     Your assignment is to paint something you love. Now, it could be a
     person, or an object. Just use your imaginations.

   [Merrin, uncertain, looks around to see what the other children are
   doing. O'Neill is wandering around the room, looking at what the other
   children have drawn. He sees a picture one girl has painted of him.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering to the girl)
     I look fat.

   [She giggles.]

     MERRIN
     Colonel O'Neill?

   [He walks over to see that Merrin has painted a picture of the naquada
   reactor.]

     MERRIN
     This brush is too wide to accurately render the wires.

   [He tears off the picture and crumples it into a ball.]

     O'NEILL
     Ok, let's try this again. Something you love. Something that's not a
     machine, ok? Remember those flowers in Major Carter's lab? The ones
     on the desk? Paint one of those. Go ahead.

   [Merrin starts to paint a picture in the corner of her paper.]

     O'NEILL
     Bigger. Big.

   [The other children have drawn their pictures when O'Neill returns to
   check on Merrin's progress. She has drawn the outer leaves of the
   plant.]

     MERRIN
     There's no purple.

     O'NEILL
     Use red.

     MERRIN
     If I could have another cup, I could mix the blue with the red...

     O'NEILL
     Make the flower red.

     MERRIN

     (becoming irritated)
     Those flowers were purple. You ask me to draw a flower, but you do
     not give me the means to do this accurately.

     O'NEILL
     Merrin, listen to me. It doesn't have to be exact. Paint me a
     flower! I don't care what it looks like. Here use this.

   [He takes away her brush and hands her a bigger one.]

     O'NEILL
     And don't stop with one. Paint the whole garden.

     MERRIN
     But...

     O'NEILL

     (cutting her off)
     Ah! Paint.

   [Merrin starts to paint once more. After the class has finished and the
   other children have gone, Merrin takes her picture to show O'Neill. She
   has drawn a picture full of plants and trees and a matchstick figure in
   one corner.]

     O'NEILL

     Nice.
     (He sees the stick figure)
     Who's that?

     MERRIN
     It's a representation of Major Carter.

     O'NEILL
     Of course it is.

     MERRIN
     Is it right?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. It's way more than right.

     MERRIN
     Thank you Colonel O'Neill, for teaching this to me.

     O'NEILL
     You're welcome... Merrin, all you have to do is ask. I'll find a way
     to make it happen.

     MERRIN
     I have a duty to my people. My knowledge is important to them. You
     did promise.

   INT--SGC, CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Hammond, with Merrin, are heading for the control room.]

     CARTER
     Unfortunately, the test used up the last of naquada, but we'll find
     more.

     HAMMOND
     At least we've got a working prototype. Colonel?

   [O'Neill is waiting for them in the Control Room.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Hammond)
     I'm not here to cause trouble, sir.

     MERRIN
     Colonel O'Neill?

     O'NEILL

     (to Merrin)
     I have something for you.

   [He gives her a box of crayons.]

     MERRIN
     They're beautiful. Thank you. You are mad at me for not staying.

     O'NEILL
     No. No I'm not.

     MERRIN
     Then you understand?

   [He doesn't reply.]

     HAMMOND
     Major Carter, please take Merrin down to the Gate room. I'll be
     there momentarily.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [Carter leads Merrin away.]

     HAMMOND

     (to O'Neill)
     You've already given me more than enough reason for a court martial.

     O'NEILL
     General, for a few hours today I got to show that little girl how to
     be a kid. You want to punish me? Go ahead.

   [Hammond walks away.]

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel and Teal'c watch as Carter hands Kalan the naquadah reactor and
   Merrin gives him the crayons. Hammond enters as Kalan and Merrin walk
   up the ramp towards the open Stargate. They stop and look back to the
   Gate room. Merrin makes a sign with her hands and bows.]

     MERRIN
     On behalf of the citizens of Orban, I'd like to thank you for the
     experience you have given me and my people. I have learned much in
     my time here.

   [O'Neill watches from the control room as she speaks.]

     CARTER
     So have we.

   [Before entering the wormhole, Merrin turns back and smiles at
   O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

   [SG-1 enters the control room.]

     HAMMOND
     We just received a transmission from Orban. Kalan asked for all of
     you to go there right away.

     DANIEL
     Something wrong?

     HAMMOND
     You'll find out when you get there.

   INT--ORBAN, GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 walk out of the Stargate into the Gate room. Kalan is waiting for
   them.]

     KALAN
     Thank you for coming.

     DANIEL
     What's wrong?

     KALAN

     (excited)
     Oh, nothing is wrong. I will show you.

   [He hurries out, leaving SG-1 to follow.]

   EXT--ORBAN, CHILDREN'S HOME (DAY)

   [A child is playing hopscotch. Former Urrone children are laughing and
   playing everywhere.]

     KALAN
     Come. Look. Isn't it wonderful?

   [Tomin is skipping with two other children. Kalan interrupts them in
   order to introduce Tomin to O'Neill.]

     KALAN
     Colonel O'Neill, this is my son Tomin. I am teaching him. All of the
     past Urrone children will now learn, in the old fashioned way, as
     you might say. He will know all that you have done for Orban.

   [He takes out a piece of paper.]

     KALAN
     Oh and I drew this for you, to express my gratitude.

   [He hands the paper to O'Neill. It is a picture of a matchstick figure
   with blond hair.]

     CARTER
     Isn't that...?

     KALAN
     Me!

     DANIEL
     Kalan, when did all this start?

     KALAN
     Last night, after Merrin's Averium.

     CARTER
     She must have known this would happen once her nanites were
     transferred.

     O'NEILL
     This...is what she learned.

   [Carter sees Merrin drawing on a nearby wall.]

     CARTER

     (gesturing to Merrin)
     Colonel.

   [As O'Neill heads over to Merrin, Teal'c bends down before Tomin, who
   touches his tattoo in curiosity. O'Neill comes to stand by Merrin. She
   continues to draw with the crayons he gave her.]

     O'NEILL
     Hi Merrin.

   [Merrin looks up, but shows no sign of recognising him. O'Neill sits
   down beside her.]

     O'NEILL
     Ok. I guess we'll just have to get to know one another all over
     again.

   [He takes a crayon and starts to draw. Merrin smiles and scribbles it
   out.]

     O'NEILL
     You're right. What was I thinking? You ever seen a dog? Dog's are my
     favourite people. Some have tails, some don't. I like that about
     dogs.
