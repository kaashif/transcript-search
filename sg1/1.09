   TEASER

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [People dressed in colorful togas walk around a small orange building
   with columns.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [A young man, Alekos, dressed in a purple toga with a wreath of leaves
   around his head pleads before a statue.]

     ALEKOS
     Give them strength, Lord. Let their hearts beat as one.

   [The statue seems to be made of stone; a Greek-like warrior standing in
   a chariot resting between two winged horses. He is holding a lightning
   bolt, as if about to throw it. There is a noise, and Alekosstares at
   the statue in disbelief. Beyond the statue is a Stargate with six
   chevrons lit. The seventh chevron lights up, and the Stargate
   activates.Alekos runs, looking panicked. Teal'c, Daniel, O'Neill and
   Carter stand on a platform in front of the Stargate, surveying the
   room. It appears to be some kind of temple. They walk down the steps
   toward the statue. O'Neill waves an arm, gesturing to the statue.]

     O'NEILL
     And who might this be, Daniel?

     DANIEL
     I'm not sure...Maybe early Greek, but I don't recognize the god
     form.

   [As Teal'c passes the column where Alekos hides, he peers out.
   Somewhere in the temple, a woman screams.Alekos jumps, disappearing
   around the column. O'Neill and Daniel, Carter and Teal'c turn. As
   O'Neill directs his team with hand gestures, Teal'c takes point, and
   SG-1 move toward the sound. O'Neill and Carter round a column and
   discover Alekos bent over a young woman, obviously in labor. Teal'c and
   Daniel come around on the opposite side, Teal'c pointing his staff
   weapon at the unfortunate couple. The young woman, Thetys, screams in
   fear, and Alekos moves quickly to defend her.]

     DANIEL
     Sorry. We, we...we didn't mean to scare anyone.

   [Alekos looks up at them with fear.]

     ALEKOS
     You are not Pelops.

     DANIEL

     No...no...
     (pointing to the statue)
     Uh, you mean him? Uh, no. We're, we're visitors...friends.

   [Thetys pants, obviously in pain.]

   THETYS
   Husband, the child is near. Please...</blockquote>

     ALEKOS

     (panicked)
     The midwife is gone, I...I do not know the birthing mysteries. And
     the village is too far. Please? Help us.

   [Daniel and Teal'c look from the couple to Carter. O'Neill motions
   Carter toward the woman. Carter looks back at them.]

     CARTER
     What? Well, don't look at me, I don't know what to do.

   [Thetys screams again as SG-1 looks on with shock.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [Daniel is bent over Thetys, who is in the midst of giving birth.
   Holding her hand and wincing, Carter sits beside her, watching Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (concentrating)
     Push. Push. Push.

   [Thetys groans, pants and pushes.]

     DANIEL
     You're doing just fine.

     CARTER
     Where did you learn how to do this?

     DANIEL
     Uh...Uh, on a dig in the Yucatan. Um, after the first one, I made
     friends with the local midwives and they taught me a lot.

     CARTER
     How many babies have you delivered?

     DANIEL

     Uh...two. (looking uncomfortable)
     Uh, counting today.

   [Carter's eyes widen, but she turns back to encourage Thetys in her
   breathing. Across the temple, O'Neill is pacing in front of the
   Stargate whileAlekos sits, looking uneasy, on a platform nearby. Teal'c
   stands by the DHD. All three look up at the cry of a baby. Daniel walks
   out from behind a column, pulling off gloves. They go to meet him.]

     DANIEL
     Alekos...it's a boy.

   [Alekos grabs Daniel by the shoulders and hugs him exuberantly.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, congratulations.

     TEAL'C
     May he grow strong and bring...you...honor.

   [Teal'c's voice trails off as Alekos disappears, running to join
   Thetys.]

     O'NEILL

     (with a smile, to Daniel)
     You never cease to amaze me with all your talents.

     DANIEL

     Thank you.
     (He looks around the temple)
     Wow, this...place is incredible. It's like we just stepped into the
     citadel at Mycenae.

     O'NEILL
     Thought you said it was Greek?

     DANIEL
     Oh, uh...Mycenae was an ancient city in the southern Peloponnesus
     region.

     O'NEILL
     Where's that?

     DANIEL

     (with a slight smile)
     Greece.

     O'NEILL

     (shaking his head)
     Why do I do that?

     Carter (from off-screen)

     Wait, I don't think you should be walking right now, I mean...

   [Alekos and Thetys, carrying the baby walk into view. Carter is walking
   slightly to the side, holding out one arm, as if trying to be there to
   catch the baby if Thetys drops him. Thetys looks perfectly healthy.]

     CARTER
     Shouldn't you be resting? Daniel, shouldn't she...

     THETYS

     (laughing)
     I'm fine. I'm fine. We wish for you all to be the first to see...

   [Thetys holds the baby out towards Daniel and pulls back the blanket
   covering him. On his arm is a small pyramid-shaped mark.]

     DANIEL
     A birthmark.

     ALEKOS

     (embracing his wife and child)
     A tri-point. It will bring him luck.
     (to Daniel)
     I would call him Dan-El, to honor the stranger who birthed him.

     DANIEL
     (awkwardly)
     Oh, you don't have to do that.

     THETYS
     May we offer you the hospitality of our village?

     O'NEILL
     Well, that'd be nice. Who are you folks?

     ALEKOS
     We are the Chosen.

     TEAL'C

     (suspiciously)
     Where do the gods reside?

   [Thetys looks up at Alekos as they both laugh.]

     ALEKOS
     Doesn't everyone know?

   [Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c just look at him.]

     THETYS
     In the sky. Of course.

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     Of course.

   EXT--PLANET (ARGOS)--DAY

   [Alekos holds baby Dan-el up to the sky, displaying him.]

     ALEKOS
     I have a son!

   [Alekos lowers the baby, kisses Thetys and places him in her arms. The
   people of the village, dressed in a colorful array of togas and draped
   cloth, cluster around, patting Alekos and Thetys, praising the baby.]

     CROWD

     Yes!
     Look at him.
     What a lovely child.
     A lovely child.

   [There is joy and celebration as the crowd of villagers chatter with
   each other. They move across the village. The members of SG-1 sit on
   the sides of a fountain in the center of the celebration, observing
   them.]

     DANIEL
     Look at these people. I guess they've never heard the word
     unattractive here.

   [A young woman moves among SG-1, offering them refreshments. Daniel
   takes a piece of fruit.]

     TEAL'C
     They all look as healthy as a Jaffa.

     O'NEILL
     That's a good thing, right?

     Carter
     I don't see anyone who looks like they're over forty.

   [Another woman carries a tray of tall glasses, filled with some sort of
   beverage. Daniel takes one. O'Neill looks across the square as a young
   woman takes Dan-el from Thetys and cradles him. She looks up, and their
   eyes meet. She raises her eyebrows and smiles flirtatiously. O'Neill
   gazes at her.]

     O'NEILL
     Um. Do things feel a little...off...here?

     DANIEL
     Are you crazy? It's a paradise.

     O'NEILL

     (absently)
     Yeah, sure, have an apple. What could happen?

   [O'Neill has kept his eyes on the young woman throughout the entire
   conversation. As he finishes speaking, she approaches, holding a
   covered plate.]

     KYNTHIA
     I am Kynthia. Welcome to our village.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you. Jack O'Neill.

   [Kynthia smiles at him and uncovers the dish to reveal a fancy cake.
   She offers it to him. O'Neill takes a piece. Kynthia smiles at him and
   watches as he takes a bite. Daniel looks from O'Neill to the cake with
   curiosity. O'Neill takes a bite and smiles at Kynthia.]

     KYNTHIA

     (anxiously)
     It is pleasing?

     O'NEILL

     (nods)
     Very.
     (to Daniel)
     You should have some.

   [Daniel reaches out to take a piece, but Kynthia pulls the dish away.]

     KYNTHIA

     (to O'Neill, never glancing at Daniel)
     It is only for you.

   [Beside O'Neill, Carter laughs.]

     O'NEILL

     Only for me?
     (takes the dish, smiles and nods)
     Thanks.

   [Kynthia saunters off, joining a group of young women. They greet her
   with giggles and squeals of delight.]

     DANIEL

     (smirking)
     "It is only for you."

     CARTER

     (grinning)
     I think you have a fan, Colonel.

     TEAL'C
     I believe this woman wishes to spend time with O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     (still eating)
     Thank you, Teal'c.

   [Carter laughs again. O'Neill looks at her; she clears her throat and
   straightens her face.]

     DANIEL
     This place must be loaded with artifacts. That statue in there, for
     example, must be the Mycenaean hero, Pelops, who fought from his
     winged chariot, hurling lightning bolts.

   [In the middle of Daniel's speech, O'Neill blinks. While watching
   Kynthia with her friends, his vision blurs.]

     CARTER
     Poetic way to describe a Goa'uld Death Glider.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, probably.

     TEAL'C
     These people are obviously not laborers.

   [O'Neill holds the plate away from his body, chewing thoughtfully,
   seeming to admire his reflection in the shiny surface.]

     TEAL'C
     I must wonder why a Goa'uld would bring them to this planet. Perhaps
     it was a good Goa'uld.

   [O'Neill lets out a shout of laughter, spraying pieces of the cake.
   Daniel looks at him, nonplussed.]

     O'NEILL

     (chortles, his mouth full)
     Right! Like there is such a thing.

   [Teal'c raises one eyebrow. Daniel stares at O'Neill.]

     TEAL'C
     I did not intend for my statement to be humorous.

     O'NEILL

     (with amusement, around a mouthful of food)
     Trust me, they weren't.

   [A giggling group of Kynthia's friends surround O'Neill, pulling him to
   his feet.]

     O'NEILL

     (fatuously)
     Hello, girls...

   [O'Neill seems happy as the girls lead him away. Carter jumps to her
   feet.]

     CARTER
     Uh, Colonel? Where're you going? Hello?

   [Daniel and Teal'c also rise, equally concerned. Several Argosians
   approach them, catching at their clothing and patting them soothingly.]

     MAN
     Please, sit down.

   [Across from them, O'Neill is settled on a bench and the girls
   disappear into one of the buildings. Carter, Daniel and Teal'c sit back
   down, several Argosians at their feet. Music starts to play as Kynthia
   comes out wearing a sheer, long, sleeveless robe with butterfly
   attachments and a train. Sticks sewn into the lining rest in her hands;
   she holds them up and crossed in front of her, so that the material
   hides her face. Several young women carry the trailing edges of the
   robe, spreading them out and setting them down as Kynthia comes to a
   halt in front of O'Neill. Several voices from the crowd cry out.]

     VOICES

     Ah.
     She is beautiful!
     Yes.

   [Kynthia stands in front of O'Neill. As the people quiet, the music
   gets louder and she begins dancing. She holds the sticks out to the
   sides, swaying and twirling for O'Neill, who stares at her, mesmerized,
   his vision blurring.]

   [As the music gets faster, Kynthia twirls and, for O'Neill, the world
   around her blurs; he can see only her. Kynthia bends down before him,
   wrapping the wings of her dress around him, close enough to kiss. He
   stares at her. Kynthia stands and pulls the unresisting O'Neill behind
   her, leading him into one of the buildings. The villagers laugh and
   exclaim their appreciation.]

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Carter rise to their feet. Alekos approaches them.]

     ALEKOS
     Unto every man the creator gives one hundred blissful days. It is a
     sin not to celebrate each and every one.

   [Alekos hands one of the goblets he is carrying to Carter. She looks at
   it suspiciously.]

     DANIEL

     A hundred day celebration?
     (inhales)
     Guess we should pace ourselves.

   INT--VILLAGE--EVENING

   [O'Neill and Kynthia lie on a bed, wrapped around each other, kissing
   passionately. Suddenly, O'Neill stops and pulls back, looking a bit
   confused.]

     O'NEILL
     What, exactly, just happened?

   [Kynthia smiles up at him, just as a gentle kind of alarm begins to
   sound. People stream into the building. Alekos, Thetys and Dan-el among
   them. Surprised, O'Neill sits up, pulling a covering over his naked
   body. No one pays any attention to him, instead lying down to sleep.
   O'Neill turns to ask Kynthia a question, but she is asleep.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering)
     Kynthia?
     (urgently)
     Kynthia?

   [O'Neill feels her neck for a pulse, then puts his head on her chest to
   listen for a heartbeat. Apparently, she has one. O'Neill grabs a
   blalnket from the bed to wrap around his nakedness while he looks
   around the room. He walks away from the bed, seeing Argosians lying in
   deep sleep all around the room, some on beds, some on pillows, some
   propped in uncomfortable positions on the floor. Carter, Teal'c and
   Daniel walk into the building.]

     O'NEILL

     (confused)
     Um...what happened?

     CARTER

     (looking at O'Neill)
     To them or...you?

   [Teal'c passes her to look at the sleepers.]

     O'NEILL

     (avoiding her eyes)
     We'll talk about that later.

     CARTER
     I've seen parties end abruptly, but never like this.

   [Carter bends over to observe Thetys and Dan-el. She feels for a pulse
   in Thetys's neck.]

     DANIEL
     They all just...collapsed.

     TEAL'C
     It happened just as the sun set.

     O'NEILL
     Kynthia did the same thing. What is it? Some kind of sleeping
     sickness? What?

     CARTER
     No sign of fever or pain. Breathing's shallow, heartbeats slow but
     regular. A disease can't affect everyone all at once.

     TEAL'C
     It seems to be nothing more than a deep state of sleep.

     CARTER

     (eyeing O'Neill)
     Now...how about you?

     O'NEILL

     (evasively)
     Let's just stick to the matter at hand. How does an entire village
     pass out? Something in the food?

   [O'Neill drinks from one of the goblets. Teal'c walks to him.]

     TEAL'C
     We all partook of the same food.

     CARTER
     Except for that cake.

     DANIEL

     (slowly)
     Which was "only for you."

   [O'Neill looks at Daniel, then down at the goblet in his hand with
   dismay. He throws it aside.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn. She drugged me.

   [O'Neill jumps up, passing Carter to walk toward Kynthia on the bed. He
   only takes a few steps before staggering and falling to his knees.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa!

   [Only a few paces behind, Carter catches him, Daniel pushes past her
   and grabs O'Neill on the other side to save him from falling face-first
   into the floor.]

     DANIEL
     Oh...he's still feeling the effects of the drug.

     O'NEILL
     No...just a little tired.

     CARTER
     Colonel...?

     O'NEILL
     From now on, we stick to rations.

   [O'Neill passes out. Carter and Daniel lower him to the ground. Carter
   sighs.]

     CARTER
     No fever, shallow breathing, slow heartbeat...just like the others.

     DANIEL
     What the hell is going on here?

   EXT--ARGOS--MORNING

   [Teal'c looks around at the village, once again bustling with activity.
   Daniel is talking with several villagers, Carter writing in a notebook
   as O'Neill, looking rather bedraggled and hung over, comes out of the
   building. He pulls on his sunglasses on, staggering past her.]

     CARTER

     (eagerly)
     Hey, Colonel...how you feeling?

     O'NEILL

     (walking)
     Hung over--but okay.
     (He removes his sunglasses as he walks past Daniel.)
     Getting any answers out here?

   [O'Neill bends over the village fountain and plunges his head under the
   water. Daniel and Carter, behind him, share a look.]

     DANIEL
     No. They all act as if what happened last night was normal. They
     party until sundown, then they fall asleep, and they wake when the
     sun rises.

     O'NEILL
     I'd like an explanation. Daniel, get back to that temple. See what
     you can find out, and take Teal'c with you.

   [Daniel stands, looking at him.]

     O'NEILL
     Go on.

   [Daniel walks away, Teal'c following him. O'Neill lays sideways on the
   edge of the well.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter. Keep asking questions out here.

   [O'Neill puts his sunglasses back on and falls back flat on his back,
   showing no intention of moving. Carter shakes her head uncertainly,
   looking around at the villagers.]

   EXT--ARGOS--DAY

     Villagers chatter and walk in groups around the buildings.

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [Daniel and Alekos walk around the statue in the center of the temple.
   Daniel is using his videorecorder to tape everything.]

     ALEKOS
     He is the creator. Pelops, the giver of days. This was his home when
     he lived among us. We keep it as it was then and will do so until he
     returns.

     DANIEL
     And when will that be?

     ALEKOS
     Well, that is a mystery. Until it is revealed, it is the duty of the
     Chosen to rejoice and wait.

     TEAL'C
     Why are your people called the Chosen?

   [Alekos waves his arm toward a mural on the wall.]

     ALEKOS
     My ancestors were so beloved by Pelops that he fashioned this garden
     for us. It is said he chose us and brought us here from beyond the
     stars.

     DANIEL
     Are there any writings of your history?

     ALEKOS

     (confused)
     Writings? I do not know this word.

     DANIEL

     Ahh...(looks around the temple)
     More...(turns and indicates the symbols on the base of the statue)
     ...of this. Writings. Do you know what this is?

     ALEKOS
     It is of Pelops.

     TEAL'C
     It is Goa'uld. An obscure dialect.

   [Daniel stares at Teal'c with awe and maybe a hint of impatience. He
   steps in closer.]

     DANIEL
     Why didn't you tell me that before?

     TEAL'C
     You never before inquired.

     DANIEL
     Well...you call it Goa'uld. Um, I call it linear A script. We found
     pictographics like this in ancient Greece and ancient Cretan, but we
     never completely deciphered this form.

     TEAL'C
     The symbols are a sequence.

     DANIEL
     What, like a...combination?

   [Teal'c squats at the base of the statue and begins pressing the
   symbols in a seemingly random order.]

     TEAL'C
     What is a combination?

     DANIEL
     Well, it's a sequence of symbols or motions...

   [Daniel's voice trails off as Teal'c's actions cause one of the symbols
   to slide out; opening like a drawer to reveal an embedded small
   triangular tablet and a Goa'uld device. Teal'c picks them up as Daniel
   stares; his mouth works, but nothing coming out.]

   [Teal'c stands and passes the stone over the face of the tablet. Daniel
   moves closer to observe and even Alekos looks curious. Teal'c's action
   causes the symbols on the tablet to change.]

     DANIEL
     Can you read this?

     TEAL'C
     I believe I can. It seems to be some sort of record. An archaic
     dialect. Very difficult to decipher.

   EXT--A BEACH NEAR THE VILLAGE--DAY

   [Carter is collecting samples. Several children are playing nearby.]

     CHILD #1
     Come on, I want to show you something.

     CHILD #2
     Okay, I...I'm coming.

   [Thetys approaches, carrying a small boy who looks about two. Carter
   rises to her feet, smiling.]

     CARTER
     Hi. I found this shell this morning and, uh, thought maybe Dan-el
     might like it.

   [Thetys puts the child down as Carter shakes the shell, producing a
   gentle sound.]

     CARTER
     He can use it as a rattle. You want to give it to him for me?

     THETYS
     Oh, you can do so yourself. This is Dan-el.

   [Thetys brushes back the little boy's hair. He looks up at her and
   smiles.]

     CARTER
     No, no, I meant the baby.

     THETYS
     This is baby Dan-el.

   [Carter frowns as she looks down at Dan-el and notices the triangular
   birthmark on his arm.]

   EXT--ARGOS--DAY

   [DAN-EL, the birthmark showing prominently, is seated between Carter
   and THETYS on the edge of the well. O'Neill stands over them, still
   wearing his sunglasses.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay...that's not possible

     THETYS

     (confused)
     Do you not have children who change and...and grow?

     O'NEILL
     Well, yeah, sure we do. But not like that.

     CARTER
     Thetys, how old is that boy?

   [Carter points to a nearby youth talking with two girls.]

     THETYS
     That is Phillippos. He is twelve.

     CARTER
     Okay, well, he's a little big for twelve years old, but...

     THETYS

     (confused)
     Years...what are years?

     CARTER
     Oh. Uh, well...uh, I-I guess it would be a little different for each
     planet, but a year is basically the time it takes for the globe to
     complete one orbit around the sun...

     O'NEILL

     (rolling his eyes)
     Right...let's just keep this keep this simple, okay? Where we come
     from, there are 365 days in one year.

     THETYS
     No, no. We...we have no such counting of time on Argos. Phillippos
     is twelve days old.

   [O'Neill and Carter look at each other in shock.]

     CARTER
     What...? How old are you?

     THETYS
     Twenty-one days.

     O'NEILL

     (cautiously)
     And, um...Kynthia?

     THETYS
     Thirty-one days.

   [Carter blinks. O'Neill looks stunned.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Carter are sitting on the floor near the statue,
   talking.]

     DANIEL
     I think Pelops brought humans here to be lab rats. From what we've
     been able to translate so far he wanted to know how humans evolve,
     so he shortened the life span to about 1/250th of normal.

     CARTER
     So, instead of having to wait a hundred thousand years to see how
     human physiology evolves, he could do it in a hundred?

     TEAL'C
     That is correct. Pelops wanted to determine what the human host body
     would become in the future, and perhaps accelerate the process.

     CARTER
     Well, how did he do it? Was it genetic alteration, or...?

     TEAL'C
     We do not know. It is an archaic dialect.

   [Daniel stares down at the papers in his lap, avoiding Carter's eyes.
   He looks upset.]

     CARTER
     Daniel...?

     DANIEL
     Okay. I didn't want to say this 'til I was absolutely sure but...I
     think he may have created some kind of virus. And...viruses are
     often spread through bodily contact.

     CARTER

     (quickly)
     Some are, and some are airborne.

     DANIEL
     But I think that this one isn't.

     TEAL'C
     What has drawn you to this conclusion?

     DANIEL
     Because only one of us passed out last night, and that was Jack.

   [Teal'c raises one eyebrow thoughtfully. Carter rests her forehead on
   her steepled hands before looking back at Daniel.]

   EXT--VILLAGE--TWILIGHT

   [SG-1 walk into the village, returning from the temple. As usual, the
   village is bustling with happy activity.]

     DANIEL
     You have to give them credit for one thing...they do enjoy life.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps it is because they do not have much life to enjoy.

     O'NEILL
     Great. So now what you're telling me is this virus--which, by the
     way, I do NOT have--is deadly?

     DANIEL
     Well, if the kids age five years in five days, what happens when
     they reach a hundred days?

   [O'Neill staggers and drops to his knees. Carter drops down beside him
   while Daniel and Teal'c look on with shock.]

     CARTER
     Colonel? Colonel?

   [She rolls O'Neill over onto his back, his head on her thigh as she
   removes his sunglasses. Around the village, everyone is dropping where
   they stood, lying down as the sun sets.]

     O'NEILL

     (groggy)
     I guess it wasn't the cake.

     CARTER
     Maybe it was your physical contact with Kynthia.

     O'NEILL
     Get back to Earth, Captain. Figure this thing out.

   INT--SGC LAB

   [Carter is bent over a computer, an isolation container to the side.
   Fraiser walks into the lab.]

     FRAISER
     Tell me you brought the blood back in sealed containers.

     CARTER
     Yeah, of course I did. What is it?

     FRAISER

     (sighing)
     I'm not sure. First, I ran a routine check for antibodies...nothing.
     So then I thought, all right, maybe this alien bug found a way to
     hide from the immune system, so I ran a protein analysis.

   [Fraiser pulls a disk out of her pocket and hands it to Carter.]

     FRAISER
     Take a look what I found.

   [Carter puts the disk in the computer. The screen changes to show blood
   samples and data.]

     FRAISER
     All right, these are the blood samples you brought back. Now, look
     at the strange particulate in there.

   [Fraiser magnifies the picture and points to a couple small
   triangular-shaped objects moving in the blood sample.]

     CARTER
     So that's from one of the Argosians?

   [Fraiser nods, and Carter nods. FRAISER presses a key on the keyboard.
   The blood sample changes but stays at the same magnification; in this
   particular sample, dozens of small triangles move around in the blood.]

     FRAISER
     Now...That's from Colonel O'Neill.

     CARTER
     Wow...what is it?

     FRAISER
     Something we don't have a word for. Yet.

     CARTER
     Well, how come the Colonel has way more of it than the Argosians?

     FRAISER
     Maybe because he started out older than they did, sort of like a...a
     head start for whatever this thing is.

     CARTER
     I'd better wake up General Hammond.

     FRAISER
     Yeah.

   [Carter leaves the lab as Fraiser starts working on the computer.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [The Stargate activates. Daniel runs down the stairs away from it,
   toward a doorway on the other side of the temple.]

     DANIEL
     Jack! Carter's coming back!

   [Daniel runs into the entry corridor and waits as O'Neill approaches.]

     DANIEL
     Jack.

   [As Daniel motions over his shoulder, O'Neill joins him. Daniel
   observes him with concern. O'Neill's hairline has receded and his
   grayer hair seems slightly longer. He appears to be hunched over a bit,
   and has more wrinkles.]

   [Carter comes through the wormhole carrying a large container. She
   slows as she sees O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Welcome back, Captain. So, what did you find out?

   [Carter stares at him, her mouth open.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on now, don't keep the elderly waiting. It's rude.

   [Carter puts the case down, frowning at his altered appearance.]

     CARTER
     It isn't a virus.

     O'NEILL
     All right, what is it?

     CARTER
     Well, Dr. Fraiser and I came up empty. She's still working on it.
     But it's going to take time.

     DANIEL
     Time...is something these people don't have, Captain.

   [They all look uncomfortable.]

     O'NEILL
     Nor do I.

     CARTER
     Colonel, there's something else. Your blood sample showed way more
     organisms compared to the Argosians.

     O'NEILL
     How many more?

     CARTER
     Maybe on the level of a hundred times more...and they are
     multiplying.

     O'NEILL
     Which means?

     CARTER
     It...it means the organism, or what ever it is, seems to be
     compensating for your natural age. You've already lived way longer
     than anyone with this--for lack of a better word, disease--ever
     should.

     O'NEILL

     (impatient)
     Cut to it, Captain.

     CARTER

     (reluctantly)
     At the rate you're changing, by the end of two weeks, you'll be the
     equivalent of one hundred years old.

     O'NEILL
     So, in two weeks I'll be dead?

     CARTER
     Not if I can help it. I'd like to set up a lab here.

     O'NEILL
     Negative, Captain.

     CARTER
     We may be able to retard the aging process long enough to find a
     cure.

     O'NEILL
     I want you to pack up and head back to Earth. Now. All of you.
     That's an order. We're not going to bring another disease back
     through that Gate.

     TEAL'C
     I will remain here, with O'Neill. I cannot be affected by...whatever
     this is.

     O'NEILL
     I don't need company. I need a cure. And Daniel needs help
     translating that Goa'uld tablet thing. It might hold the answer.

     DANIEL
     Jack...

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     And don't you dare say good-bye, because you damn will better be
     coming back...soon. Now, get out of here. All of you.

   [O'Neill walks away, leaving his teammates staring after him with
   concern and determination.]

   INT--SGC LAB--DAY?

   [Carter is looking at magnified images of the blood samples on a
   computer. Fraiser is working with some test tubes and beakers on a
   table nearby. Teal'c and Daniel are in the observation deck above.]

     CARTER
     My God...

     FRAISER

     (joining her)
     What?

     CARTER
     They're not multiplying. They're replicating.

     DANIEL

     (via PA system)
     What's the difference?

     CARTER
     Living organisms multiply. Machines replicate.

     TEAL'C

     (on PA)
     Machines inside the body? How is that possible?

     CARTER
     They're molecular devices that take atomic particles from their
     environment and use them to make more of themselves.

     FRAISER
     Well, you're talking nanotechnology!

   [Carter nods.]

     DANIEL

     (on PA)
     You know anything about that?

     FRAISER

     No.
     (she sighs)

     CARTER
     Yes! When I was at the Pentagon, I worked for a year with a group
     that studied nanotechnology. We were looking at it for a lot of
     different uses; one of them was medicine. Creating artificial immune
     systems, repairing individual cells...even manipulating DNA to stop
     the aging process.

     FRAISER
     It sounds like Pelops succeeded in what you were experimenting with,
     only in reverse. Nice guy.

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [O'Neill sits in the temple, glaring at the statue of Pelops. There is
   a fire roaring in a vessel and he is sitting in what appears to be
   Pelops' throne. He appears to have aged several more years.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the statue)
     What're you looking at? Think you're hot stuff, doing this to me
     from six billion light years away?

     KYNTHIA

     (peeking out from behind the statue)
     Can you really talk to the great Pelops?

     O'NEILL
     Sure...why not? Just a piece of rock. Not so great, anyway.

   [Kynthia looks around the temple then approaches him, looking at
   O'Neill with awe and sympathy.]

     KYNTHIA
     Your people...they have gone?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah...they've gone.

     KYNTHIA
     Then, you will leave also?

     O'NEILL
     No, I'll be here for a while.

     KYNTHIA

     (sounding delighted)
     I am glad.

   [Kynthia settles on the pillows at O'Neill's feet, placing one hand on
   his knee.]

     KYNTHIA
     I would like to learn of your customs.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe some other time, huh? I've kinda got a lot on my mind.

     KYNTHIA
     But you ate the marriage cake...came to my bed...

     O'NEILL

     (shocked)
     Marriage cake?
     (Kynthia nods.)
     Kynthia, you thought we were married?

     KYNTHIA

     (looking slightly worried)
     By all our customs, yes.

   [O'Neill closes his eyes as he looks away Kynthia's confusion.]

     O'NEILL

     Sweet...
     (sighs)
     Kynthia, wh-what you were feeling wasn't really love. That takes
     time. I mean, you can't get to know someone in one day.

     KYNTHIA
     Unto every woman the creator gives one hundred blissful days.

     O'NEILL

     (impatiently)
     Kynthia, will you stop that? Your creator was not a god, and he
     certainly didn't give you life. He took it away.

     KYNTHIA
     We are the Chosen. He made this place for us. To be happy...to love.

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     To be experimented on! I mean, look at me! I'm forty years old...or
     I was. That's...thousands and thousands of days.

     KYNTHIA

     (visibly upset)
     You do not tell the truth.

     O'NEILL
     The average human life span is sixty or seventy years. Some people
     live to be one hundred years.

     KYNTHIA

     (crying)
     It is not possible.

     O'NEILL
     Pelops was an alien who used your people! He shortened your lives to
     satisfy his curiosity!

   [Kynthia looks to the statue, then back to O'Neill.]

     KYNTHIA

     (shaking her head, whispering)
     No.

   [Kynthia gets up and runs from the temple. O'Neill watches her flee,
   looking regretful.]

   INT--SGC LAB--DAY?

   [Carter and Fraiser are working on the isolation container. Carter has
   her hands in the gloves that allow her to manipulate objects inside the
   container.]

     CARTER
     We've given the nanocytes some live tissue to interact with, but
     they aren't touching it. The only thing they appear to do is make
     more of themselves. So, how are they causing the aging on Argos?

     FRAISER
     Maybe there's something on Argos that they need to make them do
     another task, something in the air or, uh, in the food.

   [Carter puts down one of the instruments she was holding. As she turns
   her hands over in the gloves, she notices that they appear to be
   disintegrating.]

     CARTER
     Unh!

   [An alarm starts to sound. Carter pulls her hands out quickly and
   closes the doors, isolating the nanocytes inside the container. In the
   observation area, Teal'c and Daniel rise to their feet, looking on with
   concern.]

     TEAL'C

     (over the PA)
     Is there a problem, Captain Carter?

     CARTER
     I-I don't know!

   [She hurries to wash her hands in a sink.]

     FRAISER
     Why, it's eating through the rubber!

   [Inside the isolation chamber, the gloves crumble into small pieces.]

     CARTER
     Oh, God!

     FRAISER
     What? What is it?

     CARTER
     They're trying to spread.

   [Carter and Fraiser look at each other, then up at Daniel and Teal'c.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [O'Neill is still on Pelop's throne. His hair is white, much longer and
   thinning. His face contains more wrinkles, as well as a scraggly
   stubble. His hands are spotted with age and trembling. In them, he has
   a notebook and pen. O'Neill studies the paper, on which is written
   'Dear Sara', but nothing else. Looking troubled, he closes the notebook
   and throws it and the pen to the floor. Alekos, previously unseen,
   speaks.]

     ALEKOS
     Is it true that you have lived...thousands of days?

     O'NEILL
     I should have kept my mouth shut. But wouldn't you rather know the
     truth?

   [Alekos stares at him, open-mouthed, then whirls to look at the statue,
   pleading with it.]

     ALEKOS
     Why do we deserve this?

     O'NEILL
     He can't hear you.

     ALEKOS
     We are good people. We love each other and this land you have given
     us. Why?

     O'NEILL
     Science. Progress. Knowledge...

   [O'Neill waves his hands, at a loss for a better answer.]

     O'NEILL
     Alekos. What would you do if you had thousands of days ahead of you?

     ALEKOS
     I would walk out into the world, beyond the borders of the Chosen.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

   [Alekos sits at O'Neill's feet. He continues, his voice rising with
   excitement.]

     ALEKOS
     To see what is there. Now one knows. Pelops has forbidden us ever to
     leave.

     O'NEILL
     And how has he done that? He's nothing but a big piece of rock. He's
     a statue.

     ALEKOS
     He will strike us down. It is taught.

     O'NEILL
     No, he will not strike you down. Trust me on that, will you? Look;
     go on out there. Take a walk. See what's there. Go on...

   [Alekos looks thoughtful and O'Neill waves him on. He rises slowly to
   his feet.]

     ALEKOS
     Then I could return and teach the people what I know. And in their
     thousands of days, they would learn more and...and teach their
     children.

     O'NEILL

     (smiling)
     Now you're talking!

   EXT--ARGOS, DAWN

   [The sun rises.]

   INT--ARGOS

   [Kynthia walks into the temple, looking for O'Neill. She finds him
   facing away from her, sitting before the Stargate, staring at it. His
   hair is all white now and past his shoulders.]

     KYNTHIA
     Come back to the village. It is not good to be always alone.

     O'NEILL

     (still turned away from her)
     Whatever time I have left, let me spend it in my own way.

   [Kynthia walks up the steps to sit by O'Neill.]

     KYNTHIA
     But you do not spend it. You waste it.

     O'NEILL
     I don't think reflecting on my life, or...trying to figure out how
     to get the rest of it back, is a waste.

     KYNTHIA
     You are angry.

     O'NEILL
     Yes. Yes I am. Aren't you? Now that you know the truth?

     KYNTHIA
     What can we do but live in the way we always have? We do not have
     thousands of days. But we treasure every moment.

     O'NEILL

     I know, Kynthia. But in my heart...I'm a military man, a warrior.
     That's my life.
     (He looks away, his eyes on the past)
     To which my ex-wife will attest.

     KYNTHIA
     You love her still?

   [O'Neill doesn't answer, sitting very still.]

     KYNTHIA

     (sadly)
     And now, because of me, you will never see her again.

     O'NEILL

     (patting her comfortingly)
     You meant no harm.

     KYNTHIA
     Then let me give what I have taken. The time of one heartbeat can
     become eternity.

   [As O'Neill turns to look at her, Kynthia blinks back tears, then bends
   in and kisses O'Neill gently.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond drops a sheaf of papers onto the briefing table as he joins
   SG-1 and Fraiser.]

     HAMMOND
     I'm sorry, people. My decision is final.

     FRAISER
     Sir, neither of us show any evidence of the nanocyte.

     CARTER
     We can keep working here in total isolation.

     HAMMOND
     All blood and tissue samples are to be incinerated and pulverized.
     Work on the Argos project stops now.

     DANIEL

     (restrained, but obviously furious)
     General, you are condemning Colonel O'Neill and the Argosians to
     death.

     HAMMOND
     Captain Carter, these things appear to possess artificial
     intelligence. Correct?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. That's the only way they could adapt their programming to
     their situation.

     HAMMOND
     Which means they could adapt themselves right out of this facility.

     CARTER

     (intently)
     Sir, if we destroy the samples we will have nothing to work from.

     HAMMOND
     I'm sorry. The risk is just too great. The order is final.

   [Hammond rises to leave. Automatically, Carter and Fraiser stand.]

     DANIEL

     (shouting, his voice stressed)
     Sir!

   [Hammond stops. Everyone turns to stare at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     We cannot just leave him there.

     HAMMOND
     Doctor Jackson, Colonel O'Neill is one of the finest men it has ever
     been my pleasure to serve with. It will be a great loss to this
     country and to all of us in this room. But I am sure he would not
     hesitate to make the same decision for himself that I am making now.

   [Hammond walks away. Teal'c looks angry, Carter resigned. Daniel stares
   into space, his face set.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [O'Neill is sitting in front of the Stargate, his team on the view
   screen of what appears to be a very small video communicator.]

     CARTER

     (on the screen)
     We're working with computer simulations and practical simulations.
     Realistically, sir, I'm afraid it might take years.

     DANIEL

     (on the screen)
     The General says that Gate travel to Argos is strictly off-limits
     for the next few, uh, millennia...But we can send objects through,
     so if you need anything...just call.
     (to Teal'c)
     Say something.

     TEAL'C

     (on the screen)
     Colonel...I've learned very much from you. Thank you.

     CARTER

     (on the screen)
     You know, goodbyes really suck.

   [O'Neill'S hands tremble as he studies the faces of his team; he
   doesn't say anything, but hits the button that turns off the power,
   staring at the blank screen.]

   EXT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [The villagers approach the temple, bearing offerings.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [The place their offerings at the base of the statue. O'Neill, with
   long white hair and age spots, hobbles over to Kynthia, Alekos, Thetys
   and Dan-el, who looks about eleven.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me, what are you doing?

     ALEKOS
     Your people do not have enough knowledge to help us. We must ask
     Pelops to return.

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     For crying out loud!

   [O'Neill grabs a dish out of a young man's hands and throws it to the
   ground, where it smashes. The villagers jump.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting)
     Old Pelops doesn't give a rat's ass about things like love! His kind
     kidnap people like you and take them to other worlds to be used as
     slaves!

     ALEKOS

     (in disbelief)
     Pelops thinks of us as his slaves?

   [The villagers looks around at each other, uneasy and worried. O'Neill
   watches as they express their confusion. Alekos hugs Dan-el.]

     ALEKOS
     Then I will no longer be one of the Chosen.

   [The villagers gasp at his statement.]

     THETYS

     (tearfully)
     Nor will I.

     O'NEILL

     (staring at the statue)
     That's the message you ought to be sending.

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [Ropes are wrapped around the statue of Pelops; at the other end, young
   people from the village strain and pull. The statue topples and falls,
   crashing into pieces on the ground. The villagers hug each other in
   fear, waiting to see what will happen. When nothing does, their
   confidence grows.]

     ALEKOS
     He...he did not strike us.

   [There is laughing and much relief. The villagers embrace each other.
   On the sidelines, Kynthia looks up at O'Neill with pride. He pats her
   shoulder, and she puts her hand over his.]

   EXT--ARGOS BEACH--TWILIGHT

   [O'Neill and Kynthia are walking on the water's edge as the sun goes
   down.]

     O'NEILL

     So, you like older men, do you?
     (he turns to Kynthia, as she freezes in place)
     Wh-what is it?

     KYNTHIA

     (fearfully)
     We should go back. We have gone too far from the village. Pelops
     forbids it.

     O'NEILL
     He's gone, Kynthia. He's gone. It'll be okay. Promise.

   [As Kynthia looks at him, O'Neill takes her hand and they continue
   their walk.]

   EXT--ARGOS BEACH--NIGHT

   [O'Neill is playing tic-tac-toe in the sand with Kynthia. He places an
   'O', she puts in an 'X' and draws a line, winning the game.]

     O'NEILL
     Aw, hell. I have to teach you a game I can win.

   [They both laugh.]

     KYNTHIA
     It is good to see you smile. Tell me, will you live the rest of your
     days without making love?

     O'NEILL

     Oh, God, I hope not.
     (he laughs with Kynthia)
     Ah, we'd probably just pass out.

   [O'Neill looks up at the sky, enjoying the air. There's a look of
   dawning realization as it occurs to him that it is dark, and they are
   still awake.]

     O'NEILL
     Why aren't we unconscious yet? It should have happened already,
     Kynthia. Why aren't we asleep?

   EXT--ARGOS--DAY

   [O'Neill and Kynthia arrive at the village. It is daylight, but
   everyone is still fast asleep, lying on the ground.]

     KYNTHIA
     No one has awakened.

     O'NEILL
     Except for us. Why? How important is this rule that no one leave the
     village?

     KYNTHIA
     It is Pelops' first law.

     O'NEILL
     Then whatever it is that knocks us all out at night is right here.

     KYNTHIA
     What?

     O'NEILL

     I'll bet you and I stayed awake because we walked out of range. The
     cure could be as simple as gettin' the hell out of Dodge. We stay
     out of proximity; no sleep. They all stay here; they get no wake-up
     call.
     (thoughtfully)
     There's got to be some other variable, some other change.

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [O'Neill and Kynthia walk into the temple. Pieces of the statue still
   litter the floor. O'Neill notices a light flickering across the room.
   It's some kind of electronic device, hidden inside what used to be the
   base of the statue. He pulls it out and looks it over.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me. I've got a phone call to make.

   [Kynthia watches him walk away, carrying the device.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [Teal'c, Carter and Daniel come through the wormhole, wearing hazmat
   suits. An aged O'Neill greets them before they can set their equipment
   down.]

     O'NEILL

     Welcome back, kids. It's damn good to see you again.
     (They all stare at him.)
     Don't worry. Aside from a little prostate problem we won't go into,
     it's not so bad.

   [O'Neill, still carrying the device he found, motions for them to
   follow him.]

   INT--TEMPLE--DAY

   [SG-1 and Kynthia sit on the steps at the base of the Stargate,
   examining the device. The hazmat suits have vanished.]

     CARTER
     I was right. It's a transmitter.

     DANIEL
     Uh, there were two sets of glyphs that were quite tough to translate
     until Teal'c realized they weren't words.

     TEAL'C
     They were, in fact, numbers.

     CARTER
     Two different frequencies. One to put the villagers to sleep and to
     activate the nanocytes, the second one to shut it all off for the
     day.

     DANIEL
     When you broke the statue, you must have damaged the wake-up call.

     O'NEILL
     Can you recalibrate this thing to wake these people up?

     CARTER
     No, sir, it's useless. I'm going to have to use the equipment that
     we brought with us. I've loaded the frequency. I'm switching it on
     now.

   [Carter flips a switch, and the equipment lights up, emitting a beeping
   sound.]

   EXT--ARGOS--DAY

   [The villagers begin waking up with yawns. They immediately notice that
   the sun is already high in the sky and become concerned.]

     WOMAN
     The sun...

     THETYS

     (panicked)
     Alekos, the sun is already turning.

     ALEKOS
     Why did we wake so late?

   [They look around at their surroundings, worried.]

   EXT--ARGOS--DAY

   [Kynthia helps O'Neill walk through the village. Carter and Daniel are
   at his side, Teal'c walking a few paces behind.]

     TEAL'C
     Our tests indicate that your body has been cleansed of the machines
     that plagued you.

     CARTER
     I figure the immune system must attack them if they aren't
     operating.

     DANIEL

     (to Kynthia)
     From now on, you and your people should age at a normal rate.

     KYNTHIA
     What about Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Me? Oh, I'll probably move to Florida, get into a little retirement
     home of some kind.

     CARTER

     (grinning)
     You'd look pretty out of place there at your age.

     O'NEILL

     (offended)
     Why? I look like my grandfather.

     CARTER
     'Look' is the operative word here. If our hypothesis is right, the
     nanocytes in your system were only meant to imitate aging. They
     weren't meant to start the process in a full-grown adult.

     O'NEILL
     What are you saying to me?

     CARTER
     Well, without these little buggers in your system to maintain the
     changes, you should return to normal within a week or two.

     KYNTHIA

     (overjoyed)
     That is wonderful news.

   [Kynthia helps O'Neill sit, as his knees seem to give out abruptly.]

     O'NEILL
     I don't know. I was kinda looking forward to a little shuffleboard
     with the fellas.

   [Carter and Daniel both smile, watching O'Neill closely. Teal'c looks
   confused.]

     KYNTHIA

     (sadly)
     Then you are leaving?

   [O'Neill looks to his teammates, letting them know he would like a
   moment alone with Kynthia. Carter motions to the others, indicating
   that they should follow her.]

     KYNTHIA
     You will not be staying with me then?

     O'NEILL
     No, I won't.

     KYNTHIA
     What will happen to us now if Pelops returns?

     O'NEILL
     I don't think that's going to happen. But just in case, we'll send
     some folks by now and again to check up on you.

     KYNTHIA

     (hopefully)
     My heart would be glad if you were one of them.

     O'NEILL
     Sweet Kynthia, I've learned so much from you. I'll treasure every
     day of my life, because of you.

   [Smiling, O'Neill reaches up and caresses her face. Kynthia smiles
   sadly.]

     KYNTHIA
     For thousands of days?

     O'NEILL
     Sure hope so.

     KYNTHIA

     (laughing)
     That is almost forever.

     O'NEILL
     Almost.

   [As his team look on, O'Neill leans in to give Kynthia a kiss on the
   cheek. Kynthia smiles, and O'Neill laughs.]

   FADE OUT
