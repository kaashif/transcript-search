   PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1

   [Following scenes are from 7.11 "Evolution Part 1"]

   EXT--A PLANET, DAY

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac dive to avoid fire from Super Soldier.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     TEAL'C
     He was unlike any warrior we have previously encountered.

     CARTER
     We could be dealing with an entirely new kind of technology.

   INT--SGC LABORATORY

     DANIEL
     Who was the first Goa'uld to find the device?

     SELMAK
     His name was Telchak.

     DANIEL
     Telchak.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

     CARTER
     If the device was kept hidden near a water source, it could be the
     basis of the Fountain of Youth mythology.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     SELMAK
     It might be possible to engineer a weapon we can use against these
     warriors.

   EXT--RAMIUS' PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1 and other SG teams attempt to take down the Super Soldier, to no
   effect.]

     O'NEILL
     C4!

   INT--CHAMBER IN MAYAN TEMPLE

   [Daniel and Lee find the Telchak artifact but trip the water booby
   trap.]

   INT--SGC LAB

     TEAL'C

     (to Super Soldier)
     What is your planet of origin?

     JACOB
     He just gave us his home world.

   EXT--ENTRANCE TO MAYAN TEMPLE, DAY

   [Daniel, Lee, and Rogelio get captured by the rebels.]

   FADE OUT

   FADE IN TO CURRENT EPISODE

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond hangs up his red phone.]

     HAMMOND
     The State Department has received a ransom demand for Doctor Jackson
     and Doctor Lee. We've been given seventy-two hours to pay, or they
     will be killed.

     O'NEILL
     Do they know who's behind it?

     HAMMOND
     The kidnappers haven't identified themselves, but intel indicates
     we're dealing with Honduran anti-government revolutionaries. They're
     following the book on this one. Officially, they have no intention
     of paying any ransom.

     O'NEILL
     Unofficially?

     HAMMOND
     Our ties with the Honduran government are at stake. No one is
     willing to risk breaking policy over this.

     O'NEILL
     So we send a team in to extract 'em. We've done it before.

     HAMMOND
     Obviously, the rebels are betting that our tenuous relationship with
     the Nicaraguan government will prevent us from taking action. But
     they're wrong. I've called the President, and he's agreed to help.
     As we speak, he's requesting that the CIA gather whatever intel they
     can. But whether he's willing to risk an international incident...

     O'NEILL

     (smiling tenuously)
     Thank you, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I'll let you know the second I hear anything.

   [O'Neill leaves the office.]

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [Daniel is escorted out of the shack he and Lee were locked up in. He
   walks slowly, and the rebels repeatedly shove him in the back.]

     CHALO

     Apúrate gringo. Rápido. Apúrate.
     Translation: Hurry up, gringo. Faster.

   INT--REBEL COMMAND SHACK

   [Daniel is shoved into the shack and forced to sit in a high-backed
   wooden chair. In front of him is a table with fresh fruit and water.
   Rafael pours the water from a pitcher into a metal canteen cup.]

     RAPHAEL

     (slurping noisily from the cup)
     You've not had water or food for two days.
     (eating a piece of pineapple)
     Ahh. Hmm. Muy delicioso. Pick of the season. This is very good.
     Today, we're going to start slow. I'm going to ask you, again...

   [He removes a cloth, revealing the cube-shaped Telchak device.]

     RAPHAEL
     What is this?

   [Daniel takes a deep breath and stares straight ahead.]

     RAPHAEL
     And this is the part where you do not talk. Okay.

   [He takes a bite from a piece of pineapple then waves the remainder in
   front of Daniel's face.]

     RAPHAEL
     Hmm? For you...

   [He touches the pineapple to Daniel's lips then takes it away. Daniel
   looks at it and takes a deep breath.]

     RAPHAEL

     And your friend, if you tell me what this is.
     (he sighs)
     I don't know how long someone can go without food, but I believe the
     human body needs water every three or four days.

   [He takes another drink of water.]

     DANIEL

     (subdued)
     It's an ancient artifact.

     RAPHAEL
     An artifact?

     DANIEL

     Yeah. I'm an archaeologist, that's what I do, I look
     for...artifacts.
     (laughing nervously)
     And now, uh, found one. Seriously, I'm an archaeologist. You guys
     can look me up on the internet if you want.
     (looking behind him at the other men in the room)
     You have a computer?

     RAPHAEL
     It all makes perfect sense. You're nothing more than an
     archaeologist, and you find and study artifacts.

     DANIEL
     Makes perfect sense.

     RAPHAEL
     Mmm. I'm going to ask you one last time. What is this? And again,
     you're not so talkative. What gives you the right to come into our
     country and steal valuable artifacts? You call yourself a scientist?
     You're nothing but a thief. And you think you're better than me. But
     I have reasons for what I do.

     DANIEL
     I don't doubt that.

     RAPHAEL

     (getting angry)
     Chalo.

   [Chalo moves to the side of the shack and uncovers a contraption of
   copper wires and jumper cables attached to a battery. He rubs the two
   jumper cable ends together, making them spark. Daniel flinches in the
   background.]

     RAPHAEL
     And here's something else you should not doubt, compadre. You will
     tell me what I want to know.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill is seated across from Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     The CIA operative in Honduras, an Agent Burke, believes he knows
     where Doctor Jackson and Doctor Lee were taken.

     O'NEILL
     Burke?

     HAMMOND
     You know him?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I do.

     HAMMOND
     Anything I should know about? He's the only agent on this.

     O'NEILL
     We're stuck with him regardless, right?

     HAMMOND
     Right.

     O'NEILL
     Nothing you should know about.

     HAMMOND
     I see. He's requested that you participate in the extraction. The
     President has green-lit the op. There's a C-130 waiting for you at
     Peterson. It leaves for Honduras in two hours.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

   INT--CARTER'S LABORATORY

   [Carter is examining a device with an electronic probe. She looks up as
   O'Neill enters.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     I'm going after Daniel.

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     Good.

     O'NEILL
     This other mission--

     CARTER
     Shouldn't be a problem, sir. When do you leave?

     O'NEILL
     Now.

     CARTER

     (smiling slightly)
     Good luck.

     O'NEILL

     (smiling slightly)
     You, too.

   [O'Neill leaves. Carter appears thoughtful.]

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [Two rebels drag a nearly unconscious Daniel across the camp and dump
   him on the floor of the jail shack, where Lee is. They take Lee away.
   Daniel's eyes are open but he doesn't move. Lee is shoved into the
   open, toward Raphael's shack, as the rebels yell at him to move.]

     LEE
     I don't know anything! I don't know anything!

   [A rebel bars the door of the jail shack. Daniel gasps and breathes
   heavily but lies unmoving.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bra'tac, Teal'c, Jacob, Hammond, and Carter are there.]

     JACOB
     We've confirmed that Anubis has a base on Tartarus. A powerful
     sensor array prevents anyone from approaching the planet unnoticed.
     The Stargate on Tartarus is inside the structure and has a powerful
     force field protecting it.

     HAMMOND
     We need to know how Anubis created this new soldier, confirm what we
     believe his intentions are, and if possible, stop him. Any ideas?

     CARTER
     Even if we could defeat the force field, we have to assume that the
     Stargate would be heavily guarded.

     TEAL'C
     We must gain access to the planet by somehow temporarily shutting
     down the sensor array.

     CARTER
     I agree. The question is, how?

     SELMAK
     I will walk through the Stargate.

     HAMMOND
     Selmak?

     SELMAK
     Yes.

     HAMMOND
     Come again?

     SELMAK
     I wear the armour of Anubis' assassin. According to your account on
     Ramius' planet, it passed through the force field trap.

     BRA'TAC
     But at what physical cost? We have no way of knowing.

     CARTER
     The force field around that Stargate has got to be more powerful
     than the one we used.

     JACOB

     I'm sorry kid, I'm with Selmak on this one. He'll keep me alive.
     (noting the doubting looks around the table)
     Does anyone else have a better idea? Once I've deactivated the
     sensor array, a scout ship can then approach the planet. Radioactive
     isotopes taken beforehand will permit us to move around freely
     without being detected by internal sensors inside the base.

     HAMMOND
     What's your exit plan?

     BRA'TAC
     The scout ship. During the mission, I will conceal it in one of the
     planet's many low lying chasms, powering down to further avoid
     detection.

     HAMMOND
     Major, you have a go.

   [Carter nods.]

   EXT--TWENTY MILES OUTSIDE OF TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS, DAY

   [O'Neill is seated at the same table of the same cantina where Daniel
   and Lee met Rogelio. He is wearing civilian clothes (a yellow shirt)
   and sunglasses. He is drinking what appears to be tequila. A waiter
   brings a bottle of beer and sets it on the table in front of him.]

     PEDRO
     Estás bien?

     O'NEILL
     Si, bueno, gracias.

   [Burke sits down across from O'Neill. He is dressed in a tropical shirt
   and wearing sunglasses. O'Neill gives him a look and takes another sip
   of tequila.]

     BURKE

     (chewing gum)
     You don't look very happy to see me. I would have given anything to
     see your face when you heard my name.

   [Burke chuckles. O'Neill takes off his sunglasses, angry.]

     BURKE
     Hey, it's okay man, it's okay.

     O'NEILL
     It's not okay. I've got forty-eight hours to find my friend before
     he's killed. Just tell me what you know.

     BURKE
     Okay, all business, all the time. I can dig that station. This is
     the last place Daniel Jackson was seen before he hired a guide named
     Rogelio Duran to take him into the jungle. And a short time after
     that he was snatched by a, by anti-Hondurian [sic] extremists.

     O'NEILL
     And you know this, how?

     BURKE
     It's how this particular splinter group does business. Last year
     they kidnapped an important engineer working on the Cojon river dam.
     Big American contract. Insurance pays off, and they finance their
     little war against the government with the ransom.

     O'NEILL
     This engineer, did he live?

     BURKE
     Yeah, he did. Sometimes they don't.

     O'NEILL
     What about weapons?

     BURKE
     Okay this is colorful. Honduras and Nicaragua are in the middle of a
     territorial dispute. I know what you're thinking, when are they not?
     So, because of this, anyone in the 'I Hate Honduras' fan club can
     seek shelter behind the Nicaraguan borders and buy guns. What kind
     of guns? AK's, AK's for days. Nicaragua gets their stuff directly
     from Russia now, but in the eighties they inherited all the old
     stuff from Cuba. How do you like that? They let us fight Cuba from
     their shores, we got our asses kicked, and Cuba gives them the guns.
     You know we could get shot at by an AK-47 that was fired at the Bay
     of Pigs attack?

   [Burke laughs in a breathy, somewhat manic manner.]

     O'NEILL
     You been down here too long, Burke.

     BURKE
     Hey, you think so? You know why I got this crappy posting in this
     stinkhole part of the world?

     O'NEILL
     No. Oh, here's comes the blame. Are you gonna try and blame me now?

     BURKE
     Yeah, I do. You could have stood up for me. Hilary left me. What do
     you think happens in a friendly fire incident when one team member
     gets killed and the other doesn't vouch for him?

     O'NEILL

     (emphatically)
     I didn't see what happened to Woods. I told 'em what I knew. I
     wasn't gonna lie. I told 'em what I knew.

     BURKE
     I'm not talking about lyin'. I'm talking about my head. You, me,
     Woods, we were buddies, man. You knew me.

     O'NEILL

     (calmly)
     I told 'em what I knew.

     BURKE
     Well, you didn't tell them enough. And now you're here stuck in my
     part of the world. You need me. And I'm calling it on this one.

     O'NEILL
     I don't think so.

     BURKE
     I know how to get over the borders. I know where these rebels
     operate. Oh yeah, I'm in charge.

     O'NEILL
     No. You're just the guide.

     BURKE
     Just a guide? That's what you think of me now?

     O'NEILL
     That's right. You're not so gone you don't understand the need for a
     clear chain of command, are ya?

     BURKE
     You wanna know how gone I am?

   [Burke gets up an walks away. The waiter returns.]

     PEDRO

     Quieres algo más, Señor.
     Translation: Do you want anything else, sir?

     O'NEILL

     Si. Necessito un guia.
     Translation: Yes, I need a guide.

     PEDRO
     I am a guide. This? It's just my day job.

   INT--JAIL SHACK AT REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [Rebels drag Lee into the shack on his back and drop him on the mat,
   then leave. He moans a bit. Daniel goes to him, sitting beside him and
   bending over him.]

     LEE
     I never thought I would die like this.

     DANIEL

     (wiping at a wound on Lee's face with a dirty cloth)
     Ah, you're not dead yet.

     LEE
     I'm sorry, Daniel. I couldn't take it. I told them.

     DANIEL
     What? What'd you tell them?

     LEE
     Everything.

   [Daniel sighs, worried.]

   INT--REBEL COMMAND SHACK

   [Rafael is pushing on the buttons along the side of the cube in
   different combinations. Suddenly it activates, and at the center of one
   indented side of the cube appears a bright light that looks something
   like an event horizon, glowing outward into the room. Rafael smiles at
   his fellow rebels. Chalo appears afraid.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, DAY

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Jacob is dressed in a Super Soldier suit and armor. Siler tucks a
   device behind the chest plate and slaps Jacob lightly on the chest. The
   gate is activated, the usual klaxon sounding.]

     SILER
     How's that, sir?

     JACOB
     Pretty good. Reminds me of my old football days.

     SILER
     They had helmets back in those days, sir?

     JACOB
     Funny.

     HAMMOND
     Jacob, you okay in there?

     JACOB
     It's surprisingly light. I guess it's time.

     HAMMOND
     Good luck.

     JACOB
     Thank you, George.

   [They shake hands. Jacob taps his head, and Siler and another tech
   lower the helmet onto his head. Jacob moves up the ramp and through the
   even horizon.]

   EXT--TARTARUS, DAY

   [Anubis' base is perched above a firey volcanic canyon, with a bridge
   connecting the Gate platform. Dressed in the Super Soldier armor, Jacob
   arrives through the Stargate and walks easily through the protective
   force field.]

   INT--ANUBIS' BASE

   [Still dressed as a super soldier, Jacob is walking through the
   corridor when scientist Thoth sees him.]

     THOTH
     You. Come with me.

   [Jacob follows him. They enter a lab with a row of special full-body
   chairs bathed in blue light.]

     THOTH

     (gesturing to a chair)
     Sit.

   [Jacob sits as ordered. Thoth pushes a button on a device on his wrist
   and examines Jacob in the sensor-type light that results.]

     THOTH
     You seem damaged.

   [He moves away to sit behind a console and perform more tests.]

   EXT--SPACE NEAR MOON OF TARTARUS

   [The Tok'ra scout ship is hidden near the moon.]

   INT--TOK'RA SCOUT SHIP

   [Carter, Bra'tac, and Teal'c are on the bridge.]

     CARTER

     (to the others)
     Come on, Dad.

     BRA'TAC
     The array is yet to shut down. We are helpless to act. Even if we
     were to attempt secure communication...

     CARTER
     We would have to leave our position from the dark side of this moon,
     making us visible to their sensors.

   [Bra'tac nods.]

   INT--LAB IN ANUBIS' BASE

   [Thoth is still at the controls, testing what he believes is a Super
   Soldier. Anubis enters with a guard. Thoth stands and bows to him.]

     ANUBIS
     Thoth.

     THOTH
     Lord Anubis, I was not expecting you.

     ANUBIS
     Tell me how this one has fared.

     THOTH

     (nervous)
     This one has just returned, my Lord. I need time to finish my
     preliminary analysis before I can make a proper report.

     ANUBIS
     It can wait. There is a remote probe malfunctioning. It requires
     your attention.

     THOTH
     Yes, my Lord.

   [Thoth follows Anubis out, leaving Jacob alone.]

   INT--TOK'RA SCOUT SHIP

     CARTER
     So many things could've gone wrong. He's so stubborn.

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter, perhaps it is time to consider--.

   [He is interrupted by a rapid beeping sound.]

     BRA'TAC

     (smiling)
     The sensor array is powered down. No doubt, your father's
     stubbornness.

   [Teal'c immediately fires up the engines.]

   EXT--NEAR TARTARUS AND ITS MOON

   [The scout ship turns and heads for the planet.]

     CARTER

     (into comm device, the same type that Siler put into Jacob's
     breastplate)
     Dad, we're on the way.

     JACOB

     (via comm system)
     Good. When you touch down, proceed to the exhaust port assemblage. I
     think I've found a way to get you in.

     CARTER

     (into comm device)
     Copy.

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [O'Neill and Pedro are walking through the jungle, near the waterfalls
   that Daniel and Lee passed earlier. O'Neill is dressed in military
   camouflage fatigues, carrying an automatic weapon. He is looking at a
   tracking device.]

     O'NEILL
     Now, hold up. This is it.

     PEDRO
     As I told you, there's nothing here.

   [O'Neill and Pedro are very surprised to hear a voice, and O'Neill
   turns his weapon at the sound.]

     BURKE

     There is this well in the middle of nowhere. Standard U.S. military
     boot tread all around.
     (holding up a coin)
     Make a wish.

   [He drops the coin into the water-filled temple entrance. He is wearing
   full military gear including three 40 mm explosive grenade-like bullets
   on his vest. As he speaks he heads toward O'Neill.]

     BURKE

     What took you so long? How hard could it be to track their GPS
     locators?
     (holding up locators he's found, smiling)
     I'm just kiddin'. Only been here a couple minutes myself.

     O'NEILL
     Change your mind?

     BURKE

     In a manner of speaking.
     (to Pedro, handing him a roll of cash)
     Pepe, regrésate a la cantina.
     Translation: Pepe, go back to the cantina.

     PEDRO

     Cuatro mil? Muchas gracias, Señor.
     Translation: Four thousand? Thank you very much, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Momentito.

     BURKE

     (holding up the GPS locators)
     This is the end of the road, man. I mean you didn't think these guys
     were gonna make it easy on ya, did ya? I'll take you where you need
     to go.

     O'NEILL
     For old times' sake?

     BURKE
     You know, I took an emotional inventory, and I realized that I have
     some issues. Thought maybe we can put our petty differences aside on
     this one. You're gonna need me when this one goes down, buddy. Come
     on, give me a chance. I won't let you down.

   [O'Neill looks reluctant but turns to Pedro.]

     O'NEILL

     Si, Pepe. Gracias, vamos.
     Translation: Yes, Pepe. Thanks, go.

     PEDRO
     Vaya con dios.

   [Pedro leaves.]

     BURKE

     (smiling and hitting O'Neill on the arm)
     Now we're talking, sports fans! Okay my name is Burke, and I'll be
     your guide. Today we'll be looking at indigenous vegetation of
     Central America. Watch your step ladies, we're not in Minnesota.

     O'NEILL
     Easy.

   INT--REBEL COMMAND SHACK

   [Daniel is seated in the wooden ladder-back chair. His wrists are tied
   at his sides, at the back side of the chair, with plastic tie wraps. He
   appears to have been there for a while, undergoing interrogation. All
   of Rafael's rebels look on.]

     RAPHAEL

     (angry, intense)
     If you value the life of your friend, you will tell me what I want
     to know.

   [Daniel spits blood from his mouth.]

     RAPHAEL
     Your friend told me this device may be the origin of the Fountain of
     Youth myth.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it may be.

   [Chalo kisses the religious medal on a chain around his neck.]

     RAPHAEL
     How does it work?

     DANIEL

     I don't know!
     (flinching from Rafael's raised fist)
     Look, you grabbed us five minutes after we found it.

   [Raphael appears very agitated and hyperactive as he speaks.]

     RAPHAEL
     Who is this Telchak?

     DANIEL
     He's a mythological figure, a Mayan god that may or may not have
     lived here thousands of years ago.

     RAPHAEL
     So this device is many thousands of years old?

     DANIEL
     Possibly.

     RAPHAEL
     And this Mayan god brought this device to his temple. For what
     purpose?

   [Daniel refuses to answer, and Rafael punches him hard in the face.]

     DANIEL
     Ah! To hide it, to use it, I don't know!

     RAPHAEL
     Use it. On whom?

     DANIEL
     People. Mayan people.

     RAPHAEL
     And what would it do to them?

     DANIEL
     Look, the research I used to find it just gave a cryptic warning the
     device was dangerous, even harmful. That's all I know.

     RAPHAEL

     (grabbing Daniel's face in one hand)
     I do not think it is so harmful. I have never in my life felt as
     strong as I do right now.

   [Rafael uncovers the device, which is still glowing with a white
   light.]

     DANIEL

     (horrified)
     You turned it on?

     RAPHAEL
     Yes.

     DANIEL

     (pleading, intense)
     Turn it off. You don't know what you're dealing with. The effects of
     the device may be unstable. It's very dangerous. Look, it's beyond
     our comprehension! Turn it off.

     RAPHAEL
     You're lying.

     CHALO
     What if he isn't? The device is cursed. Raphael; we should turn it
     off.

     RAPHAEL
     Turn it off? Do you not feel different, as well?

     CHALO
     I do, and it scares me. Por favor, Raphael, if you will not turn it
     off, I will.

   [Rafael's face twists, then he turns, grabs a pistol, and shoots Chalo
   twice. Daniel looks scared.]</blockquote>

   EXT--TARTARUS, DAY

   INT--ANUBIS' BASE, NEAR EXHAUST PORT

   [Jacob, wearing only the cloth under-suit of the Super Soldier,
   manipulates some controls, and external doors open. Teal'c and Carter
   enter against a very strong airflow blowing out the open door. Jacob
   closes the doors.]

     CARTER
     What happened?

     JACOB
     I fooled the exhaust port into thinking it needed to purge the
     system.

     CARTER
     I mean with the sensor array.

     JACOB
     I got held up. You weren't worried about me, were you? Help me get
     this off.

   EXT--HONDURAN OR NICARAGUAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [O'Neill and Burke are hiking alone.]

     BURKE
     Rebels move around a lot. The grunts are self-taught bush fighters.
     It's harvest season; most of them tend to their farms right now.
     Those who don't are ex-military, most likely holding up about twenty
     klicks north-west of Ocotal.

   [O'Neill hears something and signals for Burke to stop. They move
   forward to find Rogelio lying on the ground, his hands tied in front of
   him.]

     BURKE
     Well, this wasn't supposed to be on the tour. At least we know we're
     on the right track.

   [They assume he's dead. O'Neill reaches out to feel his pulse, and then
   Rogelio moves his head.]

     O'NEILL

     (surprised)
     Ah!

   [O'Neill and Burke jump away but come back.]

     ROGELIO
     I've been shot.

   [O'Neill pulls on his shoulder to check the wound in his back.]

     ROGELIO
     Ah-ah! No no no no no no no.

     O'NEILL
     You have been shot.

     ROGELIO
     Si.

     BURKE
     Air rescue should be here in about an hour.

     ROGELIO
     Well, I've been lying here for days. What's another hour?

     O'NEILL
     Who did this?

   [Burke cuts the ties from his hands.]

     ROGELIO

     Malditos, malditos. Que mueran del dolor del culo.
     Translation: Damn, damn. May they die from a pain in the ass.

     O'NEILL
     All right, all right. We're looking for two scientists.

     ROGELIO
     Doctor Jackson?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     ROGELIO
     They have them. They went north. Across the border. Go.

   [Burke gives him a canteen and other supplies.]

     BURKE
     We're not just gonna leave you.

     ROGELIO
     Sure you can, Señor. Help will be here soon. Don't worry, this is
     not the first time I've been shot. Save your friends. Please. They
     owe me lots of money.

     O'NEILL
     Ah.

     BURKE
     Oh.

   [O'Neill and Burke stand up and move off. Rogelio looks at the packet
   of gum they have left him.]

     ROGELIO
     I love American gum. Good guys.

   INT--LAB IN ANUBIS' BASE

   [Thoth enters the lab and sees the Super Soldier he was testing is
   missing.]

   INT--COMMAND AREA OF ANUBIS' BASE

   [Thoth enters and goes down onto one knee.]

     ANUBIS
     Speak.

     THOTH
     Lord Anubis, one of the Kull Warriors is missing.

     ANUBIS
     What is the reason for this behavior?

     THOTH
     There was damage, but I believe our method of governing the symbiote
     mind is still flawed.

     ANUBIS
     Unacceptable. Determine the origin of the flaw, and report back to
     me.

     THOTH
     Yes, my Lord.

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

     BURKE
     He moved, I killed him. It was as simple as that. Thought he was a
     hostile.

     O'NEILL
     It's all history Burke. Now's not really the time.

     BURKE
     I know we were out of position. I wanted to cut the angle down to
     cover you as you approached the objective. I guess Woods was doing
     the same.

     O'NEILL

     (doubtful)
     So you both took it upon yourselves to improvise at the same time.

     BURKE
     That's right.

   INT--ANUBIS' BASE

   [A Super Soldier walks down a corridor. Carter and Jacob come out from
   hiding. Jacob is dressed in BDU's but is wearing the wrist weapon of a
   warrior.]

     JACOB
     That's the third one I've seen.

     CARTER
     How many do you think Anubis has?

   [Teal'c joins them from a different direction.]

     JACOB
     There's no way of telling yet. I'm just guessing, but at least a
     handful. The lab I was in was made to service several.

   [They enter a large laboratory. Some fluid moves downward into the room
   over several stairways.]

     JACOB
     Symbiote holding tanks.

     CARTER
     All empty.

     TEAL'C
     This one is not.

   [There is a large symbiote Queen in a holding tank.]

   INT--JAIL SHACK AT REBEL BASE CAMP

   [Daniel has wrapped his belt around some of the planks in the rear
   wall. He is twisting his boot in the belt to tighten it and break a
   plank loose.]

     LEE
     Shouldn't we at least wait till night time?

     DANIEL
     I don't think we have that long.

     LEE
     We won't get a hundred yards before they kill us.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, if we stay, they'll definitely kill us. I saw the short-term
     affects of that device. I know what a sarcophagus does to a person's
     sanity, and this is far more powerful. I don't think we want to
     stick around to find out what long-term exposure does.

   [A plank pops loose.]

   INT--REBEL COMMAND SHACK

   [The Telchak device is still glowing as Chalo's body rests on a bed
   near it. He begins to move. His eyes are white, like those of a Kull
   Warrior.]

   INT--SYMBIOTE LAB IN ANUBIS' BASE

     CARTER
     Judging by the number of holding tanks in this room, Anubis must be
     planning to have the Queen spawn thousands of Goa'uld. But why? A
     symbiote is spawned with the genetic memory of the maternal
     bloodline. They're egomaniacal and power hungry. That's not exactly
     a good combination for a foot soldier.

     JACOB
     That's right. But look at this. This Queen, whoever she is, must be
     in league with Anubis. She's preparing for a spawn cycle, yet her
     brainwave pattern is minimal. She has no intention of passing on her
     genetic memory. The symbiotes will be blank slates.

     TEAL'C
     Much like Egeria on Pangar.

     JACOB
     And Anubis will be free to imprint them however he sees fit. No free
     will--they're drones. They make the perfect soldier. Deadly,
     fearless, unquestioning loyalty.

     CARTER
     But this is too similar to what happened on Pangar to be a
     coincidence. How did Anubis find out about Egeria?

     TEAL'C
     Jonas Quinn. Anubis must have acquired this information when he
     scanned Jonas Quinn's mind.

     JACOB
     If Anubis had any designs on creating a drone soldier, that
     information would have been the final piece of the puzzle.

     TEAL'C
     This Queen must not be permitted to spawn again.

     JACOB
     Teal'c's right.

     CARTER
     Okay. We take what time we have remaining and try to find out what
     else Anubis is up to. Then we detonate the C4 and get outta here.

   [Teal'c places a block of C4 on the bottom of the tank. They leave the
   room.]

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [O'Neill and Burke are hiking.]

     BURKE
     Could be just a couple klicks now. How can you trust me?

   [They stop walking.]

     O'NEILL
     I don't.

     BURKE
     Think I asked you to come down here so I could shoot you, too?

     O'NEILL
     Why would I think that?

     BURKE
     Forget I said anything.

   [He starts walking again, and O'Neill follows.]

     O'NEILL
     You've had plenty of opportunity before now.

     BURKE
     What's worse is that you think I'm just incompetent.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud, Burke.

     BURKE
     So you're perfectly willing to go into a hot situation with me
     watching your back?

     O'NEILL
     I have no choice. And, I was thinking of sending you in first, me
     watching your back.

     BURKE
     You don't want to know the truth? I mean, come on, you really don't
     want to know?

   [They stop walking and face each other.]

     BURKE
     Man, it wasn't my fault. I mean, I didn't choose, I just reacted. It
     stinks, the whole damn thing stinks. You want to know what really
     happened? Fine, I'll tell you. Woods was ghosting us. He sold out;
     he was, he was no good. He was sending out a rogue transmission; he
     was giving our position away. Woods realized that I was on to him,
     and he turned his weapon on me. And I just, I just reacted.

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't you come forward with this?

     BURKE
     Come on man, you remember how close we were. The wives and the beers
     and the barbecues. I couldn't do that to Cindy. It comes out Woods
     was a traitor, she doesn't see a penny of that pension, a month away
     from his retirement. Woods wasn't gonna retire. He was setting
     himself up as a mercenary for that warlord. He made his choice. He's
     gone, that's all that matters.

   [Burke walks away, and O'Neill gives him a thoughtful look.]

   INT--JAIL SHACK AT REBEL BASE CAMP

   [Daniel pulls a plank out of the wall. He and Lee hear machine gun
   fire.]

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   [Chalo is firing on the other rebels. They take cover behind some
   crates.]

   EXT--BEHIND JAIL SHACK

   [Daniel pulls out another plank, and he and Lee squeeze out of the
   shack. They make their way around behind Chalo and watch as he fires.]

     DANIEL
     That's not good.

   [Daniel and Lee move off away from the camp.]

     RAPHAEL

     Disperen!
     Translation: Shoot!

   [Rafael and his rebels fire repeatedly at Chalo, and he finally falls.
   They move over to him, and Raphael kicks him. He appears dead again.
   They run to the jail shack to find Daniel and Lee gone.]

     RAPHAEL

     No. No! You let them escape! Vamos a matarlos!
     Translation: Let's go kill them!

   [They run off in pursuit.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OF ANUBIS' BASE

   [Carter, Bra'tac, and Teal'c are moving defensively. They hear
   footsteps and take cover as Thoth passes them.]

     CARTER
     There must be a console somewhere that will let us access a log of
     recent activity. Even if it doesn't contain Anubis' long-range
     plans, we might be able to gather intel on the movement of his
     fleet.

     JACOB

     (looking down one corridor)
     Nothing but labs, corridors, and storage in this direction.
     (pointing ahead of them)
     I think Anubis' quarters are this way.

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [Burke and O'Neill are walking slowly. Burke stops to give O'Neill some
   gum, which he takes and puts in his mouth. They hear machine gun fire
   and begin running, O'Neill in the lead.]

   [Daniel and Lee are running under pursuit, jumping over fallen trees
   and turning quickly to evade the gunfire and find a good path. Lee
   stops at a tree and grabs it to stay upright. Daniel comes back to grab
   him.]

     DANIEL
     Bill, you gotta keep moving!

   [Gunfire hits the tree they are standing beside, and they move off.
   Rafael and two rebels are firing at them from where they stand. Rafael
   yells in Spanish and they run off.]

   [O'Neill and Burke are getting closer. They stop and O'Neill signals
   for Burke to move around to the left. Burke is holding his machine gun.
   O'Neill moves off toward the sound of the gunfire.]

   [Daniel and Lee are running. Lee falls. Daniel stops to help him up,
   but Lee is holding his side.]

     LEE
     I can't, I can't breathe!

     DANIEL
     Yes you can. Come on!

     LEE
     I can't. Daniel, I can't.

     DANIEL
     Okay, okay.

   [He helps Lee to move behind a tree and crouch down to hide.]

     DANIEL
     Stay there. I'll draw them off!

   [Daniel runs off. The rebels follow, passing Lee without seeing him.
   Lee is panting against a tree.]

   [O'Neill is running alone through the jungle. He stops to listen. Once
   he hears more gunfire, he runs toward it.]

   [Daniel is shot in the back of his right thigh, making him fall into a
   tree trunk. He turns his back to it and slides to the ground. Rafael
   fires at the ground in front of Daniel and in the air above him. Daniel
   flinches in fear.]

   INT--COMMAND AREA OF ANUBIS' BASE

   [Teal'c, Carter, and Jacob arrive. They hear the sound of many boots
   marching in unison. They move to an observation window and see many
   hundreds of Kull Warriors stepping into formation on a large deck below
   them.]

     ANUBIS

     (over a speaker system)
     You are all my children. Kull Warriors. You are the instruments of
     my conquest.

     KULL WARRIORS

     (in unison)
     Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!

   [The team looks on, very concerned.]

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [Raphael throws his machine gun to the ground.]

     RAPHAEL
     Machete!

   [A rebel hands him a large machete.]

     RAPHAEL

     (to Daniel, waving the knife)
     I'm going to skin you alive!

   [Daniel turns to his left and grabs a rock with his right hand. As he's
   turned away there is machine gun fire. He turns back to see all three
   rebels down or falling forward, shot in the back. O'Neill runs up and
   crouches behind the bodies.]

     O'NEILL
     How many more are there?

   [Daniel just looks on in shock, still holding the rock. O'Neill sees
   this, runs over to him, and crouches down beside him, jabbing him in
   the arm to get his attention.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL

     That's it. You got 'em all.
     (completely shocked)
     What are you doing here?

   [O'Neill looks at him in concern. Daniel raises his eyebrows and drops
   the rock.]

   INT--COMMAND AREA OF ANUBIS' BASE

     CARTER
     There must be thousands of them.

   [Thoth enters from behind them and raises his ribbon device.]

     THOTH
     Fools!

   [Teal'c zats him. Thoth starts to use the ribbon device, and Carter
   shoots him with her machine gun. A base alarm begins to sound, with a
   Goa'uld speaker giving orders.]

     JACOB
     C4.

     CARTER

     (into comm device)
     Bra'tac, we need that ride, now.

     BRA'TAC

     (via comm device)
     I will be there momentarily.

   EXT--TARTARUS, DAY

   [A sizable chunk of Anubis' base blows outward.]

   INT--CORRIDOR IN ANUBIS' BASE

   [The team is running down the corridor. A Kull Warrior sees them and
   begins pursuit.]

   EXT--HONDURAN JUNGLE, DAY

   [O'Neill is wrapping a bandana around Daniel's injured leg as Daniel
   sits against the tree.]

     O'NEILL
     You gonna be able to walk on this?

     DANIEL

     (grimacing)
     Yeah.

   [Chalo comes out of the jungle, alive once again. He fires a shotgun at
   them, hitting the tree above them.]

     DANIEL
     Telchak's device re animates the dead tissue--

     O'NEILL

     (grabbing Daniel by the arm)
     Yeah, whatever. Come on.

   [O'Neill helps Daniel to stand and drags him around to the far side of
   the tree. O'Neill leans out from behind the tree and fires his machine
   gun at Chalo, who has just fired again. The bullets don't stop him.
   O'Neill looks concerned. Burke comes out from cover holding his machine
   gun.]

     BURKE
     Hey, get down!

   [Burke fires one round from his grenade launcher chamber,
   disintegrating Chalo into a brown cloud. As Burke heads toward them,
   O'Neill helps Daniel to stand. Daniel has his right arm over O'Neill's
   shoulder while O'Neill holds Daniel around the waist.]

     BURKE
     What's with the guy from Evil Dead?

     O'NEILL
     Um...

     BURKE
     Classified?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     BURKE

     (laughing)
     You guys are into some crazy crap, man!

   INT--ANUBIS' BASE, NEAR EXHAUST PORT

   [Jacob manipulates the controls and gets the door open. Teal'c, Jacob,
   and Carter leave. The door begins to close behind them but at the last
   moment a Super Soldier thrusts its arm through the opening. Under
   pursuit, the team runs across the bridge to the scout ship and enters
   it.]

   INT--TOK'RA SCOUT SHIP

   [Bra'tac is there waiting for them. They hear a loud thud on the hull.]

     JACOB
     What was that?

     CARTER

     Can't be good.
     (to Bra'tac)
     Just punch it!

   [The ship takes off under fire from Anubis' base weapons.]

     BRA'TAC
     Someone has opened the rear engine access hatch.

     CARTER

     (disbelieving)
     We're mid-flight!

   [A Super Soldier enters the bridge area. Carter fires a machine gun at
   it to no effect. It hits her in the face, and she falls to her left. It
   fires at Teal'c as he dives for cover. Jacob lures it away, and it
   pursues. When it gets to the ring platform, Bra'tac activates the rings
   and sends the soldier into the atmosphere.]

   EXT--ATMOSPHERE OF TARTARUS

   [The rings materialize in mid air just below the scout ship. The
   soldier rings into them then everything comes apart and is swept away.]

   INT--TOK'RA SCOUT SHIP

   slowly.]

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c. Are you hurt?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     BRA'TAC
     Where?

     TEAL'C
     My pride.

   [Bra'tac helps him stand up.]

     TEAL'C
     An old man did what I could not.

   [Bra'tac laughs. Jacob rushes to Carter, who appears unconscious. He
   takes her hand.]

     JACOB

     (tapping her face)
     Sam? Sam?

   [She wakes up.]

     JACOB
     No, don't move, just lie still. What hurts?

     CARTER
     Everything.

     JACOB
     That's a good sign.

   [Carter smiles.]

   EXT--REBEL CAMP, DAY

   the other structures.]

     BURKE
     Perimeter's clear. Just heard from air rescue; they got the guide.

     DANIEL

     (surprised)
     Rogelio?

     BURKE
     Yeah, he's gonna be okay. They'll be here soon.

   [Daniel and Lee go to the command shack. Daniel is using a stick as a
   crutch.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey. Nice back-up.

     BURKE
     Sure thing, buddy, any time, anywhere.

     O'NEILL
     You know, I think I should recommend that you be posted to a nicer
     place.

     BURKE
     A temperate zone, not too hot, not too cold. Fine looking women that
     put out like broken candy machines.

     O'NEILL
     Whatever. I'll see what I can do.

     BURKE
     Thanks, buddy.

   [They shake hands. Daniel and Lee return. Lee is holding the Telchak
   device.]

     BURKE
     Is that that thing that made that guy do that thing?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it's okay, it's off now.

     O'NEILL
     Good. That's good.

     LEE
     Yeah, at least we think it's off. It's not glowing anymore so...

     DANIEL
     Glowing thing really gives it away, so if it's not glowing anymore
     it shouldn't be on anymore.

     LEE

     (to Daniel)
     Do you want to hold it?

     DANIEL
     Nope.

   [Daniel hops twice sideways away from Lee.]

     BURKE

     That's crazy!

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   Daniel, and O'Neill are waiting at the bottom of the ramp. Daniel is on
   crutches. Carter has a sling on her right arm.]

     O'NEILL
     So... Miss me?

     CARTER
     Of course, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Well it couldn't have been that bad. You're all still alive.

     TEAL'C
     As are you and Daniel Jackson.

     CARTER
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     I'm fine. We got the device from Telchak.

     JACOB
     Good. Hopefully we can engineer a weapon from it.

     BRA'TAC
     You must. Or we will be left helpless to combat these new warriors.

     CARTER
     We have some bad news, sir. Anubis has an entire army of these Super
     Soldiers. There are thousands of them. The best we were able to do
     was delay his ability to manufacture more.

     HAMMOND
     We'll debrief fully in one hour. Welcome home.

     O'NEILL

     (getting Carter's attention)
     Hey.

   [She stops.]

     O'NEILL
     So, nice command.

     CARTER
     We did manage to make it out alive, sir.

     O'NEILL
     There's that. Lunch?
