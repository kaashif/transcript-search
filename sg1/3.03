   FADE IN

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [General George Hammond is standing before a podium at the top of the
   Gate ramp, addressing a roomful of SGC personnel.]

     HAMMOND
     You have fought with valour and courage, sacrificed for each other,
     for this country, for this planet. To honour the men and women of
     the SGC, I present Arthur Simms, the Secretary of Defense for the
     United States of America.

   [Simms takes the stand.]

     SIMMS
     Since the reinception of this program, I have eagerly awaited every
     word of every mission report stemming from this base like a
     wide-eyed child waiting for his next bedtime story. Not actually
     being here, or seeing your faces, or this Stargate here behind me,
     it is sometimes easy to forget that it's all really happening. The
     President regrets not being able to be here, but I'm glad because it
     gives me the opportunity to congratulate you on your recent effort
     in defeating a formidable enemy and rescuing SG-1 captured in the
     line of duty. You risk your lives every day in a way more dangerous
     and fantastic than any of us could have ever dreamed. Understand
     that I represent every person of this great nation when I salute
     your ongoing heroic spirit. You should be proud.

   [Hammond retakes the stand as Simms step down.]

     HAMMOND
     Before we finish today, I have one other small bit of business.
     Please come to attention.

   [The SGC personnel present stand to attention.]

     HAMMOND

     (reading from a piece of paper)
     From the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. In recognition of
     Captain Samantha Carter's outstanding work, I hereby authorise her
     immediate promotion to the rank of Major. Captain, step forward.

   [As a surprised Carter steps forward, the room breaks into applause.
   Both General Hammond and O'Neill start to pin onto her uniform the bars
   of major.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Carter)
     The United States Air Force has recognised that you have fulfilled
     tasks and duties well beyond the responsibility of Captain. It is
     with great pleasure that I bestow upon you the responsibilities, the
     respect and the rank of Major.

   [Hammond shakes Carter's hand, and they salute each other.]

     CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Well done...Major.

   [Carter and O'Neill shake hands and salute. Smiling, Carter returns to
   her place with the rest of SG1 amid more applause.]

     HAMMOND
     In closing, Major Carter's supervisor, Colonel Jack O'Neill, would
     like to say a few words.

   [O'Neill takes the stand, to more applause.]

     O'NEILL
     Normally, I'm a man of very few words...

   [He abruptly disappears in a flash of light. The assembled personnel
   look around in surprise and confusion.]

     HAMMOND
     Code 9!

   [Alarms sound as security personnel run to take up position.]

   INT--ASGARD SHIP IN ORBIT ABOVE EARTH

     O'NEILL
     And in conclusion, I'd like to say...

   [He stops as he realises he is no longer in the SGC and begins to look
   around. There is another flash of light and an Asgard appears in a
   chair opposite.]

     ASGARD
     Greetings, Jack O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Greetings. Have we met?

     ASGARD
     I am Thor.

   END OF TEASER

   INT--ASGARD SHIP

     THOR
     I apologise for taking you by surprise, but I have come on a matter
     of great importance.

     O'NEILL
     We're in orbit around Earth, right?

     THOR
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     You know, we have satellites, telescopes. They can see things like
     spaceships.

     THOR
     Our ships have never been detected in orbit around Earth before.

     O'NEILL
     Oh. All right. Sorry, you were saying something? A matter of great
     importance...?

     THOR
     We received word of what transpired with your people and the Goa'uld
     named Hathor.

     O'NEILL
     She had it coming.

     THOR
     As a result, the Goa'uld System Lords have turned their attention
     towards you.

     O'NEILL
     What, for killing Hathor? They should be thanking us. She was
     planning to overthrow them you know.

     THOR
     Her intentions are irrelevant. Earth has once again proven it can be
     a formidable threat to the Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, now we're a threat to them?

     THOR
     They have decided it is a concern to be dealt with. The System Lords
     are capable of launching an assault one hundred times more powerful
     than that which you previously withstood at the hands of Apophis.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, that could be a problem.

     THOR
     The Asgard agree. I have come to offer our assistance.

     O'NEILL
     Now see, that would be appreciated. I've seen your work...it's
     great.

     THOR
     The vast majority of the Asgard fleet is currently unavailable.

     O'NEILL
     Oh. So what do you have in mind?

     THOR
     With your permission, the Asgard will attempt to negotiate with the
     Goa'uld System Lords to include Earth in the Protected Planets
     Treaty.

     O'NEILL
     That's a good thing, right?

     THOR
     It would prevent this attack.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Um, to be honest with you, I'd rather have a fleet of your
     ships here. A few of these babies and we could just...

   [He stops as Thor gives him a curious look.]

     O'NEILL
     We could try the negotiating thing.

     THOR
     I will contact the System Lords. You may return to your planet now.

   [Thor disappears in a flash of light, but O'Neill is left behind.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me! I assume someone's going to show me the way back.

   [The light surrounds him.]

     O'NEILL
     Thank you!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Why would the Goa'uld agree to this negotiation?

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld fear the Asgard.

     DANIEL
     Plus I assume the Asgard would offer the Goa'uld something in
     return. I mean, that's generally the way negotiations work.

     HAMMOND
     Well what if the summit fails?

     O'NEILL
     Thor said that was pretty much the only option he could offer. If it
     fails...total annihilation.

     HAMMOND
     The President is wondering how confident we are in trusting the
     Asgard.

     CARTER
     The Tok'ra trust them.

     DANIEL
     They helped Jack out when he got the Ancients' language downloaded
     into his brain.

     O'NEILL
     You got to love them for that.

     HAMMOND
     But we know very little about the politics out there. How do we know
     the Asgard truly have our best interests at heart?

     O'NEILL
     Well, I suppose we don't. But if they have any other agenda in
     mind...

   [He is cut off as a bright light appears in the room and Thor
   materialises.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, do we need security?

     O'NEILL
     No, I'll vouch for him, sir. Major Samantha Carter, Doctor Daniel
     Jackson, you remember Thor? Uh, Thor, this is Teal'c and Major
     General George Hammond. He's the leader of our facility here.

     THOR
     The System Lords have agreed to negotiate.

     O'NEILL
     That's good news.

     THOR
     They will arrive in four days.

     O'NEILL

     (surprised)
     Here?

     THOR
     It is customary for such negotiations to take place on the planet in
     question. Three representatives from the System Lords will arrive by
     Stargate. You must be prepared to speak on behalf of all the
     inhabitants of Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, well maybe not me personally...

     THOR
     We have chosen you, O'Neill, to represent your planet at the
     proceedings.

     O'NEILL
     All right, now see, that could be a mistake. You see, Doctor Jackson
     here is an extremely educated and articulated man, very well versed
     in all the languages...

     THOR
     You have led your people into the galaxy through the Stargate. You
     are our choice, O'Neill. Further instructions to aid you in
     preparation will follow.

   [Thor disappears.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, there you go.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel is lecturing the people present on the three Goa'ulds they are
   expecting. An ancient Greek image of Cronus is highlighted on the
   projector screen.]

     DANIEL
     Cronus was among the earliest Greek gods, one of twelve Titans who
     eventually ascended to supreme domination. He was God of Fate and
     eventually became father to Zeus, Hera, Poseidon and Hades. Now this
     last relationship may indicate a connection to the Goa'uld Sokar.

     TEAL'C
     Cronus is the most influential of the System Lords. It was he who
     originally banished Sokar. Cronus was also a mortal enemy of
     Apophis.

     DANIEL
     Which may indicate why the System Lords didn't join in Apophis'
     attack on Earth.

     TEAL'C
     The System Lords reluctantly banded together to defend Goa'uld
     territory against outside threats such as the Asgard and the Reetou.
     However, they still battle amongst themselves for control of their
     individual domains.

   [Daniel selects another image.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, the second Goa'uld representative we're expecting is Yu.

     O'NEILL
     Me?

     DANIEL
     Yu is the name of the Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     Sorry.

     DANIEL
     Also known as Yu the Great, he did not assume the role of a god per
     se, but may have been one of China's earliest Emperors. Legend says
     he possessed great mythic powers and sprang into the world from a
     dragon's body. Ancient scrolls say he founded the first recorded
     dynasty whose advances came about under harsh rule. However, it
     should be noted that Yu did account for a number of notable,
     positive influences.

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Thank you.

   [Daniel gives him an annoyed look.]

     O'NEILL
     Sorry.

     DANIEL
     According to Thor's message, Yu is the most likely to favour this
     treaty as his interests no longer reside in this area of the galaxy.

     HAMMOND
     And the third Goa'uld, Doctor Jackson?

   [Daniel changes the picture once more.]

     DANIEL
     Another one we haven't met, but have a certain...familiarity with.
     For those in the room who don't know, Nirrti is the Goa'uld who
     wiped out all but one survivor of P8X 987, along with four members
     of the SGC, in an attempt to destroy Earth's Stargate.

     CARTER
     Cassandra's planet.

     DANIEL
     Little is known about Nirrti from Earth's perspective. In early
     Hindu reference she was a destructive goddess of darkness.

     CARTER
     So we're going to let these Goa'uld just...walk in here?

     HAMMOND

     (to Carter)
     There are a number of aspects of this situation I'm not comfortable
     with, Major.
     (To Daniel)
     Thank you Doctor Jackson.

   [The lights in the briefing room come back on.]

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, I would like you to act as liaison to the Goa'uld. Doctor
     Jackson...

     TEAL'C

     (interrupting)
     General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     Is there a problem?

     TEAL'C
     I mean no disrespect. But I have given my allegiance to you, to the
     SGC and to the people of this world, freely. I will, however, not
     see to the petty needs of these Goa'ulds.

     DANIEL

     (to Hammond)
     I'll...see to the petty needs of the Goa'uld, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Okay, Doctor Jackson. Teal'c, you will assist Major Castleman with
     base security. According to Thor, Treaty Laws will not permit
     weapons of any kind in this facility during negotiations...

     O'NEILL
     Whoa! Sir, that doesn't sound wise.

     HAMMOND
     We're largely trusting the Asgard based on your word, Colonel. This
     is their rule. As a result, the base is completely sealed off from
     the surface. The Secretary of Defense will be staying to represent
     the President. Storage Room 12A on level 17 will be converted to a
     meeting room for security reasons. You've all received folders that
     include your individual assignments, preparation instruction as laid
     out by the Asgard. There's a lot of work to do people and not much
     time.

   INT--SGC STORAGE ROOM

   [A technician unlocks a safe and removes the Goa'uld artefacts. Carter
   hands the Goa'uld ribbon device to the waiting soldier, who gestures at
   the remaining Goa'uld healing device.]

     SOLDIER
     What about that one, Major?

   [Carter removes the healing device to show him.]

     CARTER
     This is a Goa'uld healing device. Those two are the weapons.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill catches up with General Hammond.]

     O'NEILL
     General.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, how are your briefings going?

     O'NEILL
     I had no idea how exciting diplomacy could be, sir. What's this
     about?

     HAMMOND
     I'm not sure, it's Teal'c.

   [Teal'c and a sergeant are waiting in the corridor.]

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, Sergeant, what's the problem?

     SERGEANT
     He won't relinquish his weapon, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Like you, I do not believe we should remove all weapons from this
     base.

     HAMMOND
     The Asgard were explicit. If they detect weapons, there will be no
     summit.

     O'NEILL
     No summit, no treaty.

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld that you are allowing through your Stargate are among
     the most deceptive and treacherous that I have ever known.

     HAMMOND
     Thor's assured us the Goa'ulds are also forbidden from bringing
     weapons.

     O'NEILL
     If this treaty doesn't happen, they're going to send a hundred of
     those motherships here. You know as well as I do what that means.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, I'm ordering you to turn your weapon over.

   [Teal'c slowly relinquishes his staff weapon to the sergeant.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Security personnel run through the corridors to take up positions as
   the SGC I sealed off. The Stargate finishes dialling as O'Neill, Carter
   and Daniel join Hammond at the bottom of the gate ramp, ready to greet
   the Goa'uld. The Secretary of Defense watches from the Control Room.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron seven's locked. Offworld activation.

   [The Stargate opens and Cronus appears, followed by Nirrti and Yu.]

   INT--SGC

   [Daniel and Cronus enter one of the VIP rooms.]

     DANIEL
     Here we are...the VIP room. That's an acronym--it means very
     important. I hope this is okay.

     CRONUS
     Your idea of accommodation is pitiful.

     DANIEL
     Well, it's the best we...

     YU

     (outside the room)
     We will not stand for this!

   [Cronus leaves the room.]

     CRONUS
     What is this about?

   [Teal'c, Nirrti and Yu are standing in the corridor.]

     CRONUS

     (to Teal'c)
     Sholva!

     TEAL'C
     Onak holka shaka!

     CRONUS
     Treena arik croonaka shol'va!

   [Daniel moves to stand between Teal'c and Cronus.]

     DANIEL

     (to Teal'c)
     What's going on?

     NIRRTI
     Your crude surveillance devices were poorly hidden in our quarters.

     DANIEL
     Well that's because they weren't hidden. They're...

   [Yu hands him a damaged surveillance camera.]

     DANIEL
     ...security cameras and they're for your own safety.

     TEAL'C
     As I was trying to explain.

     CRONUS
     I will not be spied on upon!

     NIRRTI
     Nor will I.

     DANIEL
     Well no offence was meant by it, it's merely a security precaution.
     I'll ask if we can remove the cameras from the rooms, but we'd
     definitely like to leave them in the halls.

   [Cronus nods in assent, and Nirrti and Yu also give their permission.]

     CRONUS

     (to Teal'c)
     Do not show your face to me again, shol'va.

     TEAL'C
     Kelmar tokeem.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c and Daniel are walking down the stairs.]

     TEAL'C
     As First Prime of Apophis I often did battle with the Jaffa of
     Cronus.

     DANIEL
     Well, you must have battled lots of rival Goa'ulds. I'm sorry
     Teal'c, that looked a little more personal to me.

   [They stand looking down at the Stargate.]

     TEAL'C
     My father was once First Prime of Cronus. When I was but a child,
     Cronus commanded my father to attack a Goa'uld who was more powerful
     at the time. It was an impossible battle to win. When all was
     inevitably lost, Cronus killed my father as punishment and exiled my
     mother and I. We fled to Chulak. I vowed I would become the
     strongest Jaffa I could, so one day I could be named First Prime of
     Apophis, sworn enemy of Cronus.

   [Hammond enters the room.]

     HAMMOND
     I trust our guests are settled.

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld demanded the security cameras be removed from their
     quarters.

     HAMMOND
     I assume you told them no.

     DANIEL
     Actually, sir, I kind of told them it'd be okay. I told them we'd
     have to leave them in the halls, sort of a...compromise.

     HAMMOND
     If you think it's absolutely necessary.

     DANIEL
     Yes.

   [Hammond returns to his office.]

     DANIEL

     (to Teal'c)
     Are you going to be okay?

     TEAL'C
     I will.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Carter walks over to O'Neill who is buttoning up his uniform.]

     CARTER
     Just wanted to wish you luck, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you Captain. Major.

     CARTER
     Nervous?

     O'NEILL
     I wouldn't call it nervous...confused. I have no idea why I'm here.

     CARTER
     Well the Asgard obviously have confidence in you, sir, as do the
     rest of us. I know I couldn't do it.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     CARTER
     Well, I didn't want to say anything, because I wasn't sure until I
     saw his face, but I think Cronus is the one who sent the Ashrak to
     kill Jolinar. I just hate having them here.

     O'NEILL
     Major, I hate having them anywhere.

   [Daniel enters the room, followed by Cronus, Nirrti and Yu.]

     O'NEILL
     Oops.

     CARTER

     (to O'NEILL)
     Good luck.

   [As she leaves, the Goa'uld begin to take their seats at the table.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the Goa'uld)
     Hello, come on in. Have a seat. Thank you Doctor Jackson.
     Hello...Yu. Well, I guess we're just...

   [Thor appears in a flash of light.]

     O'NEILL
     And here he is. Gang's all here. You all know each other. Guess we
     can get started.

     THOR
     The Asgard High Council wishes you all greetings and thanks for this
     opportunity to negotiate for peace.

     YU
     The Goa'uld System Lords are prepared to hear the Asgard proposal.

     NIRRTI
     Onak arik kree.

     CRONUS
     Koracca aseemu!

   [Yu thumps his fist on the table.]

     YU
     Kornak kree! Keena arik Asgard!

     O'NEILL

     (to Thor)
     I thought we were all going to speak the same language here.

   [Cronus angrily gets to his feet.]

     CRONUS

     (to O'Neill)
     Gonach!

   [He leaves the room, followed by Nirrti and Yu.]

     O'NEILL
     What? What did I say?

     THOR
     You insulted them.

     O'NEILL
     I insulted them?

     THOR
     By speaking out of turn. This was to be expected.

     O'NEILL
     What are you talking about? They were yelling at each other before I
     said a word.

     THOR
     The System Lords have a fragile relationship with one another, as do
     we with them.

     O'NEILL
     You mean they're always like that?

   [Daniel enters the room.]

     DANIEL
     Excuse me, sorry for interrupting. What just happened?

     O'NEILL

     Apparently we said hello, insulted each other and broke for recess.
     (To Thor)
     Can I ask you something? Why did you let the Goa'uld get that much
     power in the first place? I mean, if you've got the technology...

     THOR
     We are not proud of the fact that we have been forced to ignore the
     situation as long as we have. But you must understand, there are
     other concerns for the Asgard. We have an enemy in our home galaxy
     that is far worse than the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     Worse?

     THOR
     I cannot explain further. For now, we use what limited resources we
     can spare to enforce these treaties with the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     What happens if a rogue Goa'uld like Sokar, who's been banished by
     the System Lords, decides to come after us?

     THOR
     In order to maintain the treaty, the System Lords would attempt to
     prevent it. Our greatest advantage has been the feudal nature of the
     Goa'uld. Our greatest concern has been a single Goa'uld rising to
     dominant power. If Sokar were to overtake the System Lord
     collective, the Asgard may not have sufficient power to stop him.

     O'NEILL
     So basically, you guys are...bluffing the Goa'uld. Big time. So far
     they've been so busy badgering each other, they've bought it.

     THOR
     I must return to my ship now. It will take time before the System
     Lords will be willing to reconvene. You may contact me with this.

   [He hands O'NEILL a glowing stone-like object.]

     THOR
     It will work as long as my ship is in orbit.

     O'NEILL
     How?

     THOR
     Hold it in your hand and speak.

     O'NEILL
     Thanks.

     DANIEL

     (to Thor)
     We appreciate what you're doing.

     THOR
     These negotiations will not be easy. The Asgard will be required to
     make great sacrifices, as will you.

   [He disappears in a flash of light.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     O'NEILL
     Fate of the world in my hands, and I screw it up!

     SIMMS
     I take it you apologised.

     O'NEILL
     Oh I tried. They wouldn't see me.

     HAMMOND
     What now?

     O'NEILL
     Well, Daniel typed up a formal letter, in Goa'uld, and I signed it.
     That boy can really grovel if he has to.

     SIMMS
     It's probably part of their negotiating strategy.

     O'NEILL
     I hope so, cause Thor made it pretty clear that we might have to
     give up something...big.

     CARTER
     What if it's hosts?

     O'NEILL
     Well now, that would be unacceptable, wouldn't it.

     TEAL'C
     As you have said O'Neill, the alternative could be far worse.

   [Daniel enters the room.]

     DANIEL
     They're ready.

   [O'Neill takes his seat at the table.]

     YU
     We accept the apology of the human representative and agree to hear
     the Asgard proposal.

     THOR
     In return for Earth's inclusion in the Protected Planets Treaty,
     Addendum 10815, the Asgard will allow Goa'uld access to the passage
     of Nilor.

     YU
     According to Treaty Law Section 326, no human planet will be allowed
     to advance technologically to a point where they may become a threat
     to the Goa'uld.

     THOR
     You are correct.

     NIRRTI
     Definition of such threat shall rest solely in the hands of the
     Goa'uld System Lords.

     O'NEILL
     What?!

   [The System Lords react.]

     O'NEILL

     Sorry.
     (To Thor)
     May I ask a question?

     THOR
     The human representative is recognised.

     O'NEILL

     Thank you.
     (To the System Lords)
     Are you saying you're limiting our development?

     CRONUS
     The treaty recognises that the human species exists for the purpose
     of serving the Goa'uld as hosts and slaves.

     O'NEILL

     (laughing in disbelief)
     Excuse me?

     THOR
     Do the System Lords accept the Asgard proposal?

   [Both Nirrti and Cronus give their assent.]

     YU
     The Goa'uld System Lords...accept the Asgard proposal. We demand one
     additional concession. We order the immediate and unconditional
     forfeiture of the Tau'ri Stargate. Both of them.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DANIEL
     Are we seriously going to give up gate travel?

     HAMMOND
     Considering the alternative...

     SIMMS
     I believe that ring out there is the single most important thing on
     this planet and I understand what losing the gate would mean. But it
     is on your word that we trust these Asgard and peaceful solutions to
     this crisis must be considered.

     O'NEILL
     True but...

     CARTER

     (to SIMMS)
     The point is, sir, with all due respect, it's not nearly as simple
     as you put it.

     TEAL'C

     (to Simms)
     There are other threats to this world this treaty will not protect
     you from.

     O'NEILL
     From what my buddy Thor tells me, an enemy far worse than the
     Goa'uld.

     SIMMS
     If any of you can tell me absolutely why we should not accept this
     proposal, I will forward your opinion to the President, and I assure
     you it will be given serious weight.

   INT--ASGARD SHIP

   [O'Neill is beamed up onto the Asgard ship.]

     THOR
     Have your people reached a decision?

     O'NEILL
     Um...not yet. It's kind of why I'm here. I was wondering what you
     think we should do.

     THOR
     It is your decision.

     O'NEILL
     I see. Or do I? Do you guys...do you ever say one thing and mean
     another, kind of speak between the lines, if you know what I mean?

     THOR
     I do not.

     O'NEILL
     Do not what? Speak between the lines or understand?

     THOR
     What do you, O'Neill, think your people should do?

     O'NEILL
     See, I don't know. It's a bit much for one guy to make that call for
     an entire planet. On the other hand, it's pretty obvious...give up
     the Stargate or be destroyed.

     THOR
     So it would seem.

     O'NEILL
     But you see, the Goa'uld could call your bluff, attack us anyway,
     and we'd have given up our only means of finding a way of defending
     ourselves.

     THOR
     That is true.

     O'NEILL
     Oh come on, give me something! Anything! I won't hold you to it. A
     little head nod, if there's another way around this.

     THOR
     It is your planet at stake. I believe you have it within you to make
     the right decision.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Send me back.

   [Thor bows his head.]

     O'NEILL
     Wait! Right there! Is that a head nod? A nod is usually down then
     back up, you kinda just went down...Wait, I...

   [He is cut off as the light surrounds him and beams him away.]

   INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     SIMMS

     (speaking on the phone)
     Yes, I understand.

   [He replaces the receiver.]

     SIMMS
     We accept the terms.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, you want to tell them we're ready?

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

     VOICE

     (over intercom)
     Security to Level 25. Medical team to Level 25. Emergency.

   [Daniel starts running towards the area.]

     SOLDIER

     (to Daniel)
     In here, sir.

   [Nirrti and Yu are standing in the corridor as Daniel rushes by.]

     NIRRTI
     I demand to know the meaning of these sounds...

     DANIEL
     Please just stay in your rooms for a moment.

   [He stops outside Cronus' room and sees Teal'c and Cronus lying
   unconscious on the floor. Teal'c has a head wound which has bled
   heavily.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is checking at Teal'c's condition as he lies unconscious in a
   bed.]

     FRAISER
     His vitals are stable, but he took quite a blow to the head. There's
     some intercranial swelling.

     O'NEILL
     Junior taking care of it?

     FRAISER
     Yes, his larval Goa'uld is assisting in the healing process.
     Hopefully, there isn't any permanent brain damage. But we won't know
     that until he wakes up.

     HAMMOND
     How long?

     FRAISER
     That's up to him.

     O'NEILL
     What about Cronus?

   [They head over to where Cronus is lying in a bed.]

     FRAISER
     Oh, he should only be so lucky. Severe internal injuries and his
     host is dying.

     O'NEILL
     Shouldn't his snake be taking care of him?

     FRAISER
     Based on what I've learned about Goa'uld physiology, the symbiote
     cannot heal injuries this severe on its own. We're doing everything
     we can, but I don't think he's going to make it. Could be hours,
     could be minutes.

   [Carter rushes in.]

     CARTER
     I have the security videotape. You'll want to see this.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [They watch the events leading up to the attack on Cronus and Teal'c,
   captured on the security cameras. They see Teal'c enter Cronus' room.]

     CARTER
     The SFs assigned to guard the hallway sounded the alarm. They say
     Teal'c passed them and told them he was going to see Cronus.

     DANIEL
     Well Nirrti and Yu are demanding an explanation.

     O'NEILL
     Do we tell them?

     CARTER
     Well, based on the video tape evidence it looks like Teal'c is
     involved. Not that I believe he's responsible for this.

     DANIEL
     Well, I don't believe for a minute that Teal'c would sacrifice our
     interest for a personal vendetta.

     O'NEILL
     What...personal vendetta?

     DANIEL
     Well, apparently Teal'c and Cronus have some pretty heavy history.

     HAMMOND
     Such as?

     DANIEL
     Cronus killed Teal'c's father.

     O'NEILL
     Oh for crying out loud! Why doesn't he tell us these things? Why
     didn't you tell us?

     DANIEL
     He confided in me.

     CARTER
     I still don't think Teal'c would do this.

     O'NEILL
     Well neither do I. But the case against him just got a little more
     interesting, don't you think?

     DANIEL
     Well, we have to tell the other Goa'uld something.

     FRAISER
     Yes, and if we lie we could make things worse.

     HAMMOND
     Doctor?

     FRAISER
     Sir, the point is maybe the Goa'ulds can do something for Cronus
     that I can't.

     HAMMOND
     Let's tell the Goa'uld what we know. Major, find out what really
     happened.

     CARTER
     Yes sir.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Nirrti and Yu are brought in to see Cronus, who is still unconscious.]

     NIRRTI
     You will pay for this!

     O'NEILL
     We know it looks bad.

     HAMMOND
     But we're not sure what actually transpired.

     YU
     Whoever is responsible for this atrocity must be brought before us.

     DANIEL
     We're trying to figure out exactly what happened right now.

     NIRRTI
     All the people of your planet will suffer greatly as punishment for
     this crime.

     O'NEILL
     All right, just hang on a second before you go dooming everybody...

     DANIEL
     We brought you here because we want to know if there's anything
     either of you can do for him.

     FRAISER
     He's dying.

     YU
     We can do nothing here in your primitive facilities.

     DANIEL
     Okay, can you use one these?

   [He hands Nirrti a healing device, and she passes the glowing device
   over Cronus' body. She then takes the device off and hands it back to
   Daniel.]

     NIRRTI
     His injuries are too severe. The only way to save him is with a
     sarcophagus.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, we don't have one of those.

     YU
     Then we will prepare to leave. Immediately.

   [He and Nirrti leave the room.]

   INT--ASGARD SHIP

     THOR
     You must let them take Cronus.

     O'NEILL
     They'll attack us.

     THOR
     If you hold them against their will, the rest of the System Lords
     will attack regardless.

     O'NEILL
     Look, Teal'c didn't do this.

     THOR
     I have been instructed by the Asgard High Council to leave Earth's
     orbit.

     O'NEILL
     And that's what, in line with your policy of limited benevolence?

     THOR
     I have explained our position. To borrow from a human euphemism, it
     is not a perfect galaxy.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well I'm sorry, I get a little testy when faced with the total
     annihilation of our little corner of it.

     THOR
     We sympathise with your situation.

     O'NEILL
     Right. And yet you'll still just sit by and watch them destroy us.

     THOR
     We cannot interfere without beginning a much larger war that cannot
     be won at this time.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

     YU
     We command that you release us!

     NIRRTI
     We must leave now and take Cronus before his death is on your heads.

     HAMMOND
     I'm sorry, I can't let you go.

     NIRRTI
     If we do not report back, your planet will suffer the full force of
     the System Lords' wrath.

     HAMMOND
     That's going to happen whether we let you go or not.

     YU
     You have violated every code mandated for these negotiations. The
     Asgard will not protect you!

     O'NEILL
     Actually you're wrong about something. There's one rule we haven't
     broken yet.

   [Half a dozen SGC Soldiers enter the room, armed with guns.]

   INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     SIMMS
     Do we have any idea of what sort of time frame surrounds this
     impending attack?

   [Hammond shakes his head.]

     SIMMS
     The President is readying a statement to the United Nations. From
     what you're telling me Earth should begin preparing for this
     onslaught immediately.

     O'NEILL
     Boy did this get out of hand.

   [The phone rings and Hammond answers it.]

     HAMMOND
     Hammond. Thank you.

   [He replaces the receiver.]

     HAMMOND

     (to the others)
     Teal'c is conscious.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Teal'c is lying awake in a bed. His face is bruised and bloody, and
   one side of his head is bandaged.]

     TEAL'C
     Cronus requested my presence.

     O'NEILL
     So you went alone.

     TEAL'C
     It is what he requested. When I arrived he denied making the
     request. Before I could leave we were attacked.

     CARTER
     By whom?

     TEAL'C
     An invisible force.

     O'NEILL
     Invisible force.

     DANIEL
     A Reetou?

     HAMMOND
     Could one have come through the gate with the Goa'ulds?

     CARTER
     Sir, we could break out the transphase eradication rods and do a
     sweep of the base.

     TEAL'C
     I did not sense the presence of a Reetou.

     O'NEILL
     I almost wish you had.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, are you aware of any of the Goa'uld having some sort of
     stealth technology?

     TEAL'C
     I am not.

     DANIEL
     Hathor had the ability to appear and disappear.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, she's dead. Right? Please tell me she's dead.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     TEAL'C
     I did not attack Cronus.

     DANIEL
     Well, we believe you Teal'c, but I just don't think anyone else is
     going to.

     O'NEILL
     Certainly not those lying, scheming, no good for nothing, slimy,
     over-dressed style mongers...

     CARTER
     Sir, I'd like to try something.

   [She hurries out of the room.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the others)
     I wasn't finished.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Carter is attempting to use the healing device on Cronus.]

     FRAISER
     Are you sure you know what you're doing?

     CARTER
     I've made it work before just not on a living...thing.

   [She attempts to activate the device but it doesn't work.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, I hate to go all...Freudian on you here. The part of you that
     knows how to run those things...

     CARTER
     You think I don't want to cure Cronus because he ordered Jolinar's
     death. I just have the memories of Jolinar, she doesn't control me.
     I'm well aware of the stakes here.

     O'NEILL
     I'm just saying.

   [Carter tries again and this time manages to activate the device. She
   passes it over Cronus' body.]

     CARTER
     It worked.

   [Cronus opens his eyes.]

     CRONUS
     You have healed me...human. I am sure you spared my life only to
     prevent your own destruction.

     O'NEILL
     Hey! We didn't do this to you. And we saved your snaky little butt
     because we want the treaty to happen.

     CRONUS
     That is not possible now. Nirrti and Yu have undoubtedly blamed the
     Tauri for this attack on me.

     O'NEILL
     Good catch. Look, it's obvious to everybody that one of them did
     this to you. What if I can prove which one, what's that worth to
     you?

     CRONUS
     What do you ask in return?

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

     CARTER

     (to Hammond)
     We can't prove anything, sir. All we know for sure is that Nirrti
     lied.

     O'NEILL
     Cronus doesn't know that and Nirrti doesn't know what else we know.

     DANIEL
     Which is nothing.

     O'NEILL
     Right. But she doesn't know we know nothing.

     HAMMOND
     What are you suggesting?

     O'NEILL
     I'm just saying maybe it's time we take a page out of the Asgard
     book on dealing with these...Goa'ulds.

     DANIEL
     You're going to bluff.

     HAMMOND
     Sounds risky Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Nirrti and Yu are sitting at the table, under armed guard.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Nirrti)
     You lied to us about being able to heal Cronus with that hand
     device.

     NIRRTI
     I tried honestly and failed. I was willing to save Cronus by taking
     him to a sarcophagus.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe you were, maybe you weren't. But the fact is you are the only
     Goa'uld here who has the technology to become invisible.

     NIRRTI

     (jumping to her feet)
     That is a lie!

     O'NEILL
     Who's lying? We called the Tok'ra.

     DANIEL
     They say you've been experimenting with phase shifting in order to
     battle the Reetou.

   [Yu stands.]

     YU

     (to Nirrti, angrily)
     You did not share this technology with the System Lords?

     NIRRTI
     They are lying!

     YU
     You dare attack Cronus and defile our meeting with the Asgard?

     NIRRTI
     It's not true!

     YU
     You are the one who opposed this treaty. You have long coveted
     Cronus' territory.

     NIRRTI
     Go'tak!

   [Snarling with rage, Yu grabs Nirrti who suddenly disappears. The
   guards at the door are knocked down and one of their guns taken.]

     O'NEILL
     Look out!

   [He pushes Yu to the floor as Nirrti opens fire on the room. Nirrti
   runs down the corridor to the elevator, but Carter corners her. Using
   the TER, Carter is able to see Nirrti's position.]

     CARTER
     Drop the weapon. You ever seen one of these things work? Cause
     there's nothing more I would like to do right now than demonstrate.

   [Nirrti places her gun on the floor and raises her hands in surrender.]

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Yu is fingering the sleeve of his robe, where he has been struck by a
   bullet. Carter and two guards bring in the captured Nirrti.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Yu)
     Cronus said he'd support the Treaty and we wouldn't have to give up
     our Stargate. I was kind of hoping we could count on your vote.

   [Yu nods his assent.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate activates. Cronus and Yu, Nirrti held prisoner between
   them, head up the Gate ramp. O'Neill and Daniel are standing at the
   bottom of the ramp, witnessing their departure. Before he enters the
   gate, Cronus turns back to the Gate room.]

     CRONUS
     We will not attack your world. But...if you continue to use your
     Stargate, be warned--anyone who is caught by one of the System Lords
     will be shown no mercy. They will suffer greatly.

     O'NEILL
     Well that certainly makes life more...interesting.

   [The Goa'uld System Lords disappear through the gate, watched by
   Defense Secretary Simms.]

     DANIEL
     Boy is she going to get it.

     O'NEILL
     My heart bleeds.
