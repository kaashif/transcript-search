   TEASER

   INT--GATE ROOM, SGC

   [The Stargate is dialling up. Armed SGC soldiers take position at the
   bottom of the ramp as the event horizon opens and the iris is quickly
   closed.]

   [Hammond enters the Control Room.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Receiving GDO transmission. Special code two, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The technician obeys and the iris is opened. Bra'tac and a badly
   injured Jaffa come through the Stargate.]

     BRA'TAC
     Please. Help.

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c rushes down the corridors towards the Infirmary where Dr
   Frasier is treating the injured Jaffa.]

     FRASIER
     Operating room One, now. Let's move it. Go, go, go.

   [They wheel the Jaffa away, as Teal'c greets Bra'tac.]

     TEAL'C
     Tak'ma'tay Bra'tac. Are you in need of medical assistance?

     BRA'TAC
     The blood is not mine.

     TEAL'C
     What has transpired?

     BRA'TAC
     Chulak was attacked. By Apophis.

   END OF TEASER

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

     TEAL'C
     Apophis must have transported off of SOKAR's ship before it
     exploded.

     O'NEILL
     Somebody's got to teach that guy how to die.

     BRA'TAC
     He controls the army of SOKAR, a most powerful force.

     TEAL'C
     I will return with you at once.

     BRA'TAC
     The fight is over Teal'c. The attack was swift. There was nothing
     left to do but try to save the life of young Moac, my newest
     apprentice.

     CARTER
     But attacking Chulak doesn't make sense. I mean, not all the Jaffa
     were willing to oppose the Goa'uld, were they?

     BRA'TAC
     No.

     DANIEL
     Course, it's quicker and easier to wipe them all out rather than try
     to weed out the traitors.

   [The phone rings and Hammond answers.]

     HAMMOND

     Hammond. I understand.
     (He replaces the receiver.)
     Bra'tac, you'd better get down to the OR right away.

   INT--OPERATING ROOM, SGC

   [The Jaffa, Moac, is lying on a surgical table as Frasier detaches the
   heart monitors from his chest. She looks up as Bra'tac and Teal'c
   enter.]

     FRASIER
     We've done everything we can.

   [Bra'tac touches Moac's face and the Jaffa opens his eyes.]

     MOAC
     I have failed you.

     BRA'TAC
     No. It is I who have failed you. You are the bravest Jaffa I have
     ever trained.

     MOAC
     I'm scared.

     BRA'TAC
     Kra'mel'kara.

   [Moac dies.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to Teal'c)
     His body is to be burned.

     TEAL'C
     I will see to it personally.

     BRA'TAC
     I am an old man, Teal'c. One day I wish to spread Moac's ashes on
     the grave of Apophis. But I do not know if I have the strength to
     fight anymore.

     TEAL'C
     Many have died, old friend. But their deaths must not go in vain.
     Word of this must spread to all Jaffa.

     BRA'TAC
     Yes. But maybe it is for someone younger and stronger than I to
     spread that word.

     TEAL'C
     You are the strongest Jaffa I have ever known.

     BRA'TAC
     In my 135 years I have never seen a Goa'uld turn on those that carry
     its kind this way. He massacred so many that have worshipped him for
     so long.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps he has done this to show the System Lords how truly powerful
     he has become.

     BRA'TAC
     You know well Apophis has weapons that could have been used from
     space. There had to be some other purpose. His army swept through
     Chulak as if...

   [He pauses and Teal'c finishes the thought.]

     TEAL'C
     They were searching for something.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE, SGC

     DANIEL
     The Harsesis.

     TEAL'C
     Apophis fathered a child with Sha're, the host of his mate, Ammonet.
     He hoped to create a new host for himself.

     BRA'TAC
     It is forbidden.

     DANIEL
     Yes. Because the child would contain all the knowledge of the
     Goa'uld. Ammonet hid the boy to keep him safe.

     BRA'TAC
     Of course. The boy would be hunted. He could be the undoing of all
     the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     But Apophis also doesn't know where Ammonet hid him.

     TEAL'C
     Which is why they were searching Chulak.

     BRA'TAC

     (to Daniel)
     Do you know where this child is?

     DANIEL
     All I know is that it's a place called Kheb.

   [Bra'tac glances at Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     You have heard of such a place.

     BRA'TAC
     It is an ancient legend. I did not believe it really existed.

     DANIEL
     It has to.

     BRA'TAC
     The Goa'uld fear and despise Kheb. They forbade anyone from speaking
     of it long ago. It is something my father once spoke of to me. An
     old tale about a place discovered long ago by a few Jaffa and kept
     secret from the Goa'uld. When they could no longer carry a primta,
     they would make their journey to Kheb. There their calak would learn
     the path through the darkness into the next life.

     DANIEL
     Calak. That means soul, right?

     TEAL'C
     Yes.

     BRA'TAC
     When some of the Goa'uld finally found out about Kheb, they made
     their way there. They did not return. It was forbidden to speak of
     ever again. My father enjoyed telling me this story. If the Goa'uld
     truly are all-powerful gods, he would say, how is it that they fear
     anything?

     DANIEL
     Well, sounds like the perfect place to hide someone you don't want
     the Goa'uld to find. I don't suppose you happen to know the Stargate
     address?

     BRA'TAC
     No.

     DANIEL
     Well all I have is some obscure Earth mythology that indicates
     OSIRIS once hid there from SETH.

     BRA'TAC
     That story is told among Jaffa, is that OSIRIS hid on one of the
     planets of the Lok'na core.

     DANIEL
     What's that?

     TEAL'C
     A group of planets whose resources have been depleted by mining.

     DANIEL
     I don't suppose you happen to know the addresses of any of those
     planets?

   INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

   [Carter is scrolling through Stargate addresses on the computer as
   Bra'tac observes.]

     BRA'TAC

     There.
     (He points to one set of co-ordinates)
     Those are the planets of the Lok'na core.

     DANIEL
     What's the red one?

     CARTER

     We basically have two reference maps for Stargate addresses. Yellow
     represents the cartouche that the Goa'uld left on Abydos, and the
     addresses from the Ancients' original map of the Stargate is in red.
     (To Bra'tac)
     You don't recognise this address here?

     BRA'TAC
     No.

     DANIEL
     If the legend is true, the Goa'uld never would have included Kheb on
     their cartouche.

     CARTER
     Well this address is the only planet in the system that the Goa'uld
     didn't include on their map.

     DANIEL
     We found it.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

   [SG-1, Hammond and Bra'tac are gathered round the table.]

     HAMMOND
     How do we know for sure that this is Kheb?

     BRA'TAC
     The story I have heard says Kheb is an untouched wilderness with
     great mountains and a single temple in a valley distant from the
     Stargate.

     DANIEL
     If the Goa'uld are scared of Kheb, that would explain why they never
     mined this planet.

     TEAL'C
     If Ammonet thought to hide the Harsesis on Kheb then Apophis will
     presume so.

     O'NEILL
     Well scary stories on not, Apophis is just nuts enough to go. I'd
     like some back up on this one, sir.

     HAMMOND
     SG-2 will accompany you.

     BRA'TAC
     As will I.

     DANIEL
     Let's just hope we're first.

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, KHEB (DAY)

   [SG-2 exits the Stargate behind SG-1.]

     O'NEILL

     (to SG-2's Major)
     Check in every thirty minutes.

     MAJOR
     Yes, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Hold the fort, Major.

     MAJOR
     Yes, sir.

   [SG-1 and Bra'tac head off towards the trees.]

   EXT--KHEB (DAY)

   [Bra'tac and Teal'c pause by a set of footprints.]

     O'NEILL
     Whatcha got?

     TEAL'C
     A group of Jaffa passed through here recently. Six.

     BRA'TAC
     Eight.

     O'NEILL
     So...not the first.

   EXT--WOODS, KHEB (DAY)

   [SG-1 and Bra'tac are heading along a river, passing through the
   woods.]

     TEAL'C
     You have been unusually silent, Master Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     There is not much time left before I can no longer carry a primta.

     TEAL'C
     When that time comes, I will have to decide what to do.

     BRA'TAC
     If this truly is Kheb, that time may be upon us both.

   [He pauses, then heads over to a clearing to examine the ground.]

     O'NEILL
     What is it?

     TEAL'C
     Six of the Jaffa stopped here.

     BRA'TAC
     Two went on ahead. They returned with another...a woman.

     O'NEILL
     How do you know that?

     TEAL'C

     Here.
     (He points to the ground)
     The third of the prints are small and light, the shoe an open-toed
     sandal worn by Jaffa women.

     BRA'TAC
     When they all met up again, there was a struggle and they headed
     into the forest. Each print is spread wide. They were running.

     O'NEILL
     He's good.

     TEAL'C
     Extremely.

     BRA'TAC
     The woman may be the priestess entrusted with the child.

   [They continue onwards.]

   EXT--WOODS, KHEB (DAY}

   [Daniel and Carter are walking together through the trees.]

     Daniel
     Smell that?

     CARTER
     Yeah.

   [Daniel carefully makes his way over to a bush and crouches, parting
   the leaves. A crow flies out, making Daniel jump and Carter raise her
   weapon.]

     CARTER
     Whoa!

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER

     (relieved)
     It's ok, sir. It's just a bird.

     DANIEL
     No. Look.

   [He parts the bushes to reveal the dead, decomposed body of a Jaffa.]

   EXT--WOODS, KHEB (DAY)

   [Two Jaffa bodies have been discovered. They are charred beyond
   recognition.]

     CARTER
     This is really weird. These bodies are burnt to a crisp and yet
     nothing around them has even been touched. It's almost as if
     lightning struck.

     O'NEILL
     Or maybe some kind of...

     TEAL'C
     I have never before seen a weapon that could do such a thing.

     O'NEILL
     ...weapon.

     BRA'TAC
     Over here!

   [They run towards him. He has discovered the body of a woman. Unlike
   the Jaffa, she hasn't been burned.]

     BRA'TAC
     She was shot in the back as she fled.

   [Daniel comes over.]

     DANIEL

     I count eight bodies.
     (He sees the dead woman)
     Total.

     O'NEILL
     So what happened here?

     BRA'TAC
     The priestess was being escorted back to the Stargate by two of the
     Jaffa. When they met the others, she realised she was in danger. She
     attempted to flee. They chased her and shot her. Then someone or
     something attacked them.

     CARTER
     You can't know that for sure.

     BRA'TAC
     I am quite certain.

     DANIEL
     What about the child?

     BRA'TAC
     She carried the child.

     O'NEILL
     Come on, how can you know that?

     TEAL'C
     Her hands are not bound.

   [Bra'tac rolls her body over to reveal that her wrists are not tied.]

     BRA'TAC
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     What happened to the boy?

     BRA'TAC
     That I cannot guess.

   EXT--WOODS, KHEB (DAY)

     BRA'TAC
     The priestess died more than two days ago. When his Jaffa did not
     return the Harsesis, Apophis should have sent more.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps many more.

   [They suddenly pause.]

     O'NEILL
     Kheb?

     BRA'TAC

     (in awe)
     Kheb.

   [A gap in the trees reveals a temple in the valley beyond.]

   EXT--TEMPLE (DAY}

   [SG-1 and Bra'tac enter the temple's grounds.]

     CARTER
     No welcoming party.

     O'NEILL
     Well, someone's been reading Martha Stewart.

     DANIEL
     They're probably inside.

   [He takes off his pack.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Whatcha doing?

     DANIEL
     Well something about this place says we all shouldn't rush in there
     waving guns around.

     BRA'TAC
     He is right. This is sacred ground.

   [O'Neill thinks about it, then strips off his own pack.]

     O'NEILL
     Wait here.

     BRA'TAC
     I have dreamed of finding this place twice as long as you have been
     alive. I will accompany you.

   [He hands his staff weapon to Teal'c and the three of them enter the
   temple.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [They enter the temple which is lit by candles. There is no one around.
   O'Neill glances towards Daniel and Bra'tac, and when he looks back
   there is monk standing before him.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, whoa! Where'd you come from?

     MONK
     I have been here for some time.

     O'NEILL
     No. You weren't here when we just came in.

     MONK
     Here is everywhere you are.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     DANIEL

     (to the monk)
     Um, hello, I'm, uh, Daniel Jackson. This is Jack O'Neill. And this
     Bra'tac. We're peaceful explorers from a place called Earth.

     MONK
     Do you seek oneness with DESALA?

     DANIEL
     Desala. I know that word, it sounds...tribal, African maybe.

     MONK
     DESALA is everything, everywhere.

     DANIEL
     Nature. It, uh, means nature.

     O'NEILL
     Ah.

     MONK
     Put no barriers between you and where you are.

   [They all appear confused.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     Don't look at me.

     BRA'TAC
     I believe he wishes us to take off our boots.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, look, we're been walking a ways today...

     MONK
     You're journey has only begun.

     O'NEILL
     I'm just saying I think I'm doing us all a big favour by keeping
     these babies on.

     MONK
     When the mind is enlightened, the spirit is free, the body matters
     not.

   [The monk sits down in the centre of the room as Daniel and Bra'tac
   start to take off their boots.]

     O'NEILL
     Here's an idea--why don't we just ask the man if the boy is here?

   [Daniel looks at him, then seats himself cross-legged before the monk.]

     DANIEL
     We've come looking for a boy. A baby.

     MONK
     Lightning flashes, sparks shower and one blink of your eyes you have
     misseen.

     O'NEILL
     Lightning, you say.

     MONK

     (to O'Neill)
     I only know a snowflake cannot exist in a storm of fire.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     No, I...you know me, I'm a huge fan of subtlety, but that's
     downright cryptic.

     DANIEL

     (to the monk)
     Sorry, don't worry about him.

     MONK
     The sun is warm, the wind is wild, the grass is green along the
     shores. Here no bull can hide.

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     I don't know about that.

     DANIEL
     Jack, he's speaking in the Zen Koans. Whatever theology he follows
     may be an original basis for Buddhism on Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Well that's very nice. I'll be sure to call the Dalai Lama when we
     get home. But for now, how about why we came here.

     DANIEL

     (to the monk)
     He's right, this is very important. Is there a child here?

     MONK
     There is a child in all of us.

     O'NEILL
     Oh come on.

     BRA'TAC

     (to the monk)
     He seeks a real human boy, of flesh and bones.

     MONK
     Those who seek oneness, find all that they seek.

   [Bra'tac nods his understanding while O'Neill continues to look
   bewildered.]

     DANIEL
     I think this is gonna take a while.

     O'NEILL
     Really? What gives you that idea?

   EXT--TEMPLE (DAY}

   [Carter and Teal'c are keeping watch outside. A noise distracts Carter,
   but there's nothing there. Teal'c is gazing into a pool of water and
   sees a light flash through it.]

     CARTER
     Everything ok?

     TEAL'C
     It was nothing. I do not have a good feeling about this place.

   [O'Neill exits the temple and sits on a wall.]

     TEAL'C
     What of the Harsesis child, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     I don't know. There's a monk guy in there, Daniel thinks he might
     know, so he's gonna play along for a while.

     CARTER
     Play along?

     O'NEILL
     Something about...enlightenment?

     CARTER
     Sir...

     O'NEILL
     I know. I know.

   [He takes his hat off and scratches his head, appearing bored.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Bra'tac is sitting with Daniel opposite the monk.]

     MONK

     (to Bra'tac)
     Within you is a being whose heart knows only darkness.

     BRA'TAC
     Yes.

     MONK
     You must renounce such evil to achieve oneness with Oma Desala.

     DANIEL
     OMA, what does that mean?

     MONK
     Words cannot express things, speech cannot convey the spirit, swayed
     by words, one is lost. One cannot carry darkness on the great path.

     BRA'TAC
     If I remove the symbiote within me, I would die.

     MONK
     You cannot start the journey with it inside you.

     BRA'TAC
     So a Jaffa cannot seek oneness before he is willing to die.

     MONK
     When the mind is freed, the body is no longer required. I sense you
     are not ready to meet Oma Desala.

     BRA'TAC
     I am not ready to die. But I take solace in the fact that journey is
     ahead of me.

   [They bow their heads and Bra'tac rises and leaves the temple.]

     DANIEL

     (to the monk)
     So, I don't, uh, I don't have to die, right?

     MONK
     You do not have the same evil within you.

     DANIEL
     Good.

     MONK
     But you have your own burdens of which to rid yourself.

     DANIEL
     Ok.

   EXT--TEMPLE (DAY}

   [Bra'tac exits the temple and starts to pull on his boots.]

     BRA'TAC
     I am not yet ready to give up. I feel alive Teal'c, like a young
     man...of eighty. We still have false gods to slay.

   [Teal'c smiles, pleased.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [The monk is standing before a wall that is covered in symbols.]

     MONK
     She goes into the forest without disturbing a blade of grass.

     DANIEL
     Who is she?

     MONK
     The Mother.

     DANIEL
     Desala. Nature. Mother Nature, we're, we're talking about Mother
     Nature.

     MONK
     Why do you seek this child of flesh and bones?

     DANIEL
     He is the son of my wife.

     MONK
     But not your son.

     DANIEL
     No. But my wife is dead now and I promised her I would make sure the
     boy is safe.

     MONK
     And you are sure he will be safe with you.

     DANIEL
     Yes. Absolutely.

     MONK
     Because it is so clear, it takes a longer time to realise it, if you
     immediately know the candlelight is fire, then the meal was cooked a
     long time ago.

     DANIEL
     Right. I, um, I have no idea what you're talking about.

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Daniel and the monk are sitting in the centre of the room once more,
   an unlit candle between them. They both have their eyes closed.]

     DANIEL

     (opening his eyes)
     I can't do it.

     MONK
     You say you seek this child to fulfil a promise.

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     MONK
     Is there another reason?

     DANIEL
     The child has knowledge. He can help my people defend themselves
     against an evil enemy...the Goa'uld.

     MONK
     You hate the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld are responsible for the death of my wife. Among millions
     and millions of other people. How can I not hate them?

     MONK
     Your hate will lead to the child's death.

     DANIEL
     How do you know that?

   [The monk closes his eyes.]

     MONK
     You must trust. You must believe.

     DANIEL
     Well maybe what I don't believe is that I can light a candle with my
     mind. You see, I find it a lot easier to use a lighter or matches...

   [He is cut off as the candle suddenly lights.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa.

     MONK
     Now you blow it out.

   [Daniel bends forward and blows it out.]

     MONK

     (cont'd)
     With your mind.

     DANIEL

     (laughing)
     Sorry. Could you, uh, could you light that again?

   [The monk smiles and the candle is re-lit.]

     DANIEL
     This isn't like a trick candle or anything, is it?

     MONK
     Put your hand in the flame.

     DANIEL
     What?

     MONK
     Place your hand in the flame.

   [Daniel hesitates, then holds his hand over the flame, before pulling
   back in pain.]

     DANIEL
     Ah! Why did you tell me to do that?

     MONK
     Why did you do it?

     DANIEL
     Because you told me to.

     MONK
     Because you trusted me.

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     MONK
     Within you is the capacity for trust. Trust Oma Desala. Do not
     believe you can light the candle, believe she can light the candle.

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

   [It is nearly night and SG-1 and Bra'tac are still waiting for Daniel
   outside.]

     O'NEILL

     (checking his watch)
     Time's up.

   [He gets to his feet and heads inside the temple.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Daniel and the monk are sitting in the room. Daniel gets to his feet
   when he sees O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, the markings on the wall are a language. It's a Bible. Uh, no,
     actually it's more of a instruction book on how to reach this
     ethereal plane of existence, some kind of other world. It's only
     natural the Jaffa who found this place would have interpreted it as
     passage to the afterlife.

     O'NEILL
     Whoa, slow down there, Grasshopper.

     DANIEL
     Ok, I'm pretty sure this place was built by an alien race a
     millennia ago. They may have even visited Earth and inspired the
     mythologies surrounding the concept of Mother Nature in various
     cultures.

     O'NEILL
     So this guy's an alien?

     DANIEL
     No. Um, I'm pretty sure the aliens discovered a means by which they
     could ascend to some higher plane of existence and went there...uh,
     wherever there is. But they left their writings in a shrine as a
     kind of map for others who wanted to follow them. The monk is
     someone who has taken up curatorship.

     O'NEILL
     Kind of janitor?

     DANIEL
     More of a guide.

     O'NEILL
     An usher?

     DANIEL
     It doesn't matter. Just...watch.

   [He retakes his seat near the monk and stares at the unlit candle in
   front of him. The wick suddenly catches alight.]

     O'NEILL
     Am I supposed to believe you did that?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

   [O'Neill looks at the Monk, who remains sitting with his eyes closed.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, a word?

   [Daniel gets up and goes over to him.]

     O'NEILL
     We didn't come here to learn parlour tricks.

     DANIEL
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Is the boy here or not?

     DANIEL
     I think so.

     O'NEILL
     'Cause every minute we stay here we're risking our necks.

     DANIEL
     I know that.

     O'NEILL
     So please understand I'm on the verge of ordering a complete search
     of this place with or without his co-operation.

     DANIEL
     You can't do that.

     O'NEILL
     You're confused Daniel, I can. So far, I haven't.

     DANIEL
     I am gaining his trust.

     O'NEILL
     And how long is something like that gonna take?

     DANIEL
     Jack, you don't understand.

     O'NEILL
     I think I do.

   [Daniel steps back and closes his eyes. Suddenly, O'Neill's gun floats
   up into the air.]

     O'NEILL

     (releasing it)
     Hey.

   [The gun hovers in the air between them.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the monk)
     All right, that's dangerous. Put it down.

   [The gun floats to the floor.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the monk)
     Ok, that was a little more impressive. How'd you do that?

     DANIEL
     Actually, I did that.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     That's what I've been trying to tell you, this is, it's incredible.

     O'NEILL
     He taught you how to...

     DANIEL
     ...do things with my mind. You could do it too.

     O'NEILL
     He could teach me how to light candles and move stuff around
     by...thinking?

     MONK
     I cannot teach you what you already know.

     O'NEILL
     Oh I don't think I know as much as you think I know.

     MONK
     You must come to know Oma Desala. Become her friend.

   [There is a sound from outside.]

     O'NEILL
     That your friend?

   [He picks up his gun and heads outside in time to see a Goa'uld glider
   fly overhead.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, Bra'tac, check that out.

   [They head off.]

     O'NEILL

     (into his radio)
     Major COBURN?

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING (NIGHT}

     O'NEILL'S VOICE

     (over the radio)
     This is O'Neill.

     COBURN
     Read you, sir.

     O'NEILL
     We've got some Jaffa activity here. How's your position?

     COBURN
     Clear, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Standby.

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     I want claymores from the entrance to here.

     CARTER
     I thought we were leaving.

     O'NEILL
     Me too.

   [He hurries back inside the temple as Carter moves off to lay the
   mines.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [O'Neill finds the monk and Daniel.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the monk)
     So is the kid here or not?

     DANIEL
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, that was a glider. We're outta time.

     MONK
     Time means nothing to...

     O'NEILL

     (cutting him off)
     Ah, Ah. Don't say it.

   EXT--WOODS (NIGHT}

   [Jaffa are moving through the woods. They look down upon the temple
   below.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Carter enters the temple.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Claymores are set, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Daniel thinks we should stay.

     CARTER
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     Well, watch.

     CARTER
     What?

   [Daniel raises his hands and a fire flares up from the ground. A moment
   later, it disappears.]

     CARTER

     (to Daniel)
     You did that?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     CARTER
     That's impossible.

     O'NEILL
     You'd think.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     CARTER
     You learned the power to control fire.

     DANIEL
     It's not just fire. All the instructions are here, on the walls. All
     you have to do is be willing to learn and believe.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, but something else has to be going on here.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     CARTER
     I don't know, but under different circumstances I would bring the
     right equipment and check for some kind of concealed technology
     before I assumed...

     DANIEL
     Isn't there the smallest part of you that wants to believe a person
     can reach a higher level?

     CARTER
     Yes, of course, but...

     DANIEL
     Don't you see what's happening here, I have that power.

     CARTER
     To do what?

     DANIEL
     To protect the child. I think she doesn't want me to leave until she
     knows I understand how to protect him.

     CARTER
     Who's she?

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac run inside.]

     TEAL'C
     A Goa'uld Mothership has landed. As many as two thousand troops
     approach.

     O'NEILL
     Love to stay and chat.

   [He leaves, followed by Carter.]

     DANIEL
     Wait, wait a minute, what about...?

   [He looks behind him, but the monk is no longer there. A light suddenly
   appears from above, reflected in his glasses as he looks on in
   amazement.]

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

   [The other members of SG-1, along with Bra'tac exit the temple grounds,
   only to see torchlight approaching from a dozen or more Jaffa.]

     O'NEILL
     Doh.

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Daniel watches the disembodied light materialise into the vague form
   of a woman--Oma Desala. She suddenly disappears through a wall. Daniel
   walks forward and touches the wall, only to see his hand sink into it.
   He pulls back in alarm, then bravely steps through. Inside, there is a
   room. DESALA is seated beside a crib in which there is a baby.]

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

   [The others head back to the temple.]

     BRA'TAC
     We must leave immediately and elude them through the forest.

     O'NEILL
     Where's Daniel?

   [He enters the temple, which is now seemingly empty.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel? Daniel! We got to go. For crying out loud.

   [He turns and leaves.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the others)
     I don't know where he is. He's not in there.

     CARTER
     What do we do?

     O'NEILL

     (into his radio)
     Coburn. O'Neill.

     COBURN
     Read you, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Hightail it back through the Gate. Tell Hammond we're pinned down.
     Request backup.

     COBURN
     Yes, sir.

   [O'Neill looks out over the woods and sees many more Jaffa
   approaching.]

     O'NEILL
     Lot's of backup. Damn.

   [He heads back to the others.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, here they come. Defensive positions. Hold off on the
     claymores as long as we can. I don't want to get into this unless we
     absolutely have to. And if we happen to make it out of this in one
     piece, remind me to harm Daniel severely.

   [They take positions outside the temple. Above, the moon is suddenly
   covered by dark, ominous clouds.]

   INT--TEMPLE

   [Inside the hidden room, Daniel is holding the baby.]

     DANIEL

     (to Desala)
     Thank you. He'll be safe with me.

   [Oma Desala doesn't speak, but appears concerned as he turns and starts
   to leave. Suddenly, Daniel stops and turns back to her in realisation.]

     DANIEL

     I didn't do any of it, did I? It was you. I was wrong, I don't, I
     don't have any powers at all. You do. You were showing them to me.
     That's how you communicate with us. You were trying to tell me the
     boy is better off here with you, and I...I wasn't listening.
     (He looks down at the baby, then back at DESALA)
     I made a promise.

   [He takes the baby back to its crib and lays it down.]

     DANIEL

     (to Desala)
     I promised he would be safe.

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

   [Jaffa start to enter the temple's grounds as SG-1 and Bra'tac watch
   from their concealed positions. The Monk stands before the temple doors
   to confronts the Jaffa.]

     MONK
     You are not welcome here.

     HEAD JAFFA
     In the name of the god Apophis, we've come for a young boy.

     MONK
     You will leave now.

     HEAD JAFFA
     We will not. Stand aside.

   [In the sky, there is thunder and lightning. The head Jaffa opens fire
   with his staff weapon and strikes the Monk in the chest as Daniel comes
   running out. O'Neill the others jump out from their positions, guns
   aimed at the Jaffa.]

     O'NEILL
     Drop your weapons! Do it!

     HEAD JAFFA
     Kree lo'tak.

   [Daniel raises his hands and walks forward.]

     DANIEL
     Drop your weapons.

     O'NEILL

     (to the Jaffa)
     You heard him.

     DANIEL
     I was talking to you Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Wha...what?

   [Daniel stands before the Jaffa, all of whom have their staff weapons
   aimed at him.]

     DANIEL

     (to the others)
     Do it now, all of you.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Jack, I was wrong, I was very wrong. One of those aliens I thought
     was long gone is still here.

     CARTER
     Sir, we put our guns down and we're dead.

     HEAD JAFFA
     You are out-numbered and surrounded. You will die if you do not.

     DANIEL
     Jack, if you're ever going to trust me on anything, now is the time.
     The alien is the one with all the powers and she is not someone you
     want to fool with, if you get my drift.

   [They slowly begin to lower their weapons, except O'Neill.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to O'Neill)
     We must do it.

   [O'Neill places his gun on the floor.]

     HEAD JAFFA
     Kill them.

   [The Jaffa open fire, but the blasts fail to hit their targets. A light
   swoops down and stops the bolts in mid-air to the amazement of SG-1 and
   Bra'tac.]

     DANIEL

     (to the confused Jaffa)
     Bye.

   [Lightning abruptly strikes the Jaffa, killing them all. Two Goa'uld
   gliders above are also struck by lightning and they explode.]

     O'NEILL
     Well that was cool.

   [Daniel is standing in the middle of the temple grounds, surveying the
   bodies. He turns around in time to see a glowing light arise from the
   Monk's body, to hover in the air, before disappearing. Another glowing
   light appears, this time it is Oma Desala. She is carrying the baby.]

     DANIEL

     (to Desala)
     You're leaving. You know that more will come as long as they know
     the boy is here. I'll see both of you again someday, right?

   [She reaches out and touches his face, before leaving the temple
   grounds.]

     CARTER
     I take it that was the Harsesis child she was holding.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     I thought we needed that kid. You're just gonna let her...

   [He cuts off as Daniel glances at him.]

     O'NEILL

     (cont'd)
     No choice, huh?

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING (NIGHT}

     COBURN

     (into his radio)
     Colonel O'Neill, this is Major COBURN, come in.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, go ahead Major.

     COBURN
     Reinforcements are on their way, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Take your time. We're secure.

     COBURN
     Good to hear, sir.

   [The Stargate suddenly opens up behind him and Oma Desala approaches.]

     COBURN
     Uh, sir, the Stargate just came on. There's a strange bright light
     headed this way.

     O'NEILL
     Do not engage. Repeat, get out of the way and do not engage. In
     fact, I'm ordering you all to put down your weapons until that light
     is gone. Do you read?

     COBURN
     Yes, sir.

   [Oma Desala flies overhead and disappears into the event horizon.]

   EXT--TEMPLE (NIGHT}

     COBURN

     (over the radio)
     It's gone, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     You all right?

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Let's go home.

   [They start to head out of the temple grounds.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL

     (dazedly)
     Yeah?

     O'NEILL
     Shoes.

   [Daniel, barefoot, looks down then starts searching for his boots.]

   FADE OUT

   THE END
