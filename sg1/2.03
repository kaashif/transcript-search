   EXT--ALIEN WORLD FOREST, DAY

   [SG-1 are walking through the forest. Daniel is taking video of
   everything.]

     O'NEILL

     (obviously frustrated)
     All right kids. We're due back. Unless you can tell me you've
     discovered something Earth shattering, I'm ready to bag this one.

     DANIEL
     We practically just got here. We have no idea what this planet has
     to offer.

     O'NEILL
     Trees and moss.

     DANIEL
     Well, a few miles from the Stargate, granted, but--

     O'NEILL
     Captain, any signs of radio traffic in the last twenty-four hours?
     Any chemical traces in the air to indicate civilization?

     CARTER
     None, sir.

   [Daniel raises a finger and starts to protest and O'Neill interrupts,
   raising his own finger.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah! Ah! We'll, ah...flag it for an aerial survey. As much as I love
     a good rain forest...

     TEAL'C

     (off camera, alerting them)
     O'Neill.

   [They hear muffled sounds coming from behind O'Neill. They all look. A
   man stumbles into view and falls to his knees.]

     ROSHURE
     Help me. If they find me...Taldor.

     O'NEILL
     Who?

     ROSHURE
     Taldor. They find me now.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Tal...ah? I don't...I have no idea.

     ROSHURE
     They find me. They find you.

     DANIEL
     Taldor is bad?

     ROSHURE
     All around us now.

     O'NEILL

     (humoring him)
     All right, all right, all right. We're surrounded by Taldor. Fine.
     Just relax. Come with us. Come on.

   [O'Neill helps the man up and he and Daniel walk off deeper into the
   forest. Teal'c and Carter keep watch.]

     O'NEILL
     All right...Keep an eye out for Taldor, I guess.

   [SG-1 is walking back to the Stargate. There are loud metallic sounds
   overhead and all around.]

     ROSHURE

     (frightened)
     Taldor.

     O'NEILL
     What the hell is that?

     ROSHURE
     It comes for us.

     O'NEILL

     (shouting now over the noise)
     What?

   [A beam of light encircles them all from overhead.]

   INT--THE TALDOR PLANET--THE TAL'AL (SPEAKING ROOM)

   [SG-1 and the stranger are beamed into a very large, dark room. The
   light still encompasses them. Their weapons are gone.]

     O'NEILL

     (looking at each team member)
     Everybody all right?

     FEMALE VOICE

     (off-camera)
     You are prisoners.

     O'NEILL
     And you are?

   [He tries to see who they're talking to.]

     DANIEL
     Justice! Taldor means justice.

   [O'Neill glares at him, and Daniel shrugs.]

     DANIEL
     It just came to me.

     MALE VOICE

     (off-camera)
     You trespass on ancient grounds.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, look. We didn't mean to trespass. We're explorers, we just came
     through the Stargate from Earth.

     FEMALE VOICE
     It does not matter who you are or where you are from; you helped
     Roshure.

     O'NEILL

     What? Who? This guy?
     (points to Roshure kneeling submissively on the ground)
     Yeah?

     MALE VOICE
     Then you share in his crime.

     O'NEILL
     What crime?

   [He starts to get aggravated.]

     FEMALE VOICE
     Murder.

     O'NEILL
     All right, look. We don't know anything about a murder. He was
     running from something. He stopped for help. We helped.

     MALE VOICE
     For the crimes of trespassing on the ancient grounds...

     O'NEILL

     (to his team)
     Anybody wanna to jump in here?

     FEMALE VOICE
     ...of aiding a murder...

     DANIEL
     We had no intention of interfering with your justice system.

     MALE VOICE
     ...of carrying weapon upon ancient grounds.

     CARTER
     We're trained to defend ourselves.

     FEMALE VOICE
     You will be sent through the Stargate.

   [O'Neill shrugs his shoulders agreeably.]

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

     MALE VOICE
     To the prison Hadante...

     O'NEILL
     Ah, Na no no no no no...This is just a misunderstanding.

     FEMALE VOICE
     ...for the remainder of your lives.

   [There are stunned reactions from each of the team members.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ALIEN PRISON STARGATE

   [SG-1 and Roshure are thrown through the Stargate. Roshure runs off
   into the prison.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey!

   [They rise to their feet. They are in an underground prison, what looks
   like tree roots can be seen, and humans whistling is heard. O'Neill
   tucks his hat into his coat.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, this sucks.

   [The resident prisoners enter the Gate area whistling and cautiously
   approach the new arrivals.]

     DANIEL
     Why are they whistling?

     TEAL'C

     (looking down)
     O'Neill.

   [Carter walks over and looks at what Teal'c has found: a burning pair
   of feet still in their shoes.]

     CARTER
     Oh my God.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     TEAL'C
     The wounds are cauterized.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah? So?

     CARTER
     So, whoever it was must have been standing in front of the Gate when
     it opened. Disintegrated by the vortex.

   [One of the prisoners (Scavenger) is hiding behind them beside the
   Gate.]

     DANIEL
     Why would anyone do that?

   [The Scavenger runs up and grabs the crispy shoes, stands up to look
   Carter straight in the eye and shrinks away from her.]

     CARTER

     (friendly)
     It's okay.

   [He backs off and Carter follows.]

     CARTER
     We're not going to hurt you. Please, We just want to talk to you.
     It's all right. We just want to talk to you.

     TEAL'C

     (warningly)
     Captain Carter!

   [Carter is suddenly grabbed from behind by a very large, ugly man. She
   struggles. Hitting him with a backwards head-butt, she attempts to kick
   him in the shins. All the other prisoners just stand around and watch.]

     LINEA
     Vishnor.

   [Vishnor drops Carter quickly, while she turns around to defend
   herself. Vishnor wipes some blood from his busted lip as the crowd of
   prisoners break open to reveal an older lady approaching SG-1, Linea.]

     LINEA
     You have been sent through the great circle

     DANIEL
     Well, yes but that was...

     LINEA
     You have been sentenced to life imprisonment for your crimes, or you
     would not be here. I am Linea.

     DANIEL
     Well, I am Daniel. This is Jack, Captain Carter and Teal'c. If
     you're the one that stopped this attack, ah, then I suppose we are
     grateful.

   [Linea turns and puts a possessive hand on Carter's shoulder.]

     LINEA

     (to the other prisoners)
     This woman is under my protection. She is not to be taken by any
     man.

     CARTER
     It's all right.

   [Linea raises a hand to stop Carter from speaking, directing her
   attention to Vishnor.]

     LINEA

     Is that clear Vishnor?
     (repeating after he doesn't answer)
     Is that clear?

   [Vishnor backs off and the others walk away.]

     LINEA

     (to Carter)
     You were saying?

     CARTER
     Ah... ah, that I can take care of myself.

     LINEA
     I mean you no disrespect. But I know what it is to be a woman in
     Hadante.

     CARTER

     (nods and mouths)
     Thank you.

     LINEA

     (turns back to the men of SG-1)
     For what little it is worth, welcome.

   [Linea turns and leaves.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, ah, excuse me but...

     O'NEILL

     Daniel, I think that's about it for the welcome wagon.
     (to Carter)
     You all right?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, kids. This is our situation. What do we need?

     DANIEL
     Well. A dial-home-device would be nice.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, let's assume we don't find one of those. What else?

     CARTER
     Power to free up the super conductive ring on the Stargate.

     TEAL'C
     So that we may dial the Gate manually.

     CARTER
     It's worked before.

     O'NEILL
     Right. So we're looking for a power source. Teal'c, look scary and
     take point.

   [They start to walk away from the immediate Gate area. Teal'c leads,
   but the rest get separated momentarily by two prisoners blocking their
   way.]

     O'NEILL

     (to the other prisoners and pointing to Teal'c)
     We're with him.

   [They squeeze past the menacing prisoners. They walk until they find an
   alcove.]

     DANIEL
     It's like we're in Botany Bay.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     Oh, the original name for Sydney Harbor. When the British first
     colonized Australia, they turned it into a continental prison that
     was half a world away.

   [Realization of how far away they are from home hits Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Of course this is probably more than...that.

   [O'Neill comfortingly pats Daniel's shoulder.]

     O'NEILL
     It's okay, Daniel. It's okay.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps the Taldor believe the Stargate only goes here.

     CARTER
     Wherever here is.

   [They continue to walk down a few corridors deeper into the prison and
   they come across the prisoner who'd grabbed the dead prisoner's shoes
   from the Stargate area. The scavenger is dragging a dead prisoner.]

     SCAVENGER

     (to Carter)
     Here. I give.

     DANIEL
     You killed him?

     SCAVENGER
     No, no, no, no, not me. Killed himself. Not me.

     O'NEILL

     (not believing him)
     Right.

   [The Scavenger rips a necklace off the dead prisoner.]

     SCAVENGER
     Here. For you.

     CARTER
     In exchange for?

     SCAVENGER
     Like Linea, a gift. For the protected one.

   [Carter refuses with a gesture. He turns to Teal'c.]

     SCAVENGER
     You are very strong. Yes?

     TEAL'C
     I am.

     SCAVENGER
     Maybe you challenge Vishnor? Maybe you win. Maybe...I be your
     friend.

     TEAL'C
     Maybe not.

   [The prisoner looks disappointed then continues on his way with the
   dead body.]

     O'NEILL

     (watching the man drag the body away)
     Okay...
     (to Daniel)
     Daniel, you and Teal'c keep looking around Botany Bay here. Carter
     and I are going to have a little chat with...
     (looks to Carter)

     CARTER
     Linea.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Something's generating the power around here, and she seems
     to be in charge. okay?

   [O'Neill looks around again as Daniel nods numbly. He and Teal'c start
   to walk away, and O'Neill catches Daniel's arm.]

     O'NEILL

     Oh, Daniel.
     (he motions Daniel to come closer)
     You gotta trust me on this.

   [O'Neill reaches up and removes Daniel's glasses, placing them in
   Daniel's jacket breast pocket.]

     O'NEILL
     Signs of weakness are not a good thing in prison.

   [O'Neill pats Daniel on the arm, and Daniel and Teal'c leave. O'Neill
   and Carter proceed through the corridor to find Linea.]

     CARTER
     You know, sir, without our remote transmitters--

     O'NEILL
     Captain. General Hammond will send another SG team as soon as we're
     overdue.

     ROSHURE

     (runs up and gets in O'Neill's face)
     Help. Help me, please! They're after me! Please!

   [He grabs O'Neill by the jacket lapels. O'Neill pulls Roshure's hands
   off.]

     O'NEILL
     Get off! Get outta here!

   [He throws him to the ground. Roshure then gets up and runs off. A few
   of the other prisoners run between Carter and O'Neill, chasing
   Roshure.]

     CARTER
     What do you think they're going to do to him?

     O'NEILL
     Not our problem, Captain.

   [O'Neill turns and walks away. Carter follows him.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [A technician sits at her monitor.]

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     We're getting SG-3's remote transmitter signal, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Let's hope they found SG-1. Open the iris.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [As Hammond looks on, the iris opens. SG-3 come through in camouflage.
   Major Warren leads his men down the ramp, looks directly at Hammond
   through the window and solemnly shakes his head.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND

     (disappointed)
     Have them report directly to the briefing room.

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     Yes, sir.

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, LINEA'S QUARTERS

   [Linea is putting the stopper in bottle of a strange luminescent
   liquid. Her quarters are very much like a lab with shelves holding
   bottles of liquids and other makeshift lab equipment. O'Neill and
   Carter stand in the doorway and Linea seems to sense their presence.]

     LINEA

     Sooner or later, all new arrivals come here.
     (she turns to face them)
     You're not from any of the island states under the Taldor.

     O'NEILL
     Uh...no. We're from Earth. Earth is...well, it's way out there.

     LINEA
     Then you are from a place of which I have no knowledge. Do you
     intend to challenge me?

     O'NEILL
     Well, all we really want to do right now is get out of here.

     LINEA

     (smirks)
     Get out of here? We are deep underground.
     (she puts the bottle on a shelf)
     It is my understanding that the great circle transported us to an
     entirely different world. One that once teemed with life, but no
     more. This place, thousands of years old, is all that remains.
     That's why the Taldor turned it into a prison. They could see no
     other use.

     CARTER
     So, bottom line: the Stargate is the only way in or out.

     LINEA
     Many here believe that when a prisoner comes through
     the..."Stargate", they can be caught in the circle's great wave and
     returned to the other side.

   [Carter and O'Neill look at each other.]

     O'NEILL

     (clears his throat)
     Actually...they die.

   [Linea tilts her head trying to understand.]

     CARTER
     You see, what--what you just referred to as "The Great Wave" is
     actually an unstable vortex generated when the Gate first opens.
     Anything inside its radius is completely disintegrated.

     O'NEILL
     There was a pair of smoking feet standing in place when we got here.

     LINEA

     (sitting down)
     There are two ways and two ways only to control a society: through
     fear or through hope. In this world, fear is a constant. The belief
     in escape, whether founded or not, allows hope.

     O'NEILL

     So... out of hope...
     (O'Neill and Carter sit down)
     ...these people are killing themselves?

     LINEA
     If they believe it is escape, who am I to say it is not?

     O'NEILL
     Well, we have a better way.

     LINEA
     What would you ask of me?

     CARTER
     We need power.

     LINEA
     There are many forms of power, my dear. Some more subtle than
     others.

     O'NEILL
     For the moment, we just need the electrical kind.

     LINEA
     Then we both have something the other wants.

   [Carter looks at O'Neill who maintains eye contact with Linea.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Weapons and packs lie upon on the conference table. General Hammond
   picks one up.]

     HAMMOND
     They just handed you SG-1's weapons and remote transmitters? Offered
     no further explanation?

     WARREN
     Only that they had been accused of a crime and sent through the
     Stargate to some sort of prison.

     HAMMOND
     What crime?

     WARREN
     They said it wasn't my concern and sent me straight to the Stargate.
     I was going to take my men back--

     HAMMOND
     No, you did the right thing returning to base. From what you tell
     me, this has become a diplomatic problem. That means SG-9.

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, LINEA'S QUARTERS

   [Carter and O'Neill are still seated facing Linea.]

     LINEA
     I've long believed that the best way to get knowledge is to give it.

   [She pulls a couple of small bottles from a shelf and returns to the
   table. There is a plant like object on it.]

     LINEA
     These are my activators.

   [She slowly puts a couple of drops onto the plant, and it starts to
   turn green and glow from within.]

     CARTER

     (intrigued)
     Is this a chemical reaction?

     LINEA
     Much more.

   [O'Neill looks under the table.]

     LINEA
     The liquid permeates the hard core of the terra-root and allows for
     the organic material within to interact on a basic level.

     O'NEILL
     Basic? Meaning?

     LINEA
     That which we cannot see, but of which all is made.

   [O'Neill turns slightly to Carter, questioning.]

     CARTER
     Subatomic.

     O'NEILL
     Ah.

     CARTER

     (to Linea)
     Are we talking about organically based cold fusion?

     LINEA
     I do not know your terminology.

     CARTER
     Uh, what you call basics, we call atoms. Groups of protons,
     neutrons, and electrons. These are the basic building blocks of all
     matter.

     LINEA
     My activators spirit these materials to combine within the cells of
     the terra-root. When new material is made, new energy is released,
     flowing through the tendrils of the plant.

     CARTER
     Colonel, that's cold fusion.

     O'NEILL
     Mmm?

     CARTER
     Whatever organic mineral the roots are made of serves as a catalyst,
     causing the atoms of her chemicals to fuse together. If we had this
     on Earth...

   [O'Neill pinches the bridge of his nose.]

     CARTER
     ...we'd practically eliminate pollution--

     O'NEILL
     Captain. Back to basics. Will it power the Stargate?

     CARTER

     (looks at Linea)
     It might.

     LINEA
     Activate the great circle from this side? The permutations number in
     the billions. It's incalculable.

     O'NEILL

     Well, actually,
     (indicating Carter with a nod of his head)
     she figured it out.

     LINEA
     You?

     CARTER
     Oh, it was a team effort, really--

     LINEA
     How?

     CARTER
     Ah, well--

     O'NEILL

     (standing)
     Tell you what, provide the power we need, and we'll take you with
     us.

     LINEA
     Only then will you share the knowledge?

     O'NEILL
     That's the deal.

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, A PASSAGEWAY

   [Teal'c has a prisoner braced up against the wall by the neck with his
   left hand and is choking him. Daniel worriedly looks on.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c, I--I think he's had enough.

     TEAL'C
     If you once again try to physically harm myself or any of my
     companions, my patience with you will expire.

   [Teal'c drops the prisoner, and the prisoner stumbles away clutching
   his throat. Carter and O'Neill walk up.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, Teal'c...Making friends, are you?

     TEAL'C
     We found nothing of use.

     DANIEL

     Although I am fairly certain that this structure is the ruins of
     some sort of alien Gate terminal. Probably over 15,000 years old.
     That almost certainly pre-dates human civilization.
     (O'Neill looks dully at Daniel)
     Which is not of any use, per se.

     O'NEILL
     We may have found what we need.

     CARTER
     Linea has a power source. And not just any power source either; this
     is incredible.

     DANIEL
     And she's just going to hand it over?

   [Carter looks at O'Neill, who shrugs.]

     O'NEILL
     If we take her back with us.

     DANIEL
     Well can we just do that? I mean, we don't even know what she's in
     here for.

     CARTER
     What are we in here for?

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Jaywalking, I think?

     TEAL'C
     Clearly, Linea has done something to earn the respect of these
     prisoners.

     DANIEL
     Well, when she warned that man to stay away from Sam, I saw fear in
     his eyes. Not respect.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically, to Daniel)
     I'm just going to assume you've never been in prison before.

     DANIEL
     Oh, right. And--and you have?

   [O'Neill stares at Daniel.]

     O'NEILL

     (pointedly at Daniel)
     Oh, yeah. Any place like this has its own set of rules, and they
     don't have to make sense. Linea's obviously done whatever she's
     needed to do to survive. Just like we are.
     (O'Neill touches Carter on the arm)
     Speaking of which?

     CARTER
     Well, Colonel, we're talking about powering one completely alien
     device with another. I mean, it's not like splicing together a few
     wires.

     O'NEILL
     I'll take that as a maybe?

     TEAL'C
     Without remote transmitters, we still have no access to Earth. The
     iris will be closed.

     O'NEILL

     Okay.
     (sighs)
     Daniel, you know more addresses than any of us, start thinking of
     alternatives.

   [The Stargate powers up, drawing their attention.]

     CARTER
     Incoming.

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, GATE ROOM

   [Chevrons lock in place as prisoners gather in the room. Some shuffle
   toward the Gate dragging a large chute and vat. All of them carry
   bowls. The team watch as the prisoners pass by. Vishnor walks up to
   O'Neill and points at him menacingly.]

     VISHNOR
     You eat last.

   [O'Neill waves off what is clearly a whiff of bad breath as Vishnor
   walks away. The Gate kawooshes open, and the prisoners move to position
   the chute and vat on the steps of the Gate. SG-1 stand away from the
   group and watch, then a thick grey substance pours through the Gate,
   down the chute and into the vat. The prisoners clamor around it,
   grunting in anticipation, but Vishnor pulls a few of them out of the
   way and stands guard as he and the assembled turn to where Linea is
   standing. The Gate shuts down and Linea walks to the vat with her bowl,
   the prisoners making a path for her. She hands her bowl to Vishnor who
   bows to her, then scoops some of the gruel out, handing the bowl back
   to her.]

     LINEA
     Thank you, Vishnor.

   [Vishnor is handed his bowl by another prisoner and scoops some out for
   himself, and as he turns away, the others push in to get their
   portions. After scooping, each runs back into the depths of the prison.
   The Scavenger is at the vat scooping out the gruel with his fingers,
   eating it. He then motions SG-1 over to partake. He offers his bowl of
   slop to O'Neill. O'Neill takes it, takes a sniff and grimaces. Dipping
   two fingers into the slop he passes it to Carter, and Carter is already
   grimacing from the smell. She dips and passes it to Teal'c, sniffing
   the concoction with revulsion.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Major Kovacek addresses General Hammond. Major Warren stands next to
   the General.]

     KOVACEK
     Sir, SG-1 broke the law on P3X-775. We don't have to agree with
     their law, but we may have to respect it.

     HAMMOND
     Sounds to me like they just made an honest mistake.

     KOVACEK
     We tried to explain that, sir. On our world, unknowingly abetting a
     criminal doesn't merit this kind of punishment. However the Taldor,
     they're the judicial body, they believe in zero tolerance almost
     religiously. No appeals process, essentially, a single sentence:
     life imprisonment for nearly all offenses.

     HAMMOND
     That doesn't sound like justice to me.

     KOVACEK
     Perhaps not, sir, but the fact is they have virtually no crime. Just
     crimes of passion, sometimes the occasional sociopath.

     WARREN
     General, sir, SG-3 is prepared and willing to go in.

     KOVACEK
     No sir, with all due respect, force isn't the answer, sir. They're
     far more technologically advanced than we are. We couldn't possibly
     succeed in extracting SG-1, and we'd just be making an enemy.

     WARREN
     They've already made an enemy.

     KOVACEK
     No. I disagree. Sir, they are open to relations with us. In fact
     next time, I think several members of the Taldor are going to allow
     us see their faces.

     WARREN
     Sir, This is nuts. Let my team go back.

     HAMMOND

     (to Major Warren)
     Major, as of 0800 tomorrow, your unit is scheduled for standard
     recon of P2A-509. I expect you to be ready to carry out your
     mission.

     WARREN

     (reluctantly)
     Yes, sir.

   [Warren leaves the briefing room.]

     HAMMOND

     Major Kovacek, return to P3X-775. Let them know we mean business.
     (Pauses, reconsidering)
     Better yet, I'll tell them myself.

   [Kovacek looks at the general, then turns and leaves. Hammond walks
   over to look down at the Stargate.]

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, LINEA'S QUARTERS

   [A blue, luminous waterfall cascades down part of a rocky wall. Linea
   is seated by it adding some drops from a nondescript bottle of liquid
   into her bowl of gruel. Carter walks in.]

     LINEA
     I treat it before ingesting. It is quite better than what you
     scraped from the bottom of the barrel.

   [Carter sits next to Linea on the rocky out-cropping, and Linea hands
   Carter her bowl of food.]

     CARTER

     (surprised)
     Uh, thank you. Actually, I came to ask you something.

     LINEA
     My crime.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     LINEA
     There was an experiment with tragic consequences. People died.

     CARTER
     How many people?

     LINEA
     Thousands. It began with a terrible plague among the people who sent
     you here. Time was short; I offered my knowledge. Instead of
     inhibiting the disease's progress, my medicine accelerated its
     effects.

     CARTER
     And they blamed you.

     LINEA
     Yes.

     CARTER
     I'm not surprised. We didn't deserve this either.

     LINEA
     Do not think that I am innocent.

     CARTER
     What you're saying is that you take responsibility for your actions?

     LINEA
     Yes.

   [Linea stands and walks over to her terra-root.]

     LINEA
     I have decided to accept your offer.

     CARTER

     (standing also)
     Great. I'll tell the colonel.

     LINEA
     You have altered the balance of power here. I have no choice.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, I don't understand.

     LINEA
     It's only a matter of time before Vishnor and his followers
     challenge your friends.

     CARTER
     I'll warn them. Thank you.

     LINEA
     Tell them also, that if they fail, they will not live to try again.

     CARTER

     (startled)
     Okay.

   [Carter leaves Linea.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Hammond and Kovacek are kitted out in fatigues and walking hurriedly.]

     KOVACEK
     We better hurry, sir. The Taldor believe punctuality is emblematic
     as civilized behavior.

     HAMMOND
     They do, do they?

     KOVACEK
     We'll be transported almost immediately upon our arrival to their
     Tal'al, or speaking area. Once there, the Taldor may or may not be
     willing to show you their actual face.

     HAMMOND
     Why's that?

     KOVACEK
     To put it politely, sir, they're xenophobic. To put it frankly,
     they're arrogant, narrow-minded, self-centered--

     HAMMOND
     I get the picture.

   [They enter the Gate room; the Stargate is already active.]

     KOVACEK
     But they do seem to want to maintain diplomatic contact.

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN VOICE
     Special envoy, you may embark when ready.

   [The Major and General walk up the ramp. Seen through the watery
   surface, Hammond pauses for a moment before the event horizon.]

     HAMMOND

     (taking a deep breath)
     Well, here goes.

     KOVACEK
     Since this is your first time, sir, a quick word of advice: it's
     better to exhale just prior to crossing the event horizon. One's
     instinct is to inhale immediately upon arriving on the other side.
     Also--

     HAMMOND

     I think I'll figure it out on the way.
     (leans in slightly to Kovacek)
     You're sure they dialed the correct address?

     KOVACEK
     Yes sir.

     HAMMOND

     (purses his lips)
     The things I do for these people.

   [The General and Kovacek step through.]

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE

   [Daniel is sitting on the ground and scratches out two lines in the
   dirt. O'Neill is sitting on some stairs looking down at the list
   written in the dirt.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, so Cimmeria's out. So is Chulak.

   [Carter walks in and joins them.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain?

     CARTER
     She says she'll give us power as long as we take her with us.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's fine, but we still need a destination.

   [Carter kneels down next to Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, well, P3A-707 might work, but there's no telling how long we'd
     be there before--

   [The Stargate powers up, drawing their attention.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud. Let's go.

   [Carter gets up and dodges behind a larger root, and O'Neill follows,
   pulling Daniel to his feet. They move a short distance to look at the
   Gate as the chevrons lock into place. A few prisoners run past them
   toward the Gate. One is Roshure.]

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

     CARTER
     They think it's a way to escape.

     DANIEL

     (shocked)
     What?

   [Daniel rushes up to Roshure.]

     DANIEL
     Excuse me. Listen to me.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel!

   [Daniel stands between the three prisoners and the Gate, right in the
   path of the vortex. The chevrons continue to lock.]

     DANIEL
     Look, this won't save you.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, get out of there!!

     DANIEL

     (to the prisoners)
     You won't escape. You'll die.

     ROSHURE

     (grabbing Daniel by the shoulders)
     Out of my way!

   [He throws Daniel aside and he falls at Vishnor's feet just before the
   vortex explodes and engulfs the three prisoners. Daniel, Carter and
   O'Neill's react to the deaths of the three and then a new prisoner is
   thrown in from the Gate, falling and rolling down the steps to the
   ground. They all look at the new prisoner as he rises and the Stargate
   shuts down. The new prisoner is obviously blind. The whistling
   commences as other prisons assemble at the Gate, and Vishnor sneers at
   Daniel.]

     VISHNOR

     (menacingly)
     How dare you interfere.

   [O'Neill and Carter move in closer, seeing Daniel threatened.]

     DANIEL
     I was trying to save those men's lives. They're dead now. They
     haven't escaped anywhere. They are dead.

     LINEA
     Vishnor.

   [The assembled prisoners turn to see Linea, who walks up to them.]

     LINEA
     Leave him.

     VISHNOR

     (to Linea)
     He challenges me. I accept.

   [Daniel steps towards Linea.]

     DANIEL
     How can you let this happen? Roshure just threw his life away.

     LINEA
     It was his life. The rules are the rules. Even I must obey them.

   [Linea walks away. Vishnor grabs Daniel into a vicious bear hug from
   behind, while one of the other prisoners comes up behind O'Neill and
   wraps a cord around his neck. Another brandishes a sharp implement in
   front of Carter, but he goes after O'Neill, who is in the grasp of the
   other prisoner. Everyone is avoiding Carter. Carter rushes over to
   Linea.]

     CARTER
     Linea, you can stop this.

     LINEA

     (dispassionately)
     I told you this was going to happen.

     CARTER

     (yelling over the crowd)
     Teal'c! Teal'c!

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, A PASSAGEWAY

   [Teal'c stops and turns as he hears Carter cry out.]

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill is still in the grips of the men trying to kill him, while
   Carter is blocked by other prisoners and prevented from helping.
   Vishnor has Daniel in a chokehold, and Daniel passes out. Linea raises
   some sort of handheld device and it activates. Hit by some energy that
   it sends out, Vishnor groans and collapses, and he and Daniel fall to
   the ground. Teal'c enters the room and kidney punches the man who has
   O'Neill in a chokehold. Freed, O'Neill joins Teal'c in fighting off the
   mob, and Teal'c is stabbed in the side. Linea shuts down her device.
   The crowd subdued, Carter bursts through the men who had been blocking
   her way and rushes to Daniel's side. O'Neill and Teal'c follow.]

   [Daniel is curled up unconscious on the steps near the Stargate. The
   body of Vishnor lies nearby.]

     CARTER

     (checking Daniel's pulse)
     He's still alive. But just barely.

   [She cards her fingers through Daniel's hair.]

   INT--TALDOR PLANET--THE TAL'AL (SPEAKING AREA)

   [Hammond and Kovacek stand under the bright light.]

     FEMALE VOICE
     You are most punctual.

     KOVACEK
     Thank you.

     MALE VOICE
     You are the one called General Hammond?

     HAMMOND
     Yes. I am responsible for those people you have imprisoned.

     KOVACEK

     Ah, by using the word "responsible", the general is in no way
     assuming accountability for the actions of SG-1.
     (quietly to the General)
     Begging your pardon, sir, but I don't want you to end up in prison
     along with them.

     HAMMOND
     On the contrary, I would gladly hold myself responsible. I ordered
     them to this world in the first place.

     FEMALE VOICE
     Is this an admission of guilt?

     KOVACEK
     No.

     HAMMOND

     (to the Major)
     Yes, it is.
     (to the Taldor)
     As a matter of fact, if you would allow me to take the place of
     SG-1--

     MALE VOICE
     You ordered them to aid a murderer?

     HAMMOND
     No.

     FEMALE VOICE
     Then you're not guilty.

     MALE VOICE
     Not guilty.

     FEMALE VOICE
     Assumption of guilt by proxy is rejected.

     HAMMOND

     (strongly)
     If my people are not released, the imprisonment of the members of
     SG-1 will be considered a hostile act. Peaceful relations between
     our two worlds will end, right here, right now.

     MALE VOICE
     Our law is immutable.

     HAMMOND
     Your law is unjust.

     KOVACEK
     Sir, I'm not sure if this is--

     HAMMOND

     (demanding)
     What's it going to be?

     FEMALE VOICE
     Release is impossible.

     HAMMOND

     (angrily)
     Why?

     MALE VOICE
     There are no returns from Hadante...for anyone.

   [Hammond glares at Kovacek in frustration.]

   INT--THE PRISON HADANTE, LINEA'S QUARTERS

   [Daniel is lying unconscious on the bed. Linea is sitting on the edge
   of the bed is tending to him. She places a few drops of her
   "activators" into his mouth.]

     LINEA
     There. I have done what I can.

   [She stands up and moves over to the newest prison arrival. Carter is
   also seated on the bed. O'Neill and Teal'c look on.]

     CARTER

     (to Linea)
     I don't understand what happened.

     LINEA
     Your friend prevailed.

   [Carter's eyes widen in disbelief as Daniel stirs slightly on the bed.
   Teal'c seems doubtful, as well.]

     LINEA

     (to the blind prisoner)
     What is your name?

     SIMIAN
     Simian. I took food. I was hungry, starving. They sent me here.

     LINEA
     Hold still.

   [Linea leans his head back and examines his eyes.]

     CARTER
     He's blind.

     LINEA
     Yes. But not always so.

     SIMIAN
     It was taken from me a little each day.

   [Linea selects one of her activators.]

     LINEA

     (to Simian)
     There will be pain.

   [She places drops into his eyes, Simian claws at them, momentarily
   moaning in pain. Then he blinks and opens them fully, now able to see.
   He looks up somewhat excitedly, then, upon seeing Linea, he shrinks in
   fear, whimpers, and starts to run away, stopping for a moment at the
   door, looking back, then turning to run off again. All watch him.]

     LINEA
     His eyes now see.

     O'NEILL

     (to the retreating figure)
     You're welcome.

     TEAL'C
     He does not seem grateful.

     DANIEL
     Uhh...

     CARTER

     (turns to face him)
     Daniel?

   [Slowly, Daniel rises from the bed, still weak.]

     DANIEL
     Unh. What happened?

   [Going over to the bed, O'Neill sits down next to him and rubs Daniel's
   arm.]

     O'NEILL

     (in an Irish brogue)
     Well, ya actually won a fight, Danny-boy.

     DANIEL
     I don't particularly remember getting the upper hand.

     CARTER
     Neither do I, but you must have.

     DANIEL
     P2A-509.

   [Carter and O'Neill exchange glances.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     Little brain damage along the way?

     DANIEL
     No, uh-uh, SG-3 was scheduled to go on a mission to P2A-509. General
     Hammond said so in our last planning briefing. We rendezvous with
     SG-3, and we use their remote transmitters to get home.

     O'NEILL
     And this just came to you?

     DANIEL
     No. This came to me while I was suffocating.

     O'NEILL

     Then P2A-509 it is.
     (getting to his feet)
     Linea? Do they send food--and I'll use that term loosely--does it
     come through the Gate on a regular basis?

     LINEA
     Every day, at the same time.

     O'NEILL

     All right. That's our window.
     (to Carter)
     Will that work?

     CARTER

     (Nodding)
     Power the Gate and manually dial in while the other prisoners are
     off eating.

   INT--HADANTE GATE ROOM

   [Gate activates and prisoners position the chute and the vat as before.
   The food pours in from the wormhole, and SG-1 and Linea stand by with
   their bowls in hand. All the other prisoners just stand back waiting.]

     DANIEL
     What are they waiting for?

     TEAL'C
     They believe you killed Vishnor.

     LINEA
     You must distribute the food.

   [Daniel cautiously walks up to the vat. Linea follows close behind with
   her bowl. Daniel turns and takes Linea's bowl from her, dips and bows
   to her as he returns her bowl. As she walks away, the others prisoners
   begin to crowd the vat.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

   [The prisoners stop, and Daniel points uncertainly to his teammates.]

     DANIEL
     They're first.

   [His teammates look from one to the other, and Daniel motions with his
   head to move on over to the vat. O'Neill gestures to Carter to go
   first, and Carter goes and dips her bowl and moves off. Teal'c is next,
   he looks down at the slop, gives Daniel a half glance and moves off
   without partaking. O'Neill moves up and glowers at Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     Thank you.

   [Daniel smiles amusedly as O'Neill bends down and scoops out some food.
   When O'Neill is upright again, he stares at Daniel for a moment, who
   flashes a smile at him, then walks away. Daniel scoops a bowl for
   himself, then turns and looks at the prisoners.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, well, I guess--

   [The others all shout and jostle him trying to get at the food, and
   Daniel scoots out of the way. The prisoners all scoop and run. As soon
   as they're out of sight, SG-1 and Linea start rigging up the Stargate,
   wrapping it with the Terra-root. Linea drips her activators on the
   Terra-root plant. Simian walks in and sees what they're doing. The
   Terra-root plants are powering up and glowing.]

     CARTER
     Okay, that's it.

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     Address?

   [Simian ducks behind a wall still watching SG-1 and Linea while the
   other prisoners eat. The Stargate activates while the Scavenger also
   looks on. Daniel steps up and runs through the Gate first, with Carter
   helping Linea, Teal'c and O'Neill go through. Carter takes Linea's hand
   and they go through the Gate. Simian steps out from the shadows.]

     SCAVENGER

     (yelling)
     Escape! Escape!

   [Other prisoners hear, and rush to the Gate. Simian runs and throws
   himself at the event horizon. The Scavenger is joined by the other
   prisoners as they rush for the Gate, but the wormhole collapses on
   them. They stand dejected and groaning in frustration.]

     SCAVENGER
     No!

   [The others walk away.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [With klaxons sounding, General Hammond enters the Gate room. The
   wormhole collapses and SG-1 and Linea are walking down the ramp. They
   stop before Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     Where in the name of heaven did you come from?

     O'NEILL
     Prison, actually. We just broke out.

     HAMMOND

     (flabbergasted)
     Well, how? Your remote transmitters have been returned to us. SG-9
     and I spent the last two days trying to negotiate your release. With
     no luck, I might add.

     DANIEL
     Well, actually, we returned via P2A-509.

     CARTER
     Daniel remembered that SG-3 would be there, sir. Major Warren found
     us and was good enough to let us borrow a transmitter to open the
     iris.

     HAMMOND

     (Indicating Linea)
     And if I may ask?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, I'm sorry. General Hammond, this is Linea.

     CARTER
     We wouldn't have gotten out without her, sir.

   [Linea nods a greeting.]

     HAMMOND
     Then we owe you a great debt, ma'am. Welcome to the SGC.

     LINEA
     I've never seen such a place. It seems so alien.

     TEAL'C
     So it was with me, but over time it has become--home.

     CARTER
     General Hammond, sir, with your permission I'd like to offer Linea
     quarters here at the base.

   [General Hammond looks to O'Neill to see his take on the
   request--O'Neill is at best unsure.]

     CARTER
     There is a great deal she has to teach us. In fact, I brought back
     samples of a root that with Linea's activators can generate--

     HAMMOND
     I'll take that into consideration, Captain. In the meantime, I'd
     like you all to report to the infirmary, including your guest.

   [Daniel and Teal'c move off to the infirmary.]

     HAMMOND
     Begging your pardon ma'am, it's merely precautionary.

     LINEA
     I would do the same.

     HAMMOND
     We'll debrief after you've all had a chance to rest.

     O'NEILL

     Yes sir.
     (taking Linea's hand)
     Linea, thank you.

   [Linea smiles and nods, then follows Carter.]

   INT--SGC, CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter and Linea are standing wearing clean fatigues, while Dr. Greene
   looks on.]

     LINEA
     You spoke of a machine for storing data.

     CARTER
     Yeah. Right here.

   [Indicating the computer, Carter sits down and logs in.]

     LINEA
     You have a way of representing the basics?

     CARTER
     Molecules and atoms. Yes. Sit down.

   [Carter rises, offering Linea her chair. Linea sits down at the
   computer, and Carter hands her a pen mouse.]

     CARTER
     Just use this.

     LINEA
     If I give you the basic structure of my activators, can you
     fabricate them?

   [Carter smiles her assent.]

   side of him and Teal'c is standing off to the side. O'Neill's neck
   shows bruising from the cord that was used to try to strangle him.]

     O'NEILL
     Of course, that was about the time Daniel picked a fight with this
     big, smelly guy. He actually won.

   [There is a poounding on the door.]

     HAMMOND
     Enter.

   [Major Warren enters, leading Simian into the room. Simian is cuffed.]

     WARREN
     I found him lurking near our base camp, sir. You need to hear this.

     General, this is the...former blind man I was telling you about.

     SIMIAN

     (to O'Neill)
     The first thing I see, The Destroyer of Worlds.

     HAMMOND
     Excuse me?

     SIMIAN

     (to Hammond)
     She created a sickness. The one you call Linea. She--the Destroyer.

   [O'Neill and Daniel exchange confused glances.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Hammond)
     Uh, she told Carter there was a plague. She offered to help.

     SIMIAN
     Not help. She started it.

     Theoretically, even more than that. We've charted several hundred
     already, so far we've only visited a fraction of them.

     DR. GREENE
     We've discovered that most of the worlds in the network can sustain
     human life.

     LINEA
     Where is the repository of this knowledge?

     CARTER
     It's all in the computers. I'll show you.

   [Simian is seated under guard at the table.]

     SIMIAN
     Our island states were at war, she created a sickness, one she
     couldn't get herself. A terrible sickness.

     HAMMOND
     Go on.

     SIMIAN
     Half our people died. She came, promised to save the rest. By then
     it had spread, island to island. By the time they caught her, she
     had destroyed half a world.

   [O'Neill looks on worriedly.]

   INT--SGC--CARTER'S LAB

   [Linea is quickly scanning the computer files for Stargate addresses.
   She's typing like an expert; Carter, Doctor Greene, and the guard are
   collapsed on the floor near her.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Hammond, O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel are walking. When they hear the
   klaxons go off and the Stargate dialing, they break into a run.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond rushes in and runs up the stairs. O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel
   are close behind.]

     HAMMOND
     What's going on?

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     Unauthorized Gate activation.

   [A view of the computer monitor indicates chevrons locking in place.]

     HAMMOND
     Abort countdown. Get a team to the Gate room.

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     It's sealed, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Unseal it. Colonel O'Neill, affect the manual override.

   [O'Neill nods his agreement and starts to type at a keyboard while more
   chevrons lock. Carter and Dr. Greene run into the room.]

     DANIEL

     (to Carter)
     Where's Linea?

     DR. GREENE
     When we came to, she was gone.

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN

     (as chevrons finish locking)
     Wormhole has been activated.

     HAMMOND
     You were unconscious?

     DR. GREENE
     Only for a few minutes.

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     The abort command is not responding, sir.

   [A monitor counts down from 34 seconds. Carter takes a seat at one of
   the computers to help. The blast door raises. Linea is on the ramp at
   the event horizon.]

     HAMMOND

     (Into the microphone)
     Step away from that Gate.
     (to technician)
     Shut it down.

   [The female technician enters a code.]

     COMPUTER VOICE
     Self-destruct in 30 seconds.

   [The technician's monitor flashes "Access Denied".]

     O'NEILL
     It won't take our codes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Close the iris.

     COMPUTER VOICE
     Self-destruct in 20 seconds.

   [Linea looks back from the event horizon.]

     HAMMOND
     Try shutting the whole system down.

     CARTER
     We can't, sir. She's gone into the computer. She got the
     coordinates. Everything.

   [Linea stands there still, then turns and walks into the event
   horizon.]

     COMPUTER VOICE
     Self-destruct in 10 seconds.

   [The technician is desperately keying in numbers.]

     COMPUTER VOICE
     9... 8...7

   [The monitor continues to read "Access Denied".]

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN

     (shaking her head)
     The codes have been erased.

     COMPUTER VOICE
     5...

     CARTER
     This doesn't make any sense.

   [O'Neill looks at her.]

     COMPUTER VOICE
     4...3...2...1

   [The Gate shuts down, and they all wait for a few moments, but nothing
   happens. Hammond looks at O'Neill, and O'Neill to Hammond.]

     O'NEILL

     (To the technician)
     Redial those coordinates. Request permission to go after her.

     HAMMOND

     (simultaneously)
     Granted.

   [Suddenly, the room darkens as the system blacks out.]

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     The entire system just crashed.

     O'NEILL
     Well, get it back up!

     CARTER
     Colonel?

   [Carter's computer screen displays a message being typed out. The
   message says "Thank you for your kindness. All debts have now been
   paid." They stare dumbfounded at the screen.]

     CARTER

     (anxious)
     We let her out.

     DANIEL
     The Destroyer of Worlds.

   [They all look out at the darkened Gate room ominously. Fade to black]

   FADE OUT
