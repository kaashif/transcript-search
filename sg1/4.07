   FADE IN

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [A fully geared up SG-1 is walking down the corridor to the Gate room.]

     CARTER
     The MALP readings indicate a very low UV level. All other
     indications suggest a positive environment.

     O'NEILL
     Sounds good.

   [They enter the Gate room to the sound of the Gate activating.]

     DANIEL
     It's going to take us two weeks to get the Enkarans fully
     transplanted.

     TEAL'C
     If the planet proves to be suitable.

     DANIEL
     It better be, they're running out of time.

   [They wait at the foot of the ramp for the Gate to open. The seventh
   chevron falls into place, but the Gate doesn't open. O'Neill turns to
   look at Sgt Davis in the control room.]

     DAVIS
     Chevron seven won't engage.

   [All of SG-1 turn around to look at the control room. O'Neill looks at
   Carter who nods and goes to help in the control room.]

     DAVIS

     (to Carter)
     I don't understand it, the diagnostic shows no problems.

   [Carter looks at the computer display, which reads 'total errors = 0']

     CARTER

     (on speaker)
     Sir, this is going to take a while.

   [She starts working on the computers.]

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Gate is still inactive.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is sitting at the console with Sgt Davis. Hammond and the rest
   of SG-1 are standing nearby.]

     CARTER
     It looks like there was an energy spike in our power log about eight
     minutes before we first tried dialing out.

   [Daniel looks at Teal'c in surprise.]

     DANIEL
     Err, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that something we've seen
     before when another Gate is being used on Earth?

     O'NEILL
     Like when Maybourne's NID guys had the other Gate.

     TEAL'C
     There is no longer a second Stargate on Earth.

     HAMMOND
     Ours was destroyed along with Thor's ship.

     CARTER
     But if there was another Gate and its use was responsible for the
     energy spike, there might be a corresponding seismic tremor, like
     when the Gate was found in Antarctica.

     DAVIS
     I've got something.

   [A computer screen shows a map of Siberia and surrounding countries. A
   dot is flashing in the center of the map. O'Neill moves to look at the
   screen.]

     CARTER
     There was a minor seismic event that matches the time in our power
     log exactly.

     O'NEILL
     Is that Siberia?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir, and there's only one explanation I can think of.

     DANIEL
     The Russians have a Stargate!

   END OF TEASER

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill is standing looking out on some airmen running diagnostics on
   the Gate. He walks over to the table as Hammond enters and they sit
   down.]

     HAMMOND
     The Russians recovered the Stargate from the bottom of the ocean.

     O'NEILL
     I though we swept that whole area.

     HAMMOND
     We're talking about hundreds of square miles, Colonel. The Russian
     navy was on alert because they picked up Thor's ship on satellite.
     They must have got lucky and beat us to it.

     CARTER
     And they're admitting this?

     HAMMOND
     We didn't give them much choice, Major. The Pentagon said we had the
     evidence that could prove it.

     DANIEL
     Obviously they figured out how to use it.

     CARTER
     It took us years!

     HAMMOND
     Apparently the Russians know quite a bit about the SGC.

     O'NEILL

     (suspiciously)
     How?

     HAMMOND
     They didn't say. How they got it open isn't the issue right now,
     either. The problem is it won't close.

     DANIEL
     Well, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, shouldn't it eventually
     shut down on its own?

     TEAL'C
     Even the Goa'uld themselves have not been able to sustain a wormhole
     for longer than thirty-eight minutes.

     O'NEILL
     What about another black hole planet?

     O'NEILL
     We would detect a gravitational anomaly, sir.

   [He looks at her, annoyed that his good idea was wrong.]

     HAMMOND
     The Russian government is divided on how to deal with the situation.
     It seems the Russian president didn't support setting up a Stargate
     program in the first place. Until we called they were planning on
     bombing the facility and covering the whole thing up.

     O'NEILL
     And now?

     HAMMOND
     One of the Russian scientists involved in starting the program
     convinced them to send in a team to assess the situation and
     determine if it can be resolved in another way.

     CARTER
     Who's the scientist?

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Svetlana Markov.

   [Carter looks surprised.]

     CARTER
     Wow, I know her work, she's brilliant.

     HAMMOND
     She knows about you too, Major. To that end she's convinced Moscow
     to let SG-1 be the team that goes to Siberia.

   [O'Neill doesn't look too convinced.]

     O'NEILL
     You're kidding?

     HAMMOND
     Jack, I'm thankful they're smart enough to realize this has global
     implications and that you are the foremost experts on the Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     General, we'd be walking into an unknown situation to save their
     rosy butts!

     DANIEL

     (to O'Neill)
     Err...we can't use our Gate until they get their's shut down.

     CARTER
     Not to mention the potential danger of having an open wormhole
     between Earth and who knows where.

     HAMMOND
     You'll rendezvous with Dr. Markov in Russia and proceed to the base
     from there.

   [O'Neill rolls his eyes, obviously unhappy with the situation.]

   EXT--RUSSIAN AIRBASE--KYUBYSHEV

   [A USAF airplane is on the runway, being checked over by airmen. SG-1
   are standing beside it, dressed in cold weather gear. A jeep drives up
   beside it and a woman gets out and walks over to Carter and O'Neill,
   smiling.]

     O'NEILL
     Dr. Markov, I presume?

     MARKOV
     Sorry I'm late.

     CARTER
     Doctor, it's an honor. I've read your work.

   [They shake hands.]

     MARKOV
     And I yours, Major Carter. I had hoped we would meet under different
     circumstances.

     O'NEILL

     (offering his hand)
     Jack O'Neill

   [Markov looks at him for a moment.]

     MARKOV
     Yes...

   [She looks at Daniel and Teal'c who are standing to the side.]

     MARKOV
     Dr. Daniel Jackson and Teal'c.

   [They all look surprised that she knows them. Teal'c gives a slight bow
   to her in acknowledgment.]

     CARTER
     How do you know about the SGC?

     MARKOV
     I have read extensive files on all of you.

     O'NEILL
     The question was...how?

     MARKOV
     I learned to read English at the age of six. It was not difficult.

   [Carter looks at O'Neill and smiles.]

     O'NEILL
     Russian humor.

     MARKOV
     I will tell you what I can on the way.

   [They all follow her onto the plane.]

   EXT--RUSSIAN AIRBASE--KYUBYSHEV

   [The USAF airplane takes off from the runway.]

   INT--USAF AIRPLANE

   [The plane is airborne. Carter joins O'Neill, Daniel and Markov who are
   sitting on benches along the sides. They are wearing headsets to
   communicate over the engine noise.]

     MARKOV
     I was first contacted shortly after Russian satellites picked up
     what we believed was an alien spaceship entering the atmosphere.

   [Daniel looks at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Alien spaceship, huh?

     MARKOV
     About two months ago. It disintegrated during entry and crashed into
     the Pacific. The Stargate was recovered after an extensive sweep of
     the ocean floor. During that search one of our Foxtrot submarines
     went missing. You may be familiar with the incident.

   [She looks at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Not a clue.

   [Markov looks at him, probably knowing he was on the submarine.]

     MARKOV
     I was assigned as chief science officer, second in command to
     Colonel Sarkalov. We've been in operation for 37 days, albeit
     against the wishes of certain very powerful people in the
     government.

     CARTER
     What did they want to do?

     MARKOV
     They threatened to expose the existence of your program.

     O'NEILL
     To what end?

     MARKOV
     To get the US to share the technology you have obtained.

   [O'Neill raises his eyebrows at her.]

     CARTER
     So what stopped them?

     MARKOV
     We activated our Gate. I convinced the military that we could
     benefit from our own program more than we could trust you.

   [O'Neill looks at her with a smirk on his face.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

     DANIEL
     How did you activate it?

     MARKOV
     We have a dialing device.

   [Daniel looks surprised.]

     DANIEL
     The DHD, you found the one from Giza!

   [Teal'c approaches and sits down next to Daniel.]

     MARKOV
     It was confiscated from the Germans after the Second World War.

     CARTER
     Well, now I understand how you can send your people through and get
     them to return to your Gate instead of ours.

     O'NEILL
     That makes one of us.

   [Markov looks at him.]

     MARKOV
     Our Gate superseded yours as long as the dialing device was
     connected. We only kept it connected when we were using it, to
     prevent any crossover. It required precise timing, but it worked.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Until now.

     MARKOV
     As for the current situation, I really don't know what has happened.
     There has been no contact with the base since yesterday at twelve
     hundred hours.

   [The co-pilot walks up to O'Neill.]

     CO-PILOT
     Sir, we have a visual from the target runway. It appears to be iced
     over and there's no response from the control tower.

     MARKOV
     We're going to have to jump.

   [Daniel looks at O'Neill, panicked.]

     DANIEL
     Out of the plane?

   [Teal'c looks unsure and Carter closes her eyes at the thought.]

     MARKOV
     I'm going, with or without you, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     I suppose you expect my male bravado to kick in right about now?

     MARKOV
     I read your file.

     O'NEILL
     No mention of bravado, eh?

     MARKOV
     There are forty-seven people down there who may need our help.

   [O'Neill leans forward.]

     O'NEILL

     (seriously)
     Look, you don't have to tell me what's at stake here. We've got
     seven teams off world who can't get home until we fix what you
     screwed up.

   [O'Neill leans forward and speaks down his headset at the co-pilot.]

     O'NEILL
     Stu...gear em up...for a jump.

   [He stands up to get ready. Daniel is nervously sitting on the bench
   looking at O'Neill. The co-pilot gives everyone a parachute. Teal'c
   looks at his in confusion.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not understand, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     It's called a parachute.

   [Carter looks up from getting ready.]

     CARTER
     It slows your descent after you jump out of the plane.

   [Teal'c seems unconvinced.]

     TEAL'C
     This device appears to be poorly designed to perform such a
     function.

     O'NEILL
     It opens after you jump...don't worry about it, I've done it
     hundreds of times.

     MARKOV
     I assume you've brought haz-mat.

   [O'Neill looks at her and speaks sarcastically.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, we thought somebody should be prepared.

   [Markov looks at Carter in frustration.]

     MARKOV
     Is he always like this?

     CARTER
     Actually, this is quite charming.

   [Markov rolls her eyes at this.]

   [The plane doors open. Two airmen drop a crate of supplies out of the
   plane on a parachute. Then SG-1 and Markov approach the doorway. Teal'c
   appears very apprehensive as he walks to the doorway with O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     It's easy, just jump, then pull this.

   [He indicates the parachute release wire.]

     TEAL'C
     This does not seem wise, O'Neill!

     O'NEILL
     I said it was easy, not wise.

     MARKOV
     If we get separated, we'll rendezvous at the base.

   [She jumps out of the plane, followed by Carter.]

     TEAL'C
     This does not seem wise!

   [O'Neill gives him a little push and he jumps. Daniel approaches
   O'Neill and gives him an apprehensive look before jumping. O'Neill then
   jumps himself.]

   EXT--SIBERIA

   [There is a large building surrounded by snow covered mountains.
   O'Neill, Carter and Markov are making their way to the building.]

     O'NEILL

     (on radio)
     Teal'c, Daniel come in....
     (To Carter and Markov)
     There's been no response on the radios.

     MARKOV
     Their signals may be blocked if they are already inside.

   [They continue on towards the building.]

   INT--RUSSIAN STARGATE COMPLEX

   [O'Neill, Carter and Markov open the large entrance doors and
   cautiously enter with their weapons drawn. They are all wearing gas
   masks.]

     MARKOV
     Up there.

   [She indicates above them.]

     O'NEILL

     (on radio)
     Teal'c, Daniel do you read?

     TEAL'C

     (on radio)
     I am here.

     O'NEILL
     Where?

   [O'Neill, Carter and Markov make their way up some stairs. The building
   is in darkness, except for flashing red alarm lights.]

     TEAL'C
     In the facility.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I'm here too.

     O'NEILL
     Where?

     DANIEL
     Well, I don't know exactly. Where are you?

     O'NEILL
     We just got inside, hang tight.

   [They reach the top of the stairs and walk along the platform.]

     CARTER
     I'm picking up trace amounts of chlorine.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah?

     CARTER
     Nothing dangerous at these levels, sir.

   [O'Neill looks around the area.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, what is this place?

     CARTER
     It obviously wasn't built specifically for the Stargate program.

     MARKOV
     It was an experimental power station.

     CARTER
     Experimental?

     MARKOV
     All that I am allowed to say is that it was decommissioned two years
     ago.

     O'NEILL

     (under his breath)
     Oh please!

     CARTER
     Are there lights?

     MARKOV
     The power appears to have been diverted from all non-essential base
     functions. This way to the main control center.

   [They walk ahead and then hear footsteps approaching. O'Neill crouches
   forward quietly. A figure walks towards them quietly with a torch.]

     O'NEILL

     (on radio)
     Daniel, is that you?

     DANIEL

     (on radio)
     I don't know. I'm walking down a long corridor.

     O'NEILL

     (on radio)
     Which one?

   [The figure gets close and O'Neill shines his torch at the figure. It
   is Daniel and he looks at them, surprised.]

     DANIEL
     This one!

   [Markov stands and walks past Daniel.]

     MARKOV
     This way.

     DANIEL
     Actually you might wanna see this first.

   INT--RUSSIAN STARGATE FACILITY

   [Teal'c turns over a man's body. The man has been shot several times.
   There are other bodies in the corridor. Markov and the rest of SG-1
   approach.]

     TEAL'C
     These three were shot. I am unaware of how the others died.

     MARKOV
     These doors lead to the Stargate.

   [She goes to a set of heavy doors and types in a pass code on the lock.
   She then runs an ID card through the sensor and the lock releases.
   Markov pushes the door open to reveal the active Stargate. There are
   more dead bodies surrounding the Gate. Markov slowly looks around and
   checks the bodies, followed by SG-1.]

     MARKOV

     (quietly)
     They're all dead.

   INT--RUSSIAN CONTROL ROOM

   [Markov and SG-1 descend some stairs into the room. A man's body is
   slumped in a chair at the main console. Markov looks at him.]

     MARKOV
     I need this station.

   [Teal'c and Daniel move the body to one side. Markov starts the base
   computers up and reads the information. She takes her gas mask off and
   we see that she is crying.]

     MARKOV
     It's safe.

   [Teal'c removes his mask and breathes in.]

     TEAL'C
     The air is indeed clean.

   [The rest of SG-1 remove their masks. Carter places a hand on Markov's
   shoulder. Markov is clearly upset.]

     CARTER
     Are you ok?

     MARKOV
     I knew these men and women, Major, some of them quite well.

   [Markov continues working at the computer.]

     O'NEILL
     So what happened here?

     MARKOV
     Colonel Sarkalov enacted the extreme measures protocol.

     DANIEL
     What's that?

     MARKOV
     The Stargate room is sealed and substance thirty-five is released
     throughout the base.

   [O'Neill looks around blankly.]

     CARTER
     Nerve gas.

     O'NEILL
     Nerve gas!

     MARKOV
     It's ok, Colonel. It's a non-persistent gas, it evaporates after
     three hours.

   [O'Neill shakes his head unconvinced.]

     MARKOV
     According to the computer the protocol was enacted yesterday.

     TEAL'C
     For what reason?

     MARKOV
     The computer log doesn't say.

     O'NEILL
     All right, people were shooting each another around here before they
     got gassed. I wanna know why.

     DANIEL
     I'll see what we can find out.

   [He looks at Teal'c. Markov grabs some pieces of paper and hands them
   to Daniel.]

     MARKOV
     This is a list of all personnel assigned to the base. They should
     all be wearing ID tags.

   [Daniel and Teal'c leave the control room as Markov continues on the
   computer.]

     O'NEILL
     So, what about the Gate?

     MARKOV

     It's an outgoing wormhole but...
     (she looks at the computer readout)
     That doesn't make sense. The EM protocol cuts off the dialing
     device. If the protocol was enacted yesterday, where has the
     outgoing wormhole been drawing its power from since then?

     CARTER
     We've seen one drawing power from the source of the destination.

     MARKOV
     Of course! The black hole incident.

   [Carter and O'Neill exchange surprised looks.]

     O'NEILL
     Is there anything you don't know?

   [Markov ignores this and continues with the computer.]

     MARKOV
     What were they doing?

   [She stands up and runs out of the room followed by O'Neill and
   Carter.]

   INT--RUSSIAN COMPLEX

   [Markov rushes towards a large storage device. She climbs the ladder at
   the side of it and opens the top, looking for something.]

     MARKOV

     (annoyed)
     It's gone!

   [O'Neill and Carter approach.]

     O'NEILL
     If I ask what and you say it's classified...I'm going to shoot ya!

     MARKOV
     The seventh address we successfully dialed led to a Stargate
     entirely submerged under water. We sent a reconnaissance drone and
     found a dialing device, so it was decided that a manned mini
     submarine would go next. A sample of the water was retrieved. It
     seemed to have unbelievable properties.

     CARTER
     Like what?

     MARKOV
     It was spontaneously emitting energy in the form of heat. If this
     liquid turned out to be an abundant clean energy source...

     CARTER
     Err, that doesn't seem possible.

     MARKOV
     I was called away to Moscow before I could perform any significant
     analysis.

     CARTER
     So, now you're saying the water sample is gone?

     MARKOV
     Yes. There was a sealed container being kept in this containment
     vessel.

     CARTER
     And the Stargate is dialed into the water planet now?

     MARKOV
     Apparently, but that doesn't make sense. They were supposed to
     continue on to the next two planets on our planned sequence and not
     revisit the water planet until I got back.

     CARTER
     Let's confirm it. Do you have another reconnaissance drone?

     MARKOV
     We left the first one there.

   [She climbs down from the container.]

     MARKOV
     All we have to do is reactivate the receiver.

   [They all head back to the control room.]

   INT--GATE ROOM OF RUSSIAN COMPLEX

   [Daniel and Teal'c are trying to identify the bodies of the Russian SGC
   personnel. Daniel retrieves some ID tags off one of the bodies.]

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Daniel, Teal'c?

   [Daniel activates his radio and talks into it.]

     DANIEL
     Err, what's up?

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Head back to the control room. Dr. Markov thinks you might want to
     see this.

   [Daniel looks at Teal'c.]

   INT--RUSSIAN CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel and Teal'c walk down the stairs into the room. Markov walks
   over to them. Carter is sitting at a computer terminal and O'Neill is
   checking over the bodies of two people slumped over computer consoles.]

     TEAL'C
     Thus far we have accounted for twenty-eight of the forty-seven names
     on the list.

   [Daniel hands her the paper with the names on.]

     DANIEL
     Six of them were dressed as civilians not soldiers. They were all
     shot and there was no apparent reason why.

     MARKOV
     They were the scientists working in the lab.

     O'NEILL
     So the guys experimenting on that water gave the soldiers reason to
     shoot.

     MARKOV
     So it seems.

   [She walks to another computer terminal.]

     DANIEL

     (confused)
     What water?

     CARTER
     It was a sample brought back from a planet where the Stargate was
     submerged.

     MARKOV
     I thought you might be interested, Dr. Jackson.

   [Daniel and the others walk over.]

     MARKOV
     We found some unusual ruins from an obviously extinct civilization
     on the ocean's floor. Recording signal from the reconnaissance
     drone.

   [She works at the computer and we see the drone's recording of the
   underwater ruins.]

     DANIEL
     Can you get close?

     MARKOV
     The drone is malfunctioning. I can only pan and tilt.

   [The camera pans and bodies come into view. Markov stares at the screen
   in shock.]

     TEAL'C
     Why would those men proceed through the Stargate knowing they would
     drown on the other side?

   [O'Neill shakes his head.]

     CARTER

     (standing up)
     Can you shut off the drone's transmitter from here?

     MARKOV
     Why?

     CARTER
     Well, even though the wormhole only allows matter to travel one way
     we are able to transmit radio signals back and forth.

     MARKOV
     You think the drone's radio transmitter is what is keeping the Gate
     open?

     CARTER
     That Gate won't close if the drone is aiming a strong enough signal
     directly into the event horizon.

     MARKOV
     And the energy being emitted by the water has allowed the Gate to
     stay open this long.

     CARTER
     Exactly, it's a combination of factors but all we have to do is shut
     off the drone.

   [Markov attempts to shut off the drone. The screen flashes red.]

     MARKOV
     It's not responding to my command, I can't shut it down.

     CARTER
     How long before its batteries die?

     MARKOV
     The drone is nuclear powered.

   [O'Neill looks up surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     A nuclear powered drone?

     MARKOV
     We built several of them, we thought we might want to leave them on
     other planets for long term observation.

     CARTER
     How long term?

   [Markov looks at Carter and O'Neill anxiously.]

     MARKOV
     Ten years.

   [O'Neill looks at Carter, annoyed.]

   INT--RUSSIAN BASE

   [Markov is removing some covering sheets from a small submarine. SG-1
   are standing to one side observing.]

     MARKOV
     It will be simple to deactivate the drone from the other side.

     CARTER
     Once it stops transmitting its signal the wormhole should close.

     DANIEL
     I'd like to get a closer look at those ruins.

     O'NEILL
     How many people does that thing hold?

     MARKOV
     Three.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Oh darn...I've never been in a submarine before.

   [He looks at Markov and she looks at Carter, clearly annoyed with his
   attitude.]

   INT-SUBMARINE

   [Carter, Daniel and Markov descend the ladder into the submarine. It is
   very small inside. Markov switches on all the systems as Carter and
   Daniel look around and take their seats.]

     DANIEL

     (sarcastically)
     Spacious, roomy, very nice.

   [Markov takes the pilot's seat and sets up the controls.]

     DANIEL
     So exactly how much air do we have in this thing?

     MARKOV
     Over a day's worth. We won't need more than an hour.

   [Daniel and Carter exchange apprehensive looks.]

   INT--RUSSIAN CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter. They see what is happening inside the
   submarine via a video link.]

     MARKOV

     (via link)
     Colonel, can you hear us?

   [O'Neill flips a switch so he can talk to them.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I read you.

     MARKOV
     Pressurizing and proceeding through the Gate.

   INT--RUSSIAN GATE ROOM

   [The submarine is being lifted and moved to the active Stargate. Once
   it is part way through the event horizon the wormhole supports its
   weight and it goes through on its own. O'Neill and Teal'c watch via the
   video link.]

     O'NEILL
     Good luck.

     CARTER

     (via link)
     Thank you.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET SUBMERGED IN WATER

   [The submarine exits the Stargate and moves forward.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Carter and Daniel look around, amazed.]

     CARTER
     Wow!

     MARKOV
     It is quite beautiful.

     DANIEL
     What?

     MARKOV
     The rapid pressurization might cause your ears to block.

   [Daniel clamps his hands over his nose and blows to pop his ears.]

     MARKOV
     As you might notice, there is no plant or animal life.

   [Daniel succeeds in clearing his ears.]

     DANIEL
     There doesn't appear to be any plant or animal life.

     CARTER

     (via radio)
     Colonel, do you read?

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are at a computer console, watching the video of
   the submarine.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah?

   [They see a video image of Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (via video)
     We're counting five bodies on this side.

     TEAL'C
     Which means there could still be several personnel unaccounted for.

     O'NEILL
     All right. We'll have another look around.

     MARKOV

     (via link)
     We're capturing the drone. Once it is inside the containment tank we
     can deactivate it, and if Major Carter is right the Gate will shut
     off. Ending transmission, over and out.

   [Markov leans over and cuts the transmission. The screen goes blank.
   The Stargate shuts down.]

     O'NEILL
     So let's have that look around.

   [They get up and leave the control room.]

   EXT--UNDERWATER

   [The submarine proceeds away from the Stargate.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Daniel, Carter and Markov are sitting in the sub as it proceeds away
   from the Stargate, exploring the surroundings.]

     MARKOV
     I'm glad you were right, Major.

     CARTER
     Well, it still doesn't explain why your soldiers started shooting
     the scientists who were experimenting on the water.

     MARKOV
     Or why those men were either forced through the Gate, or felt
     compelled to go through on their own, knowing that they would die.

     DANIEL
     Well, the existence of the ruins suggests the planet wasn't always
     completely submerged. Maybe there's some clues down there.

     MARKOV
     Let's have a look.

   [She steers towards the ruins. The engine sound increases and Markov
   looks at the readout, puzzled.]

     CARTER
     Something wrong?

     MARKOV
     The controls are getting heavy. I haven't touched the power, yet
     we're slowing down.

     CARTER
     Strong current?

     MARKOV

     It's possible.
     (She makes adjustments at the controls)
     I'm pushing it to full power.

   [The engine sound increases as it fights to move forward faster. Markov
   stares at a reading that is counting down from 6. Daniel looks around,
   worried, and sniffs.]

     DANIEL
     What's that smell?

   [Carter sniffs the air too and looks around, worried.]

     MARKOV
     We've completely stopped!

   [Suddenly there is a bang and the engine in the back blows. There is a
   small fire in the rear of the submarine. They all jump and look around,
   alarmed.]

     DANIEL
     Err...fire!

   [They all stand and go towards the rear.]

     MARKOV
     Extinguisher.

   [She points at the small extinguishers and Daniel grabs one. He sprays
   it at the fire, puts it out and turns to Carter and Markov.]

     DANIEL
     It's out, we're ok.

   [Carter goes to look out of the front viewport at the surroundings
   while Markov inspects the damaged engine. Daniel looks around,
   worried.]

     DANIEL

     (to Markov)
     Can you fix it?

     MARKOV
     Yes.

   [Daniel walks over to where Carter is looking out of the viewport and
   stands next to her.]

     DANIEL
     What?

     CARTER
     If it was a strong current it should be pushing us back now.

     DANIEL
     But it's not.

     CARTER
     No, we're completely stationary. It's like we're stuck in the mud.

     DANIEL
     Without the mud.

   [They continue looking out of the viewport.]INT--RUSSIAN FACILITY

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are cautiously looking around the base. O'Neill
   stops suddenly and looks at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL

     (sniffing)
     What's that smell?

   INT--FACILITY KITCHEN

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter the large room slowly with their weapons
   drawn. The kitchen is a mess and there is a body on the floor. O'Neill
   looks at it and continues on. One of the ovens is still on and is
   smoking. O'Neill turns it off and then notices a trail of footprints
   leading to the large refrigerator. He raises his gun and hand signals
   to Teal'c to open the door. Teal'c crouches down and opens the door.
   O'Neill stands at the doorway with his gun aimed inside. A man stands
   inside, frozen. O'Neill and Teal'c look at him, shocked.]

     O'NEILL
     Holy frozen bad guys!

   [The frozen man is Colonel Maybourne.]

   EXT--UNDERWATER

   [The submarine is stationary, near the ruins.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Markov is in the back of the submarine, trying to fix the engine.
   Daniel comes up to the hatch behind her.]

     DANIEL
     How's it going?

     MARKOV
     I think I can fix it.

     DANIEL
     Wait, five minutes ago you said you could definitely fix it and now
     you just think you can?

   [Markov shakes her head, annoyed, and continues with the repairs.]

     MARKOV
     What do you want to hear? I don't understand why this happened.

     DANIEL
     Well, given the obvious solid craftsmanship that went into this
     thing, I don't see how this could have possibly happened.

     MARKOV
     If you're implying that everything Russian made is poor quality,
     actually the sub is Swiss.

     DANIEL
     So they occasionally catch fire but they keep perfect time?

   [Markov sighs and ignores his comment.]

     DANIEL

     Sorry,
     (murmuring)
     I've been hanging around Jack O'Neill too much.

   [He turns around and goes over to Carter.]

     MARKOV
     There was nothing impeding us! It shouldn't have happened.

     CARTER
     Well, here's something else that shouldn't be happening. The outside
     pressure is increasing.

   [Markov looks shocked and puts her tools down.]

     MARKOV
     What?

   [She runs to the controls in the front.]

     MARKOV
     The gauge must be malfunctioning.

     DANIEL

     (sarcastically)
     But it's Swiss.

   [Markov turns to look at him, annoyed.]

     CARTER
     Our depth is constant and pressure should be relative to depth.

     DANIEL
     And if it keeps increasing?

   [Carter and Markov turn to look at him.]

     CARTER
     The sub will implode.

   [They all look worried.]

   EXT--SIBERIAN MOUNTAINS

   [The Russian power station in the background.]

   INT--KITCHEN

   [O'Neill and Teal'c carry the frozen form of Maybourne out of the
   freezer and place him on a table.]

     TEAL'C
     Now we know how the Russians acquired their information.

   [O'Neill stares at Maybourne and taps his face to see how frozen he
   is.]

     O'NEILL
     Solid!

   [Suddenly Maybourne breathes out and O'Neill steps back in surprise
   with his handgun drawn.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa!

     TEAL'C
     Do not humans usually die when they are frozen?

     O'NEILL
     Usually.

   [They stare at Maybourne, who is continuing to breathe.]

     O'NEILL
     They usually don't breathe when they're dead either.

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Daniel is looking out of one of the small side viewports. He looks at
   Markov who is still in the back working on the engine.]

     DANIEL
     So Svetlana, could you go over exactly what happened last time you
     were here?

     MARKOV
     We came through the Stargate just as we did this time. We took the
     sub straight to the dialing device and redialed Earth. The Gate
     opened and we headed through.

     DANIEL
     That's it?

     MARKOV
     We collected the water sample just before heading back through the
     event horizon.

     CARTER
     No trouble?

     MARKOV
     We had to push the engines a little harder to get through the Gate
     but I expected it was some kind of intuitive countermeasure intended
     to keep the water from flowing through the Gate.

     CARTER
     It's possible. My research indicates that the Gate actually has the
     ability to use density of molecular structure, and the force being
     exerted on the event horizon, to determine whether something's
     actually trying to pass through.

     MARKOV
     I know, that's where I got the idea.

   [Suddenly the submarine starts creaking and they all look around,
   alarmed.]

   INT--KITCHEN

   [Maybourne's hand drops down from where it was frozen as he defrosts.
   O'Neill and Teal'c are observing this.]

     O'NEILL
     Maybourne?

   [There is no response.]

     TEAL'C
     His heart is beating, albeit slowly. He is getting warmer, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Maybourne!

   [Suddenly Maybourne looks from side to side.]

     O'NEILL
     You hear me?

   [Maybourne looks at O'Neill.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Markov is quickly trying to finish fixing the engine. She walks into
   the main compartment and sits down in front of the controls. Carter and
   Daniel take their seats. Markov powers up the sub and the engine
   strains to get the sub moving.]

     CARTER
     We're not going anywhere, are we?

   [Markov looks at her, then gets up and turns the engines off.]

     DANIEL
     What are you doing?

     MARKOV
     Pushing the engines harder will only burn them out again. Next time
     I may not be able to fix them.

     DANIEL
     And if we stay here we'll run out of air.

     MARKOV
     If the pressure keeps increasing at the current rate the sub will
     implode long before we run out of air.

     DANIEL
     Or that!

     CARTER
     I figure we have maybe an hour.

     MARKOV
     I agree. The front bubble will be most susceptible. It will be the
     first to go.

     DANIEL
     Err...can we stop agreeing on how we're going to die and start doing
     something about it?

   [Markov and Carter just stare around the sub., unsure of what to do.]

   INT--KITCHEN

   [Maybourne suddenly sits up, surprising O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, that's far enough.

   [Maybourne stares straight ahead and starts walking out of the
   kitchen.]

     O'NEILL

     Maybourne...
     (he raises his gun)
     Maybourne, stop!

   [Teal'c stands in the way of Maybourne to stop him from leaving the
   kitchen.]

     O'NEILL
     Move again and I'll shoot.

   [Maybourne turns around and starts to walk towards O'Neill. He suddenly
   stops and clutches at his chest, coughing. He drops to the floor and
   coughs up what appears to be water. O'Neill looks at him in disgust.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn!

   [Maybourne suddenly seems to come to his senses. He stares at the
   water, shocked.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Jack, the freezer!

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [He grabs Maybourne by the collar and aims his gun at him.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Move if you wanna live. Shoot me if you want to, we're dead if we
     don't move now!

   [O'Neill looks at Teal'c who is standing over the water.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

   [Suddenly the water turns into a vapor and Teal'c is forced to breathe
   it in. As this distracts O'Neill, Maybourne grabs the opportunity and
   shoves himself and O'Neill back inside the freezer, closing the door
   behind them. O'Neill struggles to get out past Maybourne.]

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing!

     MAYBOURNE
     Don't wait for him! Jack, you open that door and we're both dead, I
     swear! You can't help him.

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     Get the hell out of my way!

   [He pushes past Maybourne and looks through the window at Teal'c.
   Teal'c is standing, unmoving, until he suddenly looks up and walks off
   towards the Stargate room.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell's going on here?

   EXT--UNDERWATER

   [The submarine is still not moving in the 'water'.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Carter, Markov and Daniel are discussing the situation.]

     DANIEL
     You said it's like we're being held here.

     CARTER
     Like someone is squeezing the sub.

     MARKOV
     But there's only water out there.

   [The submarine is creaking from the increased pressure.]

     DANIEL

     (looking around)
     What if it's not water?

   [Markov looks as though she never considered that possibility.]

     CARTER
     Exactly what tests did you run on the sample when you brought it
     back?

     MARKOV
     As I said, we had begun preliminary analysis. It was being kept in a
     sealed container. It hadn't even been opened yet when I went away.

     CARTER
     How did you know it was giving off energy?

     MARKOV
     The container maintained a temperature several degrees above room
     temperature.

     CARTER
     And you never performed a chemical analysis?

     MARKOV
     I insisted the proper controls were set up. They were supposed to
     wait until I got back.

     CARTER
     But they didn't?

     MARKOV
     Colonel Sarkalov was under a lot of pressure to prove that the money
     being spent was going to be worth it.

     DANIEL
     So we don't know that's actually water out there!

   [The glass at the front viewport creaks and they all turn and stare at
   it.]

   INT--KITCHEN FREEZER

   [O'Neill looks out of the window with his gun ready. He looks at
   Maybourne who has his arms crossed at his chest.]

     MAYBOURNE
     It's alive.

   [O'Neill walks towards him angrily.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     MAYBOURNE
     The water. When they exposed it to the air to start a chemical
     analysis it just evaporated, turned into vapor.

     O'NEILL
     You were there?

     MAYBOURNE
     We inhaled it, didn't give us a choice.

     O'NEILL
     Who's us?

     MAYBOURNE
     The scientists in the lab. I knew what was going on but I couldn't
     control myself. They wanted to go back through the Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     Who's they?

   [Maybourne slowly approaches O'Neill.]

     MAYBOURNE
     Life forms, in the water. Countless numbers of microscopic
     organisms, intelligent life forms.

     O'NEILL
     Are you trying to tell me this water thinks?

     MAYBOURNE
     We were killing them. They forced us to try to take them back
     through the Gate. The soldiers tried to stop us, they were shooting.
     If an infected man was killed the fluid came out of him and more
     were infected. It was chaos. One of the infected soldiers managed to
     get to the DHD and get the Gate open. That's when the base commander
     enacted the EM protocol to stop it. The infected men started running
     through the Gate, trying to escape the gas.

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't you?

     MAYBOURNE
     I was cut off from the Gate room. I think the liquid organisms
     inside me knew the only way to keep themselves alive was to escape
     the gas and freeze themselves. They forced me in here.

     O'NEILL
     You were frozen solid when I found you.

     MAYBOURNE
     They kept me alive.

     O'NEILL

     (skeptically)
     How do you know all of this?

     MAYBOURNE
     I don't know how exactly, I just do. They must have communicated it
     to me.

     O'NEILL
     This is the stuff that's in Teal'c now?

   [Maybourne nods at him.]

     O'NEILL
     How do we get it out?

   [Maybourne shrugs his shoulders.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on Maybourne, it came out of you.

     MAYBOURNE
     They needed to go back. You wouldn't let me go. I guess they thought
     Teal'c could get them home.

   [O'Neill just shakes his head at Maybourne, opens the door and heads
   out after Teal'c.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [Carter and Markov are sitting, working at the console. Daniel is
   pacing back and forth considering the situation.]

     DANIEL
     What if it's a life form?

     MARKOV
     That is pure assumption.

     DANIEL
     Well, it would sure explain everything.

     CARTER
     After you collected the sample you said you experienced resistance
     trying to go back through the Gate?

     DANIEL
     It wasn't the Gate causing the resistance, it was the life form
     trying to prevent you from leaving.

     CARTER
     And now it's perceiving us as some kind of threat.

   [Suddenly there is a crunching sound and a large crack appears in the
   front view port. They all stare at it, alarmed.]

   EXT--SIBERIAN MOUNTAINS--DAY

   INT--RUSSIAN COMPLEX--CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c, possessed by the 'water', is walking down the corridor towards
   the Stargate. O'Neill is running to catch up with him.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c...Teal'c!

   [He runs up to him and grabs him from behind and they fall to the
   floor, wrestling. They manage to stand and grab hold of each other by
   the collar.]

     O'NEILL
     Fight it! Fight it!

   [Teal'c overpowers O'Neill and throws him to the floor outside the
   Stargate room, knocking him unconscious. He closes the door on
   O'Neill.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [The crack in the viewport is increasing and Carter, Daniel and Markov
   are watching it grow, not able to do anything about it. Markov stands
   and moves over to the oxygen canisters. She hands one each to Daniel
   and Carter and takes one herself.]

     MARKOV
     It all we've got!

     CARTER
     The pressure alone will...

   [Suddenly the crack increases and the whole viewport glass shatters.
   Instead of the submarine imploding, the 'water' just stays as though
   the glass were still there. They all back against the back of the
   submarine.]

   INT--RUSSIAN GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c slowly walks up to the Gate. His face is screwed up as though
   he is fighting the aliens possessing him. He reaches the DHD and begins
   inputting the symbols for the underwater Stargate.]

   INT--SUBMARINE

   [The 'water' is still not imploding the submarine. Carter, Daniel and
   Markov are staring at it. Daniel looks at it curiously and walks over
   to the front of the sub.]

     CARTER
     Daniel?

   [Daniel puts his hand into the 'water'.]

     MARKOV

     (to Carter)
     What is he doing?
     (To Daniel)
     What are you doing?

     CARTER
     Daniel!

   [Daniel is putting his hand further into the 'water'.]

     DANIEL
     I think it just wants to understand.

     MARKOV
     What?

     DANIEL
     Us.

   [Suddenly the water seems to hold on to Daniel and pull him in. Markov
   and Carter rush over to try to stop it but the 'water' envelops them
   completely pulling them in too.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STARGATE ROOM

   [O'Neill awakens on the floor outside the Stargate room. He hears the
   sound of the DHD being activated. O'Neill stands quickly and walks
   through the door into the Gate room just as Teal'c activates the Gate.
   The Gate opens and Teal'c walks towards it. Suddenly Teal'c falls to
   the floor and 'vomits' the 'water' up as Maybourne did. O'Neill looks
   on in horror. The 'water' turns to a vapor and goes through the
   Stargate, which then deactivates. O'Neill rushes up to Teal'c, who
   appears dazed but unharmed.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     They had no wish to kill me, O'Neill. They only wished to travel
     home.

     O'NEILL
     That's good. You all right?

     O'NEILL
     I will be.

   [Suddenly all the chevrons on the Gate light up.]

     O'NEILL
     Ok, I think we should...duck!

   [They both crouch down as the Gate activates above them. The vortex
   narrowly misses them. When the Gate has opened they stand up and
   Daniel, Markov and Carter come flying through the Gate, landing hard on
   the ramp.]

     O'NEILL
     Aghh! That had to hurt!

   [O'Neill and Teal'c walk over to the others, who are slowly and
   painfully standing up, dazed.]

     O'NEILL
     Didn't you guys leave here in a submarine?

   [They all stare at him, shocked.]

     CARTER
     We err...

     DANIEL
     Last thing I remember is being pulled into the...

   [He gestures towards the Stargate, puzzled.]

     CARTER
     Not really sure what happened, sir.

   [Teal'c looks towards O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Here's a thought. We just exchanged hostages...

   [Carter, Daniel and Markov stare at him, puzzled, unaware of what has
   happened at the base.]

     O'NEILL
     It's just a thought.

   FADE OUT

   THE END
