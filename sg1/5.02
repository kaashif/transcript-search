   FADE IN

   INT--SECURE ROOM, SGC

   [Teal'c is meditating when O'Neill, Hammond and Dr McKenzie enter. He
   smiles at O'Neill.]

     TEAL'C
     It is good to see you, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     You too.

     TEAL'C
     You appear to be well.

     O'NEILL
     Well, forget appearances. The back's gone, the knee's shot, forget
     the curling. You?

     TEAL'C
     I am well again.

     O'NEILL
     So I hear. Welcome back.

     TEAL'C
     I once again pledge to you my allegiance and ask your forgiveness
     for succumbing to the will of Apophis.

     O'NEILL
     Well he did sort of have you over a barrel, you being dead and all.

     TEAL'C
     It was through the power of the sarcophagus that I was forced to
     again believe that Apophis was my god.

     O'NEILL
     Sarcophagi will do that.

     TEAL'C
     Dr McKenzie has convinced me otherwise.

     McKENZIE
     You convinced yourself Teal'c. All I did was shine a light on
     something you already knew.

     O'NEILL
     You know, just for fun...I'd love to hear you say it out loud.

     TEAL'C
     That Apophis is a false god, that the Goa'uld are nothing more than
     parasites.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, that stuff.

     TEAL'C
     I hope one day to restore your trust in me O'Neill. And to return to
     your service, General Hammond.

     O'NEILL

     (to McKenzie)
     What do you think?

   [McKenzie shrugs, leaving it to O'Neill's decision.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     After you.

   [They leave the room.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [Bra'tac waits for them as they head down the corridor.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to Teal'c)
     Hello, old friend

   .

   [He clasps Teal'c's forearm in greeting.]

     TEAL'C
     Master Bra'tac, it hasbeen too long.

     BRA'TAC
     So it has. Your friends of Earth took great pains in bringing me
     here.

   [He continues to smile as he stares at Teal'c, then prevents him from
   walking away.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to the others)
     He is deceiving you.

   [Teal'c stops smiling, then breaks away, running down the corridor. Two
   airmen try to stop him, but he shoves them aside. He rounds the corner,
   only to come face to face with Carter, Daniel and two other, armed
   airmen. Carter is armed with a zat, which she points at him.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c attempts to run back but is stopped by Bra'tac and the others.]

     TEAL'C

     (to Bra'tac)
     Sholva!

   [Bra'tac zats him and Teal'c collapses. Bra'tac kneels beside him and
   pulls up his T-shirt to reveal his stomach and his pouch. There is a
   squishing sound as Bra'tac thrusts his hand into the pouch.]

     O'NEILL

     (in disgust)
     Whoa! What are you doing?

     BRA'TAC
     If Teal'c won't hear the truth in words, he must learn of it another
     way.

   [Bra'tac withdraws Teal'c's symbiote, which squeals and writhes in his
   hand.]

     BRA'TAC
     The only way left to us.

   END OF TEASER

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC

     HAMMOND
     Master Bra'tac, before we proceed...

     BRA'TAC
     We waste time.

     HAMMOND
     Please explain to me what it is you hope to achieve by depriving
     Teal'c of his symbiote.

     BRA'TAC
     I hope to save him.

     DANIEL
     By killing him.

     BRA'TAC
     If necessary.

     O'NEILL
     See, I think we disagree on the meaning of the word 'save'.

     BRA'TAC
     You would have him remain this way, loving a false god, spitting and
     cursing?

     O'NEILL
     No.

     CARTER
     There may be other methods we haven't considered.

     BRA'TAC
     I have seen your methods. You underestimate the hold Apophis has on
     Teal'c's heart. In time, you will have little choice but to lock him
     away, for he is far too dangerous an enemy to have in your midst.
     The Rite of Malsuraan is the only way.

     DANIEL

     (translating)
     Last Rite.

     BRA'TAC
     To save Teal'c's soul, first we must take him to the very threshold
     of death. On Chulak, it is said that when a warrior is dying, the
     events that forged him wash over his mind like a great wave.

     DANIEL
     His whole life passes before his eyes, we have a similar...uh, where
     does that get us?

     BRA'TAC
     Through his fever and hallucination, he will relive his true path,
     buried beneath this lie.

     O'NEILL
     You've done this before?

     BRA'TAC
     Twice, in my 137 years.

     CARTER
     So you know it works.

     BRA'TAC
     Neither Jaffa had the strength to turn back from the precipice. But
     I am content they died free. Teal'c would ask for nothing more. I
     owe him that. Do you?

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c's symbiote is being held in a clear container, floating in a
   fluid, while many lit candles line the room. Fraiser crosses to where
   Teal'c is strapped to a bed as the others enter.]

     FRAISER
     He's in and out of consciousness. His temperature is rising, his BP
     is falling, Teal'c's immune system is failing. If we don't return
     his symbiote within the next few hours...

     BRA'TAC
     Do nothing.

     FRAISER
     I can't do that.

     O'NEILL
     Bra'tac made his case. Hammond gave the go ahead.

     FRAISER
     I see. Then I will take this up with him.

   [She starts to leave but is confronted by Bra'tac.]

     BRA'TAC
     Do you count yourself among Teal'c's friends?

     FRAISER
     Of course.

     BRA'TAC
     Then stay. When the time comes he may need your help to fight his
     way back to us.

   [Fraiser hesitates, then nods, and they both return to Teal'c's side.]

     BRA'TAC

     (to Teal'c)
     Can you hear me old friend?

   [Teal'c's eyes snap open.]

     TEAL'C
     Kel'kek mar sholva.

     BRA'TAC
     But where is your god now, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     He will come.

     O'NEILL
     I don't think so buddy. I know we've been over this a few times, but
     in case you weren't listening, I am one hundred percent s-sure...

   [He stutters to a stop and glances at Daniel and Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Ninety nine percent sure Apophis is dead.

     TEAL'C
     He has deceived you O'Neill. As I have deceived you all these years
     in coming to be in the service to the Tauri.

     O'NEILL
     Right.

     TEAL'C
     I have never left the service of my Lord Apophis and I never will.

     O'NEILL
     So all that time you were helping us out, saving the world, killing
     Goa'ulds...

     TEAL'C
     Subterfuge.

     O'NEILL
     Savvy.

     TEAL'C

     You can take my life but you can never take away my loyalty to my
     god. I die in his name.
     (Shouting)
     I die for you, My Lord!

   [Bra'tac grabs him.]

     BRA'TAC
     Enough! Do you know me Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     You are the sholva Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     There was a time I was once the First Prime and loyal servant to
     your lord Apophis. You were my apprentice.

     TEAL'C
     Kel'kak sholva!

     BRA'TAC

     (angrily)
     Remember. Remember Teal'c!

   [Teal'c has a flashback, of Bra'tac leading him and another two other
   Jaffa down a corridor.]

     TEAL'C

     (quietly)
     It was glorious.

     BRA'TAC
     For years we fought side by side in battle, in his name.

     TEAL'C
     My Lord Apophis.

   [In the flashback, Bra'tac, Teal'c and the accompanying Jaffa go to
   their knees before Apophis' throne.]

     BRA'TAC
     My Lord Apophis. Your enemy is defeated. You have won the day.

     APOPHIS
     Shal'met Bra'tac. Rise.

   [Bra'tac and the others obey. Apophis steps down from his throne to
   place a hand on Bra'tac's shoulder.]

     APOPHIS
     You have done well and will know my gratitude.

     BRA'TAC
     You do me honour.

   [They both turn to Teal'c and the other Jaffa.]

     BRA'TAC
     In displaying great skill and cunning, these three most honoured
     your name in battle.

   [Apophis approaches Teal'c, who keeps his eyes on the floor.]

     APOPHIS
     Tell me of this one.

     BRA'TAC
     His name is Teal'c, Mr Lord. My apprentice and with your blessing,
     my successor.

     APOPHIS

     (to Teal'c)
     Who was your father?

     BRA'TAC
     He is the son of...

     APOPHIS
     Let him speak. If he is to take your place as my First Prime I must
     know he has a tongue.

     TEAL'C
     My father was Ro'Nak, First Prime of Kronos, who was murdered for
     failing to win an unwinable battle. My family was exiled to Chulak.

     APOPHIS
     He failed his god.

     TEAL'C
     He did not.

     BRA'TAC
     Si'kree Teal'c!

     TEAL'C
     My lord, I speak only the truth. The battle could not have been won.

     APOPHIS
     Your father should have died trying. He was a coward.

   [Teal'c looks up at that.]

     TEAL'C
     My lord, my father was not.

   [Apophis raises his ribbon device and uses it on Teal'c, who falls to
   his knees, crying out in pain.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c is screaming in pain, before falling unconscious.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, what was that?

     BRA'TAC
     A conjured memory. The first of many.

     FRAISER
     He's obviously in a lot of pain. At least let me give him...

     BRA'TAC
     Pain is what we seek. Teal'c's path was laid down with suffering. It
     is the path he must take to return to us.

     FRAISER
     At the moment, he's unconscious.

     BRA'TAC
     All the better.

     O'NEILL
     All the better?

     BRA'TAC

     It is his unconscious mind we must reach. I know my ways are foreign
     to you, but I have known Teal'c longer than any of you have lived. I
     have walked his path. You cannot hope to understand the darkness in
     his heart as I do.
     (He looks around at the others)
     Trust in me. All of you.

     CARTER
     We do.

     DANIEL
     What ever you need.

     BRA'TAC
     For the moment, I must meditate in Kel'no'reem. This rite will take
     most of the night and I am tired from my long journey here. In the
     meantime stay with him, speak to him.

     FRAISER
     He won't be able to hear us unless...

     BRA'TAC
     Perhaps not in his mind. But in his heart. Even in silence he will
     know of your presence, but your words will force him to remember.
     Challenge him when he does, question his beliefs. Without his
     symbiote he will not resist reason so readily.

     O'NEILL
     Carter? Maybe you could show Bra'tac to the VIP room?

     CARTER
     Yes Sir.

   [She escorts Bra'tac from the room.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [Carter is leading Bra'tac down the corridor.]

     CARTER
     I hope you understand how difficult it is for us to just stand by
     while Teal'c is in such obvious agony. Especially Dr Fraiser.

     BRA'TAC
     Humans concern themselves too much with pain.

     CARTER
     Yeah, we also don't approve of torture.

     BRA'TAC
     The greater torture would be to leave him as he is. Teal'c is
     strong, stronger than I.

     CARTER
     Oh, I don't, you're the fittest hundred-and-thirty-year-old I know.

     BRA'TAC
     Perhaps, but I am nearing the end of my time. Kel'no'reem is more
     and more difficult. The symbiote I carry within will mature within
     two years. It will be my last.

     CARTER
     Why?

     BRA'TAC
     Even if I could procure another, the new symbiote would reject me.
     It is how old warriors die.

     CARTER
     Well, maybe we can find some way to help you.

     BRA'TAC
     Life for the sake of life means nothing. Neither for me nor for
     Teal'c. Do you understand?

     CARTER
     I think I do.

     BRA'TAC
     Either he will return to us as we know him, or he will not return.

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [O'Neill and Daniel are staring down at an unconscious Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     You wanna go first?

     DANIEL
     Sure.

   [After a moment, Daniel grabs a stool and places it beside Teal'c's
   bed. He sits down and for a long, awkward moment doesn't speak.]

     O'NEILL
     I'll go.

     DANIEL
     Yep.

   [They exchange places.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     So, explain this to me one more time. You honestly believe that from
     the moment you broke us out of that prison on Chulak, that you've
     been serving Apophis? Because, I got to tell you, as your best
     friend at least in this whole live world, that makes absolutely no
     sense at all. I mean, that would make you the most ineffective
     double agent in the history of double agenting.

   [Teal'c makes a sound.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [Teal'c repeats the name as he has another flashback.]

   INT--BARRACKS, CHULAK

   [Teal'c is laying on a bunk, surrounded by sleeping Jaffa, as his
   friend Va'lar approaches.]

     VA'LAR
     Teal'c? Are you all right?

     TEAL'C
     I met him. I spoke to him.

     VA'LAR
     With Apophis himself? You were granted an audience?

     TEAL'C
     As a reward for my deeds in battle.

     VA'LAR
     I don't understand, how did he reward you? When they brought you
     here, you were so weak.

     TEAL'C
     He punished me.

     VA'LAR
     Then you must have failed him in some way.

     TEAL'C
     This day I struck down one hundred of Apophis' enemies.

     VA'LAR
     You fought well Teal'c, none would deny that. But he is a god and if
     you fail him, by sparing even one enemy's life that was yours for
     the taking, he will know.

     TEAL'C
     This was not for the battle. What god would punish a son for loving
     his father?

     VA'LAR
     Your god.

     TEAL'C
     Yes but...

     VA'LAR
     Never question that again!

     JAFFA
     Quiet!

     VA'LAR

     (more quietly)
     Today you served Apophis well in battle. Serve him well again
     tomorrow and you may live to see another day.

   [He leaves and Teal'c appears to be considering his advice.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

     O'NEILL
     Va'lar. Is that what he said?

     DANIEL
     I thought he said velour.

     O'NEILL
     Velour?

     DANIEL
     Velour.

     O'NEILL
     The fabric?

     DANIEL
     That's what I heard him say.

     O'NEILL
     Why would he say that?

     DANIEL
     I don't know, why would he say Va'lar?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know.

     TEAL'C

     (hoarsely)
     Va'lar was my friend.

     DANIEL
     What?

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c attempts to rise but is prevented by the straps.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill. What is happening? Why am I restrained?

     O'NEILL
     Well, you were sort of...trying to kill everyone these past few
     weeks.

     TEAL'C
     I could never have harmed you. The Rite of Malsuraan has been
     successful. Please release me.

     O'NEILL
     Nice try, but...no.

     TEAL'C
     I am not your enemy. We are brothers. Daniel Jackson...

     DANIEL
     Tell us about Va'lar.

     TEAL'C
     I have not heard that name in years. I trained with him under
     Bra'tac. We served in the personal guard of Apophis. If you do not
     return my symbiote to me, I will die.

     DANIEL
     What happened to him?

   [There is a pause.]

     TEAL'C

     (in a stronger voice)
     He failed his god.

     O'NEILL
     His god? You mean that scum-sucking, over-dressed, boom-box voiced
     snake in the head? Latest on our long list of dead, bad guys?

     FRAISER

     (seeing the monitor)
     Colonel, his heart rate just doubled.

   [Teal'c lunges against the restraints, no longer weak.]

     TEAL'C

     (shouting)
     Ka'shak!

     O'NEILL
     That I understand.

     TEAL'C
     You think I don't know what you're doing to me.

     DANIEL
     We hope you do.

     TEAL'C
     No Jaffa can survive the Rite of Malsuraan. You are allowing Bra'tac
     to kill me! Where is he? Sholva! Where are you?

     FRAISER

     (looking at the monitor)
     BP is crashing, let's start an IV.

     TEAL'C
     Where are you sholva?! Are you afraid to face me?!

   EXT--SNOWY CLEARING, CHULAK--DAY

   [Teal'c is blindfolded and shirtless, twirling a staff weapon in the
   centre of a snow-covered clearing.]

     TEAL'C
     Where are you? Where are you? Kel'pak!

   [The tip of a staff weapon touches his back, shocking him and causing
   him to fall to one knee in pain.]

     BRA'TAC
     Were I truly your enemy, you would be dead.

   [Teal'c turns towards the sound of his voice.]

     TEAL'C
     This is pointless, I am not blind.

     BRA'TAC

     (from behind him)
     In battle, you must use all your senses.

     TEAL'C
     Once again.

     BRA'TAC

     (taking his staff weapon)
     You have died enough for one day. You begin again in the morning.

   [Teal'c removes the blindfold.]

     TEAL'C
     Without this.

     BRA'TAC
     Do you believe you can defeat the First Prime of Apophis in a joust?

     TEAL'C

     (confident)
     I am the stronger.

   [Bra'tac returns his staff weapon and they face each other in
   preparation to do battle. As they bow to each other, Bra'tac hits
   Teal'c over the head with his staff weapon. Teal'c stumbles back and
   Bra'tac swings his staff. Teal'c blocks the blows, but Bra'tac kicks
   him in the stomach and sweeps his legs out from under him with his
   staff weapon. Bra'tac points his staff at the fallen Teal'c.]

     BRA'TAC
     Shall I fire and stop this waste of time? Or will you learn?

     TEAL'C
     I was not prepared.

     BRA'TAC
     There are no second chances in battle. You have ears to hear and
     eyes to see, but you will not learn! Shall I put us both out of our
     misery?

   [He activates the staff weapon pointed at Teal'c's face.]

     Bra'tac
     The choice is mine. Who can stop me? Apophis?

     TEAL'C
     Yes.

     BRA'TAC
     So you believe our Lord Apophis is all seeing? All powerful?

     TEAL'C
     He is a god.

     BRA'TAC

     Is he? In battle Teal'c, faith will not save you. Blind faith least
     of all.
     (He kneels down and pulls Teal'c upright)
     Rely on your own strength, your own wits, or you are of no use to
     me.

   [He rises and walks away.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Daniel has now taken his place at Teal'c's bedside.]

     DANIEL
     I think the point that Jack was trying to make is that you're
     generally a very, extremely logical person and therefore your
     assertion that you never left the service of Apophis is so
     completely illogical, almost to the point of making absolutely no
     sense whatsoever...

     TEAL'C
     Do you not know the meaning of faith, Daniel Jackson?

     DANIEL
     I think I do.

     TEAL'C
     Then you should know that my faith in Apophis is beyond question.

     DANIEL
     Still, if you remember me and you remember, Jack, you must remember
     at some point questioning your faith.

     TEAL'C
     Never! Apophis is a god.

     DANIEL
     False god. Dead, false god.

     TEAL'C
     Your words cannot change the truth.

     DANIEL
     They're not my words, Teal'c, they're yours. Of course, you were
     wrong at the time because he wasn't...actually dead. But that's
     neither here not there...

     TEAL'C
     Lies!

     DANIEL
     The point is, there was a time in your life when you realised the
     Goa'uld can't all be gods. Every symbiote a Jaffa carries will take
     a human host given the chance and become a Goa'uld. How can they all
     be gods?

     TEAL'C
     Do not test my temper woman!

   [He has another flashback.]

   INT--HOUSE, CHULAK--NIGHT

   [Teal'c is sitting at a table as his wife, Drey'auc speaks.]

     DREY'AUC
     I know you honour Bra'tac.

     TEAL'C
     I said do not test my temper!

   [He bangs his fist on the table in anger.]

     DREY'AUC
     But you have no choice but to tell Apophis of his betrayal.

     TEAL'C
     Bra'tac is my master.

     DREY'AUC
     Apophis is your god.

     TEAL'C
     If I am ever to be First Prime of Apophis, I must first honour
     Bra'tac.

     DREY'AUC
     You have seen the power of Apophis. You have seen his chariots rise
     from the ground, walk through the wall of water within the Chapp'ai.

     TEAL'C
     As I have done.

     DREY'AUC
     Explain how a ball of light can leave his palm and throw a warrior
     across the square if he is not a god.

     TEAL'C

     (frustrated)
     I cannot!
     (He rises)
     Yet neither have I seen a warrior greater than Bra'tac.

     DREY'AUC
     Then you are the servant of two masters.

     TEAL'C
     What am I to do, Drey'auc?

   [She strokes his face.]

     DREY'AUC
     Come to bed.

   [They kiss.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

     DANIEL
     Woman? Did he just call me a woman?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I believe he did.

   [Carter enters.]

     CARTER
     Still unconscious.

     DANIEL
     In and out, obviously delirious.

   [Carter crosses to Fraiser.]

     CARTER
     How's Junior doing?

     FRAISER
     The symbiote is fine for now, although I don't know what we're going
     to do with it if we let Teal'c die. But, it won't be my problem.
     I'll have already resigned if we let this go that far.

     CARTER
     Janet, I know how you feel...

     FRAISER
     No. I'm a doctor, Sam. This goes against every part of me to just
     stand by and do nothing.

     CARTER
     I don't think that we're doing nothing.

     FRAISER

     (unconvinced)
     Yeah.

   [Carter returns to Teal'c's bedside.]

     CARTER
     So, is it working? Has he said anything?

     O'NEILL
     Talked about fabric, briefly.

     DANIEL
     He just called me a woman.

     O'NEILL
     So I think it's working.

     DANIEL
     Well, something's happening.

     CARTER
     Well, it looks like we're in for the whole night. We should probably
     take turns sitting with him.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, all right. I'll come back in a couple of hours. Daniel, you go
     after me. Then I think we'll all wanna be here.

   [He rises and leaves, followed by Daniel, leaving Carter to sit with
   Teal'c.]

     CARTER
     Hey Teal'c. Look, I don't know how good I'm going to be at this, but
     um...I guess the important thing is just to be there for you.

   [Teal'c suddenly opens his eyes.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter. How can you allow them to do this to me?

     CARTER
     Teal'c...

     TEAL'C
     I have no wish to die, Major Carter. You and Dr Fraiser could yet
     save me.

     CARTER
     You're not going to die.

     TEAL'C
     I am being murdered as we speak.

     CARTER
     We're helping you.

     TEAL'C
     Help me escape. Please.

     CARTER
     Oh God. Teal'c, we want you to remember.

     TEAL'C
     Do you believe in a god, Major Carter?

     CARTER
     This isn't about me.

     TEAL'C
     How would it be if you were punished for loving your god as I love
     mine?

     CARTER
     It's not the same.

     TEAL'C
     I can't but help what I believe.

     CARTER
     You believe in freedom, Teal'c. You believe in justice, in
     protecting people from false gods. You despise everything Apophis
     was.

     TEAL'C

     (growing weaker)
     He failed his god...he...failed...his god...

     CARTER
     Teal'c?

   [He doesn't answer.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, PYRAMID SHIP

   [The Jaffa, Va'lar, hurries up to Teal'c.]

     VA'LAR
     Teal'c!

     TEAL'C
     Why have you returned from the planet?

     VA'LAR
     I need to speak with you.

     TEAL'C
     Speak now, Apophis has summoned me.

     VA'LAR
     Alone. Please.

   [They step into an alcove, away from the other Jaffa.]

     VA'LAR
     The battle did not go well. Ra's warriors were in far greater
     numbers than we believed.

     TEAL'C
     You were given a battalion.

     VA'LAR
     Ra sent his gliders down upon us. We were flanked and bombarded from
     the sky, there was no choice but to retreat.

     TEAL'C
     Shan'krev'lar.

     VA'LAR
     It was the only way to save my men.

     TEAL'C
     And yourself.

     VA'LAR
     No! I intend to return and with greater numbers I will drive Ra's
     warriors from their foothold. Please, tell him I am no coward and if
     given the chance I will yet prevail. I swear it.

     TEAL'C
     Go to our sleeping quarters. Wait for me there.

     VA'LAR
     Teal'c. There were no profit to merely fight and die.

     TEAL'C
     You may yet wish you had.

   [He walks off.]

   INT--BRIDGE, PYRAMID SHIP

   [Bra'tac enters the bridge. Apophis is looking down at the planet
   below.]

     BRA'TAC

     (going to one knee)
     My Lord, we are at your service.

     APOPHIS
     Who did you entrust with this campaign?

     BRA'TAC
     Va'lar of Chulak. A promising warrior.

     APOPHIS
     Yet he returned in disgrace.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps not in disgrace, my Lord. But as part of a cunning strategy.
     To withdraw, only to return in greater numbers to crush an
     overconfident enemy. Va'lar himself would like to lead the second
     wave.

     APOPHIS
     Does he?

     BRA'TAC
     My Lord, allow me to...

   [Apophis holds up his hand, silencing him.]

     APOPHIS
     You would have done the same in his place, would you Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     No my Lord.

     APOPHIS
     You would have held your ground in the name of your god?

     TEAL'C
     Yes, my Lord.

     APOPHIS
     Then return with him to his place of shame, and kill him.

     TEAL'C
     Yes, my Lord.

   [He rises and leaves.]

   INT--BARRACKS, PYRAMID SHIP

   [Va'lar is contemplating his fate as Teal'c enters the room to carry
   out Apophis' orders.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, PYRAMID SHIP

   [A bound and unarmed Va'lar precedes Teal'c down the corridor. They
   enter a ring room, surrounded by a dozen Jaffa.]

     TEAL'C
     Jaffa! Kek'shal kree, sholva.

   [The other Jaffa bow their heads. Teal'c shoves Va'lar into the ring
   area and steps in beside him. They are transported down to the planet.]

     VA'LAR
     You may take solace for what you are about to do, Teal'c. I should
     have died on this battlefield.

   [He goes to his knees before Teal'c.]

     VA'LAR
     Please tell Apophis I died well, honouring his name.

   [Teal'c points his staff weapon at Va'lar's throat.]

     TEAL'C
     Rise.

   [Va'lar exhales heavily, then does so. Teal'c produces a small knife
   used for the removal of symbiotes. He uses it to cut Va'lar's bonds.]

     TEAL'C
     There is a small village, two or three days walk south of the city.
     You may find shelter. Do not allow yourself to be captured by either
     side.

     VA'LAR
     Teal'c, you cannot do this. Even for me, he will know.

     TEAL'C
     We shall see.

     VA'LAR
     I am more willing to face my punishment than to live knowing what
     Apophis would do to you. For your sake, you must.

     TEAL'C
     Go now and never show your face again.

     VA'LAR

     (whispering)
     He is a god, Teal'c, he will know that you have spared me.

     TEAL'C
     We shall see. Go.

   [Va'lar finally leaves, running away. Teal'c watches him leave, then
   sees a dead Jaffa lying on the ground. He goes to the body and starts
   to pull off the Jaffa's uniform.]

   INT--RING ROOM, PYRAMID SHIP

   [Teal'c transports back to the ship. Apophis and two serpent guards are
   awaiting him. He falls to his knees.]

     TEAL'C
     It is done.

   [He holds up a weakly squirming symbiote, the one he took from the dead
   Jaffa.]

     APOPHIS
     You have promise Teal'c.

   [He turns and leaves with his guards.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Carter dabs at Teal'c's face with a cloth. Hammond watches from the
   observation room above. O'Neill enters and takes a seat beside the
   General.]

     HAMMOND
     You didn't stay away long.

     O'NEILL
     You should talk. You can go in there you know.

     HAMMOND
     I know.

     O'NEILL
     General, if Teal'c were here, he'd say you made the right decision.

     HAMMOND
     If he were here.

     O'NEILL
     He'll be back.

     HAMMOND

     If not, Teal'c will be sent to a high security facility and placed
     in solitary confinement. When his symbiote matures in four or fives
     years...
     (He pauses)
     I won't do that to him, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     No Sir. Of course not.

   INT--HOUSE, CHULAK--NIGHT

   [Teal'c wakes from a nightmare with a gasp and gets out of bed. He
   splashes water over his face.]

     DREY'AUC
     What is wrong, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Three days ago I led a battalion, to retake a planet that had been
     occupied by Ra's army. Apophis ordered me to burn a village of Ra's
     followers to the ground.

     DREY'AUC
     You did this?

     TEAL'C
     Yes.

     DREY'AUC
     Then sleep well in the knowledge you have served Apophis.

     TEAL'C
     I cannot close my eyes without seeing the innocent faces of the
     women and children who lived there. A Jaffa lived there also, a
     warrior named Va'lar.

     DREY'AUC

     (shaking her head)
     No.

     TEAL'C
     I banished him to that village to save his life, only to take it
     away for fear that Apophis would learn my secret. I put my own life
     before that of an entire village and that of a dear friend.

     DREY'AUC
     No, you had no choice.

     TEAL'C
     I did have a choice.

   [Drey'auc gets out of bed.]

     DREY'AUC
     A son...will soon be born to us Teal'c. You must ensure that he has
     a father. Our son will be born into a real home, a gift from Apophis
     himself. It is the best life we can hope for.

     TEAL'C
     Then why am I so ashamed?

   [Drey'auc comforts him.]

   EXT--SNOWY CLEARING, CHULAK--DAY

   [Bra'tac is standing in the centre of the clearing, practising his
   skills with a staff weapon. Teal'c runs up to him, clearly excited.]

     TEAL'C

     (grinning)
     Te'ma'tey! Master Bra'tac. Te'ma tey.

     BRA'TAC
     Apophis has made you his First Prime.

     TEAL'C

     (smile fading)
     You are not pleased.

     BRA'TAC

     (sharply)
     No.

     TEAL'C
     There is no greater honour among Jaffa than to become First Prime to
     one's god...

     BRA'TAC
     Ahh! You know as well as I what the Goa'uld truly are. We pretend,
     men like you and I, so we may advance in rank and privilege, but do
     not pretend to me now. You know the truth. Can you look me in the
     face and say otherwise?

     TEAL'C
     My entire life you have prepared me for this day. Why?

     BRA'TAC
     I saw the spark of doubt in you and the wisdom to keep that doubt
     unto yourself. I saw you play the game with those who would play
     god.

     TEAL'C
     If I do not believe in him, how can I serve?

     BRA'TAC
     Because there is no other choice but to serve. The Goa'uld are
     powerful. They've seen to it that we cannot live without them and so
     it may be for all time. But neither can they live without the Jaffa.
     We are they're true power.

     TEAL'C
     I do not understand.

     BRA'TAC
     As First Prime that power will be yours. When Apophis throws his
     armies into the fire you will be there to temper his sword. And in
     so doing, you may save countless lives as I have done in my time.

     TEAL'C
     And you have done all these things against his will?

     BRA'TAC

     His will can be made to bend, but not always. I have done deeds for
     which I cannot forgive even myself. As will you. Men such as you and
     I have only the comfort of those time we make a difference.
     (He places his hand over Teal'c's heart)
     Make a difference.

   [He walks away, leaving Teal'c standing alone in the clearing.]

   INT--PRISON, CHULAK

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac are observing a group of prisoners through the
   bars. Teal'c points out SG-1, who are among the huddled people.]

     TEAL'C
     There.

     BRA'TAC
     Those are the humans who came through the Chapp'ai. They do not
     appear to be as formidable as I have imagined.

     TEAL'C
     Their weapons are not of Goa'uld design.

     BRA'TAC
     That may be so, Teal'c, but they are only three.

     TEAL'C
     There is something more. A strength. They know the taste of freedom.

     BRA'TAC
     Your dreams of freedom will be your undoing, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps so.

     BRA'TAC
     Pray they are not chosen as hosts. That is the best fate you can
     wish for them.

   [He walks away, but Teal'c remains.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c is still strapped to the bed, eyes closed.]

     TEAL'C

     (whispering)
     What have I done?

   [The monitor starts to beep erratically, the lines indicating Teal'c's
   heart rate going red.]

     FRAISER
     He's in de-fib, get the cart.

     CARTER
     This is it.

   [O'Neill grabs a phone on the wall.]

     O'NEILL

     (into phone)
     Get Bra'tac down here.

   INT--CORRIDOR, SGC

   [Bra'tac runs down the corridor.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [A nurse wheels the jar containing the symbiote over to Teal'c's bed.]

     FRAISER
     I'm returning the symbiote.

     BRA'TAC
     Stand aside.

     FRAISER
     If I don't return it immediately...

     BRA'TAC
     Stand aside, or his suffering will be for nothing. This is the
     moment when he must choose.

     HAMMOND

     (from the observation room)
     Stand aside, Dr Fraiser.

   [Fraiser reluctantly obeys. Bra'tac approaches the bed.]

     BRA'TAC
     Choose now, Teal'c. Return to those who love freedom, or die in the
     name of a false god. Choose!

   INT--PRISON, CHULAK

   [Apophis' serpent guards form a line before the prisoners, including
   SG-1. Teal'c stands in the centre of the Jaffa.]

     TEAL'C
     Kree ho'mel, Goa'uld!

   [The Goa'uld enter the prison in order to select hosts.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

     BRA'TAC

     (shouting)
     Choose to be the warrior we know! Renounce Apophis and return to us!

     FRAISER
     It's now or never.

     BRA'TAC
     Choose!

   [Teal'c fails to respond and Bra'tac appears shocked.]

     BRA'TAC
     Very well.

   [He releases Teal'c.]

     FRAISER
     Let's move.

   INT--PRISON, CHULAK

     APOPHIS
     Kill the rest.

   [The remaining prisoners who have not been chosen start to scream and
   run towards the back of the prison. The serpent guards advance on them
   as O'Neill stands his ground.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

     FRAISER
     Symbiote's in.

   [She throws off her gloves.]

     NURSE
     No change.

     FRAISER
     We waited too long. Charge to two hundred.

     NURSE
     Charging.

   [The nurse hands Fraiser the paddles of the defibrillator.]

     FRAISER
     Clear.

   [She presses the paddles to Teal'c's chest, causing him to arch.]

   INT--PRISON, CHULAK

   [The prisoners are still screaming in fear. Teal'c walks towards the
   advancing Serpent Guards as they charge their staff
   weapons.]INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

     NURSE
     No pulse.

     FRAISER
     Make it three sixty. Give me five of eppy. Charging. Clear.

   [She uses the paddles once more.]

   INT--PRISON, CHULAK

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     I can save these people!

   [Teal'c turns and aims his staff weapon at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     Help me.
     (More quietly)
     Help me.

     TEAL'C
     Many have said that.

   [He turns and fires on the Serpent Guards, then tosses his weapon to
   O'Neill.]

     TEAL'C
     But you are the first I believe could do it.

   INT--INFIRMARY, SGC

   [Teal'c experiences a multitude of flashbacks, the sum of all the
   things he has done since he joined SG-1. His eyes snap open]

     TEAL'C
     I choose freedom.

   [He looks to the others, who all seem shocked. Bra'tac bends over him
   and stares into his eyes for a long moment, before smiling.]

     BRA'TAC
     The right has succeeded. He has returned to us.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, just out of curiosity...how do you feel about...?

     TEAL'C
     Apophis is a false god. A dead, false god.

   [The others all smile.]

     O'NEILL
     It's good enough for me. Get him out of those restraints.

   [As Fraiser starts to undo the straps, Hammond enters the room.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Fraiser)
     Thank you doctor, well done.

     FRAISER
     Yes Sir. I'm glad it worked out too.

     CARTER
     Hey Teal'c.

     TEAL'C

     Major Carter, Daniel Jackson.
     (He clasps Bra'tac's forearm)
     Te'ma'tey.

     BRA'TAC
     My friend.

     TEAL'C
     General Hammond, I once again pledge my allegiance to you and the
     people of this world. And I request permission to return to SG-1.

     HAMMOND
     Permission granted.

   FADE OUT

   THE END
