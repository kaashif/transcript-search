   EXCERPT FROM 5.12 "WORMHOLE X-TREME"

   [Martin's spaceship, filled with the rest of his crew but not him,
   takes off.]

     MARTIN

     (voiceover)
     I'm not just interested in outer space...

   EXCERPT FROM 4.11 "POINT OF NO RETURN"

   INT--MONTANA DINER

     MARTIN

     (continuing)
     ...I'm from outer space.

   EXCERPTS FROM 5.12 "WORMHOLE X-TREME"

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond and SG-1 watch as a promotional preview video for Wormhole
   X-Treme is shown. Individual shots appear of each cast member firing
   their weapon and diving forward from the star portal's ramp which bears
   a huge orange and red "X".]

     TV SHOW ANNOUNCER
     Four X-cellent heroes in an X-traordinary new sci-fi series!
     Starring Nick Marlowe as the wry Colonel Danning...

   [Marlowe as Danning fights in poorly coordinated hand-to-hand combat
   with thugs]

     DANNING

     (as the last "thug" falls)
     As a matter of fact, it DOES say Colonel on my uniform.

   [A gaudy graphic depicting the Wormhole X-Treme logo takes up the
   entire foreground of the screen.]

     TV SHOW ANNOUNCER
     Wormhole X-Treme.

   [Marlowe as Danning and a very tall alien woman exchange smoldering
   looks as the other main cast members watch in the background. Danning
   grabs the woman by the shoulders.]

     "DANNING"
     It's what I do.

   [He stands on tip-toes and kisses her.]

   [O'Neill raises his eyebrows, leaning his chin in his hand, looking
   bored.]

     HAMMOND
     He sold the idea to the studio.

     DANIEL
     He obviously got the whole thing from his knowledge of the Stargate
     program.

     O'NEILL
     Well, if the Air Force didn't want it to happen, they wouldn't have
     let it go this far.

   END EXCERPTS

   EXT--UNNAMED PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1, consisting of O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c, come through
   the Stargate.]

   [Later, O'Neill is behind cover, holding his weapon at ready.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on out.

   [A group of three-foot tall, grey furred creatures that look remarkably
   like Ewoks from Star Wars, appear.]

     FURLING
     We are the Furlings.

   [Daniel shakes a Furling's paw.]

     DANIEL
     We thought we'd never get to meet you.

   [Furlings lead SG-1 to their village. Several structures are on the
   ground, but a few are within extremely large tree trunks.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Three ha'taks emerge out of hyperspace and immediately start firing on
   the planet.]

   EXT--FURLING PLANET, DAY

   [SG-1 watches as a ha'tak moves to land on the planet. All look
   worried.]

     TEAL'C
     We led them straight here.

   EXT--SPACE

   [O'Neill fires from his F-302, destroying two death gliders.]

   INT--FURLING TREE TRUNK CAVE

   [Carter presses controls on a small tree trunk. Other Furlings
   desperately work beside her, chattering in a high pitched,
   squirrel-like language. Daniel comes running inside. Several energy
   blast weapons can be heard outside.]

     DANIEL

     (shouting)
     Sam!

     CARTER

     (shouting)
     I thought I could make it work. But the thermodynamic loop is
     feeding back to the planet's core.

   [She turns back to the Furlings and shrugs before she and Daniel are
   beamed away. The Furlings chitter to each other in alarm. One hits the
   control panel trunk in frustration.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Furling planet blows up.]

     CARTER

     (voice over)
     Well, that never happened!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, Mitchell, Daniel, Teal'c, and Vala sit around the table. All
   have scripts open in front of them.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, you gotta open big. Catch people's attention. Make them think
     the whole thing is gonna be jam packed.

     VALA
     I love jam!

   [SG-1 turns and looks at her.]

     VALA
     Oh, I get it. It's yet another playful twist on words in your
     "Earth" language.

   [She turns back to her copy of the script. Carter shudders in
   frustration and gestures to the script.]

     CARTER

     (irritated)
     I-it-it makes us look stupid!

     DANIEL
     You realize it's not actually "us".

     CARTER
     Okay, okay, it makes the "characters" look stupid. I mean, do you
     really think the best way to introduce the heroes of this story is
     to show them causing a massive catastrophe?

     MITCHELL
     That's...realistic.

     DANIEL
     I don't care.

     MITCHELL
     C'mon, it'll be fun.

     DANIEL
     You know, you say that about everything. Come to think about it, why
     am I doing this?

   [Landry enters, waving for everyone to remain seated.]

     LANDRY
     To make sure that the Air Force is being properly represented.

   [Daniel half raises his hand, his mouth starting to form a question.
   Landry waves him down.]

     LANDRY

     (continuing)
     ...and because General O'Neill has requested you, specifically.

     DANIEL

     (groaning)
     Of course he did.

     MITCHELL
     Jackson, how often do we get to give notes on a big Hollywood
     feature script?

     TEAL'C
     I believe this is intended to be a television movie.

     LANDRY

     (holding up script)
     A fictionalized, albeit slightly ridiculous, version of Stargate
     Command is an excellent cover for the real thing in the event of a
     security leak.

     CARTER
     Plausible deniability.

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry, sir, did you say "slightly" ridiculous?

   [Carter grins.]

     LANDRY

     (sternly)
     You're doing this! You have no choice. Just give the man five
     minutes. I'll get you out of this when the time comes.

   [Daniel rolls his eyes and sighs. Carter stops grinning. Landry
   reenters his office. Vala continues to flip through her copy of the
   script.]

     VALA
     Um, I've been looking at this, and there doesn't seem to be any
     mention of a sexy female alien...anywhere! I'm not even in this!

   [Carter shoots Vala a disbelieving look. Daniel casts a side long
   glance at Vala and sighs.]

     CARTER
     You know, the really unbelievable part is that anyone would consider
     spending millions of dollars on this. I mean, seriously, all these
     writers, and they couldn't come up with anything better?

     VALA
     I don't know, I've been watching a lot of television lately, and
     apart from one glaring omission, it doesn't seem to be that bad.

     MITCHELL
     Maybe we can make it better.

     DANIEL
     No, I'm with Sam on this one. I mean, who makes a movie out a series
     that only lasted three episodes?

     TEAL'C
     It allegedly performed well on DVD.

   [Martin enters the room, talking on his cell phone. SG-1 and Vala watch
   Martin and exchange a range of expressions with each other.]

     MARTIN

     (loudly into phone)
     No, I'm not using any shots from the series!...It's a movie, not a
     clip show...The budget is the budget. They are a bunch of
     pencil-pushing, bean-counting idiots!...You tell them, if they don't
     like it, I'm gonna take it somewhere else!
     (Martin nods and smiles to SG-1, then turns away and speaks low into
     the phone)
     You know not to say that last part, right?...Yeah, "movie, not clip
     show" is fine....
     (louder)
     Yeah. I've gotta go. Yeah.

   [Martin hangs up the phone and puts his briefcase on a chair.]

     MARTIN
     Cell coverage is just terrible in here. How's it going? You done?

   [Martin looks at the team hopefully. They all look at each other with
   serious expressions.]

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Well, it certainly seems to be packed full of jam!

     MARTIN

     (shaking his head)
     I knew I should've given you my first draft. The-the producer
     brought in the other writers.

     MITCHELL
     I thought you were the producer.

     MARTIN

     (indignant)
     Yeah, the real one!
     (sitting)
     Uh, look, just be honest. I-I trust you guys. That's why I'm here.
     Just...tell me what you think.

   [Teal's looks away. Daniel bites his lip and looks at his watch. Vala
   studies the script.]

     MARTIN
     C'mon! You must have some ideas. Don't be afraid. Just...pitch them
     out. We call it "spinning". No one's gonna judge you.

   [He clasps his hands in front of him and waits expectantly.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, for starters, I think you need a strong opening sequence.

     MARTIN

     (scoffing)
     Are you serious? No one does that anymore. You just throw up the
     title and get on with it.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   [The title "Stargate SG-1" is "thrown up" in front of a close up of the
   spinning Stargate. The Stargate kawooshes.]

   END OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [The corridor is darkened with a blue light tinting everything. Alarms
   sound, and klaxons blare. Mitchell, carrying a gun in each hand, moves
   surreptitiously through the corridor. Zombie SGC personnel approach
   from either end of the corridor. Mitchell fires at them with both guns.
   He crosses his arms over each other in slow motion and continues to
   fire. The door to the gate room opens behind him, and he backs into
   it.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Mitchell uses his card key to seal the gate room door. As it closes,
   Zombie Siler blocks the doorway from closing with his body. Mitchell
   shoots him. Mitchell runs and leaps over random crates stacked in the
   gate room and uses them for cover. Through the window to the control
   room, Mitchell can see Harriman approach his station, his mouth agape
   in horror.]

     MITCHELL
     Walter! Dial 447! The only way to stop this is to get the device
     back to the planet.

   [Mitchell holds up the glowing Telchak device.]

   [Through the window, Mitchell sees zombies attack Harriman as he begins
   to dial. They start gnawing on Harriman's head and arm as he screams.]

   [Mitchell pulls out his Beretta. He begins firing at the numerous
   moaning zombies entering the gate room from both doors. Still firing,
   Mitchell backs up the ramp.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell uses his hands to pantomime firing guns right and left as he
   continues his story.]

     MITCHELL
     Bam, bam!

     MARTIN
     Look, uh, no offense, but zombies have been done to death...uh, no
     pun intended. Besides, this is science fiction, not horror.

     MITCHELL
     Did I mention the Telchak device? 'Cause that's what turned them
     into zombies.

   [Martin's cell phone rings. Its ring tone is the Wormhole X-Treme theme
   song. Martin pulls it out of his coat and holds up one finger in a
   "wait" gesture.]

     MARTIN

     Oh, sorry.
     (into phone)
     Go for Marty...Oh, hey! Charlie! What's up!
     (he stands and backs away, whispering to the team)
     It's the studio.
     (turning away and speaking into the phone)
     What kind of problem?

     DANIEL

     (to Mitchell)
     Just out of curiosity, what was the rest of the team doing while
     your character was fighting the zombies?

   [The team looks at Mitchell. He averts his eyes and gives a small
   sheepish smile.]

     MARTIN
     Son of a bitch!

   [Martin slams his phone down on his folder.]

     MITCHELL
     Studio executives, huh?

     MARTIN
     What? Oh, no Charlie? He's a great guy. He's the only one I trust.

   [Martin retakes his seat at the head of the table.]

     VALA
     So, what's the problem, then?

     MARTIN
     Our lead backed out. I mean, how am I supposed to tell the story
     without my lead character?

     MITCHELL
     Easy. You just bring in a character to replace him.

   [Martin glares at Mitchell in incomprehension. Daniel and Vala give him
   an awkward look.]

     MITCHELL
     What?

   [He looks to Carter who also frowns and shakes her head slightly.]

     MARTIN
     You guys have to help me. I mean, how can I keep the main character
     in the story without actually having the actor who plays him?

     CARTER
     Well, you could have the other characters refer to him all the time.
     Maybe, get him on the phone once in a while.

   [She smiles hopefully.]

     MARTIN

     (sarcastically)
     Oh yeah, right.
     (Carter's smile falters)
     I mean something cool like uh, face-switching or body swapping.

   [Daniel grimaces while Vala laughs into her mug.]

     VALA
     As if anyone would believe that.

   [Daniel rolls his eyes and glares at her. Vala looks back at him
   innocently.]

     MARTIN
     Come on. You guys must have some real-life experiences I could draw
     on.

     CARTER

     (inspired)
     Oh! Well, there-there was that time that Colonel O'Neill was
     invisible.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter stands at one side of her lab, talking to an empty chair. While
   speaking, she rounds the work table and takes a chair next to the empty
   one.]

     CARTER
     So, essentially, what I think happened is that you were bombarded by
     the particle field being emanated by the cloaking generator. See,
     you were in the engine room standing right next to it when the
     device was turned on. That would account for the minute traces of
     radiation we've been picking up from you. But, the good news is, I
     think I've found a way to reverse the process. We have to go back to
     the mother ship and get the cloaking generator.

   [Daniel enters the lab behind Carter and leans on the door jamb. He
   overhears Carter's last few words.]

     DANIEL
     Sam, who're you talking to?

   [Carter gestures to the empty chair.]

     CARTER
     Oh, Colonel O'Neill. I was just explaining to him how we're going to
     make him visible again.

     DANIEL
     No you're not.

   [Daniel approaches and, after waving his arm over the empty chair, sits
   in it.]

     DANIEL
     Jack's in, uh, Hammond's office.

   [Carter raises her arm in frustration.]

     CARTER
     I can't believe he did that to me again!

     DANIEL
     Yeah. You know, getting the cloaking generator off that mother ship.
     That's going to be the least of our problems. Now, getting Jack to
     help, that's going to be the hard part.

     CARTER
     Oh, don't tell me.

     DANIEL
     Oh yes. He likes being invisible.

   [Carter groans.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN SECURITY CHECKPOINT, DAY

   [O'Neill's truck is stopped at the gate. The horn honks impatiently. An
   irritated SF approaches as the truck engine revs. The SF looks around
   in shock when all he can see is a dog in the driver's seat, its paw on
   the horn.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel briefs a group of scientists writing on a white board already
   covered in Ancient writing and mathematical formulas.]

     DANIEL
     And so by translating this tablet, we should be able to determine
     the most important thing in the universe.

   [The invisible O'Neill starts snoring loudly. Daniel drops his head in
   resignation. The scientists all look around. Daniel sighs.]

     DANIEL

     (gesturing around room)
     Everyone just want to...poke around? See if you can find him?

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM AND SHOWERS

   [Carter pokes her head out of a shower cubicle, clasping the rest of
   the curtain to remain covered. The water still runs behind her. She
   looks around.]

     CARTER
     Sir? Are you there?

   [There is a long pause in the apparently empty room.]

     O'NEILL
     Nope.

   [Carter closes her eyes and sighs, then shoves the curtain closed.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill, still invisible, and Teal'c walk down a corridor. The only
   thing that gives O'Neill's presence away is the coffee cup he holds.]

     TEAL'C
     You cannot remain this way, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Why not? It gives us an advantage over the Goa'uld. I can sneak
     around all I want, totally undetected. I give us the element of
     surprise. The bottom line is, I can do more for this planet
     invisible than I ever could as my own sweet salient self.

   [O'Neill stops and drinks from his coffee mug. Teal'c stops and turns
   to where he believes the invisible O'Neill stands. He stares towards
   O'Neill silently for a few moments.]

     TEAL'C

     (deadpan)
     I assume I am staring at you stoically.

     O'NEILL

     (gesturing with mug)
     Not buying it, eh?

     TEAL'C
     No. You are most transparent, O'Neill.

   [Teal'c begins walking again, O'Neill following behind.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh. I get it. Good one.

     TEAL'C
     I can see right through you.

     O'NEILL
     Don't push it.

   INT--RING ROOM, HA'TAK

   [Four Jaffa guard the ring room, which suddenly activates, but no one
   appears. The Jaffa look around, alert but confused. One by one, they
   are all rendered unconscious by an unseen O'Neill.]

   [A few moments later, the rings activate again. The rest of SG-1
   (Teal'c, Carter, and Daniel), weapons ready, appear. The three look
   around bewildered, and approach the room entrance.]

   INT--HA'TAK CORRIDOR

   [More unconscious Jaffa are scattered around the hallway as the team
   cautiously look around. The invisible O'Neill calls to them from the
   far end of the corridor.]

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     Hello?!? Hand signals. I'm waving you over.

   [Daniel grimaces, Teal'c frowns, and Carter shrugs.]

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [O'Neill, still invisible, spins around in an empty chair. On the other
   side of the work bench, Teal'c and Daniel watch the chair spin. Carter
   types on her keyboard.]

     CARTER
     Okay, I've made the necessary adjustments. All I have to do now is
     initiate the sequence.

   [The chair stops spinning.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Let's do it.

   [Carter types on her keyboard again. There is a rumble, and then all
   the power goes out, the room completely black.]

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     Oh yeah. This is better.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Martin has begun pacing the room while Carter recounted the story.
   Mitchell finishes making a paper airplane. Daniel has his head down on
   the table, resting it on his arms. Teal'c and Vala both look bored.]

     MARTIN

     (thoughtfully)
     It might feel like kind of a cheat.

     MITCHELL
     Maybe it's best just not to mention the guy at all.

     MARTIN
     Yeah. Besides, invisibility can be very powerful. You might not want
     to open that can of worms. You don't want your heroes to become too
     powerful.

     CARTER
     Well, you can always invent some negative side effects. Well, I
     mean, that's how we talked Colonel O'Neill into becoming visible
     again.

   [Martin nods and considers this. Landry enters from his office.]

     LANDRY
     Okay, that's it. SG-1, you are cleared to leave.

   [Daniel instantly sits up and puts on his glasses.]

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

   [The team stand and walk towards the staircase. Landry continues to
   walk with them.]

     MARTIN
     They can't leave! They haven't finished reading my script.

   [Landry points to the stars on his shoulder.]

     LANDRY
     That's funny, I thought it said "General" on my uniform.

     MITCHELL

     (low, to Landry)
     We owe you one, sir.

     LANDRY

     (low, chuckling)
     You mean another one.

   [The team heads down the stairwell. Landry stops at the top of the
   staircase.]

     DANIEL

     (facetiously)
     What are you talking about? I thought you said it was going to be
     "fun"?

     VALA
     Not after his zombie idea got shot down.

   [Martin joins Landry at the top of the stairwell.]

     MARTIN

     (calling down)
     So, uh where are you guys all off to?
     (to Landry)
     Someplace pretty important, huh?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The team continues down the stairs.]

     CARTER

     (to team)
     It's just a recon mission, isn't it?

     MITCHELL
     "Just" a recon mission? This is no simple recon mission. This is no
     less than my 200th trip through the gate!

     CARTER

     (weakly)
     Really? You're counting?

     MITCHELL
     You bet.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The team enters the gate room. They have changed and are now kitted
   for an offworld mission. The Stargate is dialing.]

     TEAL'C
     I have been reflecting while changing into our gear. I believe this
     is far from your 200th mission, Colonel Mitchell.

     MITCHELL
     I didn't say "200th mission", I said "200th trip through the gate".
     That's counting offworld gates, back and forth, pretty much any time
     I crossed the event horizon. Yeah, this is gonna be huge. The big
     2-0-0.

   [The Stargate powers down and shuts off. The team look at each other
   and then back to the control room. The Stargate technician there shrugs
   as staff scurry around. The team looks up to the briefing room window.
   Martin looks down at them and shrugs, gesturing for them to rejoin them
   in the briefing room.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Carter)
     Fix it.

     DANIEL
     Quickly.

     CARTER
     I'm on it.

   [Carter hurries out of the gate room.]

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Replicators attack SG-1 (Daniel, Carter, Mitchell and Teal'c) as they
   run across a grassy field, firing their P-90s. Mitchell fires the
   Ancient weapon O'Neill devised to destroy Replicators. The planet's
   atmosphere has a bluish tinge.]

     CARTER

     (while running)
     We've gotta go! We've got ten seconds before the time dilation field
     is activated. If we don't make it through the gate, we'll be stuck
     here forever.

   [Replicators pour out of the woods, blocking the team's retreat that
   way. SG-1 reaches the edge of a cliff and look down. Several al'kesh
   and cargo ships have landed in the valley around the Stargate. Jaffa
   troops swarm out of the ships.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, this could be a problem.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 exits the active wormhole and walks down the ramp, already
   unbuckling their gear.]

     MITCHELL
     Wow, that was close, huh?

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah.

     DANIEL

     (voiceover)
     Are you serious?

     MARTIN

     (voiceover)
     What?

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell sits at the table. Daniel leans against the table next to
   Mitchell, Teal'c beside him. Vala stands nearby. Martin stands near the
   window.]

     DANIEL
     How-how did we escape?

     VALA
     They.

     DANIEL
     Fine, they, they, they. How did "they" escape?

     MARTIN
     Isn't it obvious?

     MITCHELL
     Even if the valley wasn't filled with Jaffa, we could never have
     made it to the gate and dialed out in under...ten seconds.

     MARTIN
     Good. See, that's why we're here. So, whaddya think? Thirty seconds?

   [The others just stare at Martin, incredulous.]

     MARTIN
     May-maybe not such a round number. How about...thirty-eight!

   [Martin makes a note. Mitchell buries his head in his arms and rests at
   the table.]

     DANIEL
     What difference does it make? I mean, it's not like you're going to
     have an actual "ticking clock" on the screen.

     MARTIN
     That's brilliant!

   [Daniel and Teal'c look back in disbelief.]

     DANIEL
     That's ridiculous.

     MARTIN

     (nodding)
     Trust me, jeopardy plus ticking clock is box office. It's the E
     equals M C squared of the entertainment world. Ask any executive.

     VALA
     Except, I think you've replaced "jeopardy" with "certain death."

     MARTIN

     (scoffing)
     Oh come on. You guys have escaped situations more dire than this
     before.

   [Mitchell sits up.]

     MITCHELL

     (to Daniel)
     He has a point.

     DANIEL
     So show the actual escape!

     MARTIN
     Oh, no-no-no. You can't give away too much, too early. It'll step on
     the ending.

   [Daniel looks around, incredulous, as Teal'c sighs.]

     MITCHELL
     Maybe if my character doesn't say: "This is a problem." He could say
     something like: "This should be easy."

     MARTIN
     How many times do I have to tell you? It's not you. Colonel Danning
     is based on Colonel O'Neill.

   [Mitchell folds his arms and looks irked.]

   [Carter enters from the stairwell. Mitchell spins around to face her.]

     MITCHELL

     (whispering to Carter)
     Please tell me you have the gate working again.

     CARTER
     We're running another diagnostic, but right now we're stumped. The
     power's getting through to the capacitors, but for some reason the
     charge isn't holding. That's causing the control crystal to send
     feedback into the interface and reset the programming code of the
     base computer's dialing protocol.

   [Martin stares at Carter with interest as she speaks.]

     MARTIN
     Whoa! That was awesome! Say that again.

   [Carter blinks at him, taken aback.]

     CARTER

     (annoyed)
     No!

     MARTIN

     (disappointed)
     Oh. Uh, ev-everybody, take five. I've got to get that down before I
     forget it. "The power getting to the 'flux capacitor' but feedback
     is not feeding back into the 'feedback face'." This is gold!

   [Martin moves to take notes. Carter gestures that she's heading back
   down. Daniel shakes his head and moves to get more coffee. Vala, seeing
   if anyone else notices, starts sidling over to Martin and taps him on
   the shoulder.]

     VALA

     (whispering)
     Hey. Forget about the techno-talk. No one's really interested in it.

   [She smiles and nods.]

     MARTIN
     You're an alien, right?

     VALA

     (still speaking low and grinning)
     Exactly! And I know just what this movie needs!

     MARTIN
     So how would you know what sci-fi fans from Earth would be
     interested in?

     VALA

     (with piercing look)
     Aren't you also an alien?

     MARTIN
     Yeah...but I've been here...quite a while.

     VALA
     Right. Look, I think I know a good story when I hear one. Don't you
     want this movie to appeal to a broad range of people?

     MARTIN
     From Earth.

     VALA
     I have all kinds of fabulous adventures, none of which have been
     classified by the Air Force.

   [Vala nods in emphasis. Martin looks at her with renewed interest.]

     MARTIN
     Okay, shoot. Give me your best one.

     VALA
     Right. I was in a stolen cargo ship on my way...

   EXT--FOREST PLANET, DAY

   [Cargo ship crashes through the trees.]

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     ...home when a solar flare from a nearby star wreaked havoc on my
     navigation system, and I forced to...

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Martin continues to look intrigued.]

     VALA
     ...crash land on the nearest planet. In a bizarre twist of fate,

   EXT--FORESTED PLANET, DAY

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     ...I crashed right on top of the Goa'uld who ruled that planet.
     Which was fortunate because my ship was too badly damaged to repair,
     and I needed help.

   [Vala looks down and kicks the boots of the Goa'uld crushed under the
   tel'tak. She bites her finger innocently. She wears one of her old
   black leather outfits and her hair is in twin ponytails. She looks up
   and sees a group of Munchkins walking towards her from a path lined on
   either side by yellow flowers. They wave.]

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     The local villagers were very grateful.

   INT--TENT

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     They introduced me to a lovely...fair-haired...Tok'ra who had been
     hiding out on the planet. She told me the legend of a powerful
     ascended being who supposedly lived in some...distant, far-off
     mountains, through a...treacherous forest...

   [Two female Munchkins fawn over Vala and brush her hair, which remain
   tied in twin ponytails. She sits avidly listening with the other
   villagers as they surround a long-haired Carter, dressed in white robes
   and looking very ethereal, like Glenda the Good Witch.]

     MARTIN

     (voiceover, interrupting)
     Look, I don't have all day.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     MARTIN

     (continuing)
     ...Cut to the chase.

     VALA
     All right. I met up with a number of my friends along the way, and
     after a dangerous and eventful journey, we finally come face to face
     with the ascended being.

   INT--WIZARD OF OZ'S, ER, "ASCENDED BEING'S" CHAMBER

   [The room is lit up in a greenish glow, reminiscent of the color of the
   city of Oz. In the center of the chamber is a large column of smoke,
   through which appears a very large talking head of Landry, just like
   the Wizard of Oz.]

     WIZARD LANDRY
     What can I do for you?

     DOROTHY VALA

     Well, at first, I thought I just wanted to go home, but now I've
     decided I'd quite like to be a part of something...a regular part,
     if you catch my drift.
     (she grins)
     Oh, and, uh, these guys have their own issues. Boys?

   [Vala turns around. Behind her are Mitchell as the Scarecrow, holding a
   coffee mug and looking curious. Next to him is Daniel as the Cowardly
   Lion, drinking from a coffee mug and looking bored. Beside him is Tin
   Woodsman Teal'c, who looks blank and stiff, and carries a silver staff
   weapon, the Apophis symbol on his funnel hat.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell, Daniel, and Teal'c are standing at the far end of the room
   in the exact same order as their Oz counterparts, holding coffee mugs
   and watching Martin and Vala.]

     MARTIN

     (dryly)
     That's The Wizard of Oz.

     VALA

     (disappointed)
     Oh. You've seen that one.

     MARTIN

     (still flat toned)
     Uh. Yeah. Oh, that's my phone.

   [He picks up the quiet phone.]

     MARTIN

     (into phone)
     Martin Lloyd.

   [Vala turns back to the others with a grin and chuckle.]

     VALA
     I didn't hear it ring.

     MARTIN
     It's on...vibrate.

   [Martin, still holding the phone to his ear, quickly escapes from
   Vala.]

     MARTIN

     (pretending to talk into phone)
     Uh, Yes. Go ahead.

     VALA

     (chasing after him)
     I can sing!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Mitchell wanders down the stairwell. Carter moves from one control
   panel to another station.]

     MITCHELL
     So, how's it going?

     CARTER
     Not well.

     MITCHELL
     Samantha, 200 is waiting.

     CARTER

     (shrugging)
     Right now, I'm just hoping we haven't done something to permanently
     damage the gate.

   [Carter sits next to Harriman.]

     MITCHELL
     Now, how can something work perfectly fine for ten years, then all
     of a sudden, it doesn't work anymore?

     CARTER

     I don't know.
     (to Harriman)
     Okay, try it now.

   [Harriman nods and starts dialing the Stargate.]

     HARRIMAN
     Uh, we're getting some strange power readings here, Colonel.

     CARTER
     Shut it down.

     HARRIMAN
     It's not responding! The gate's drawing massive amounts of energy
     into its capacitors!

     CARTER
     Close the blast door and the iris!

   [The blast door closes, blocking view of the gate room. Sparks start to
   fly.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Lightning arcs throughout the room, overloading circuits everywhere
   and striking the blast door multiple times.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER

     I can't shut it down!
     (to Siler)
     Siler, manually cut the power!

   [Siler nods and leaves.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Siler opens one of the doors and enters. He heads to the circuit
   breaker, dodging sparks. He tries to shut off the power from the manual
   override. Instead, he is electrocuted, the shock sending him flying
   across the room with a cry where he impacts the blast door.]

     SILER
     Why does this always happen to me?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER

     (to Landry)
     Sir, we have to evacuate the base!

   [Landry picks up a phone.]

     LANDRY

     (into intercom)
     This is General Landry. I'm declaring a code red emergency. All
     personnel evacuate the base immediately.

   [Landry hangs up the phone. Carter approaches. Other personnel start to
   leave.]

     CARTER
     Sir, the capacitors are overloading. We have to get out of here now.

     LANDRY
     Hurry.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   [Cheyenne Mountain blows up.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     MARTIN

     (excited)
     And that is the end of Act Two!

   [SG-1 and Vala sit around the table and stare at the standing Martin in
   disbelief.]

     DANIEL
     The mountain...blows up?

     MARTIN

     (sitting)
     No possible hope for survival! Cool huh? I just wrote it based on
     what's going on with the gate. I love it when art imitates life.

     VALA

     (polite grin)
     Huh.

     MITCHELL

     (looking at script)
     Hang on. We're alive in the next scene.

     MARTIN
     Oh, I just haven't fixed that part yet. I'm thinking I can back-sell
     it and say you were beamed out at the last second.

     DANIEL
     "Beamed out?"

     MARTIN
     Sure, why not?

     TEAL'C
     Is that not too convenient?

     MARTIN
     Not if you hang a lantern on it.

     DANIEL
     What's that?

     MARTIN
     It's a writer's term. Another character points out how convenient it
     is. Doctor Levant can say, "Wow, that was great timing." That way,
     the audience knows I intended for it to be convenient, and we move
     on.

     MITCHELL
     Really?

     MARTIN
     Okay. Where were we?

     TEAL'C
     Scene 24.

     MARTIN
     Oh, great! One of my favorite scenes! Go ahead.

   [Martin closes his eyes and puts his hands together in an expression of
   expectant bliss. The team looks at each other incredulously. After a
   moment, Vala clears her throat and begins to read.]

     VALA
     Um, "Interior--Bridge"...

   INT--BRIDGE (OF ODYSSEY)

   [The bridge doors slide open in the whooshing sound associated with the
   Star Trek franchise. Mitchell enters. He wears a grey jumpsuit with red
   cuffs and collar. His hair is slicked back, like Capt. James T. Kirk.]

     VALA

     (voiceover)
     "The crew mans their stations."

   [The crew mans their stations. Teal'c wears a grey jumpsuit open in the
   center down to his navel and has pointed ears, apparently a cross
   between Worf and Mr. Spock. His cuffs and collar are yellow, and he
   stands behind the captain's chair. Next to the captain's chair sits
   Carter. She is in a grey jumpsuit with blue collar and cuffs and has a
   large earpiece visible on the side of her head like Lt. Uhura. Her hair
   is as close to a beehive style as it can get with its short length.]

     UHURA CARTER
     I'm picking up a strange energy anomaly, Colonel. It appears the
     singularity is about to explode.

   [Kirk Mitchell takes the captain's chair with overly dramatic
   confidence and poses with one arm back on the armrest and the other
   leaning forward, elbow on his knee. The chair swivels.]

     SPOCK/WORF TEAL'C
     Weapons are at maximum.

   [Daniel stops looking through a small viewer attached to a console very
   reminiscent of Mr. Spock's viewer, complete with the light. Daniel
   wears a grey jumpsuit with black collar and cuffs. His hair is grayed
   at the sides. He looks back at Kirk Mitchell with a manic expression,
   his mouth curled like Dr. McCoy.]

     MCCOY DANIEL
     Damn it, Cam! Solar flare. We've got a shock wave headed straight
     for us.

   [McCoy Daniel turns back to his viewer.]

     KIRK MITCHELL
     Can you reverse the...polarity?

     UHURA CARTER

     (breathlessly)
     I'll do my best.

   [She blinks twice in a vapid manner. She keeps looking at Kirk Mitchell
   while pressing buttons on her controls. Kirk Mitchell hits the intercom
   on his armrest and it whistles just like the Enterprise intercom
   activation.]

     KIRK MITCHELL
     Engine room. Warp speed.

   INT--ENGINE ROOM

   [The engine room looks like the one from the Enterprise. Brad Wright,
   er, Scotty, er, the Chief Engineer rushes from a control panel on the
   wall to the workstation and keys the intercom.]

     KIRK MITCHELL

     (over intercom)
     Take us out of here...now.

     SCOTTY CHIEF ENGINEER

     (in Scottish accent)
     I'm giving it all I've got, Captain, but you're expecting a bloody
     miracle!

     DANIEL

     (voiceover)
     Wait! Hang on, hang on, hang on!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     MARTIN

     (opening his eyes)
     What?

     DANIEL
     Okay. One, that's Star Trek; and two, it's ridiculous.

     MARTIN

     (affronted)
     What's wrong with it?

     CARTER
     "The singularity is about to explode?"

     MARTIN

     (blissful)
     Yes.

     CARTER
     Everything about that statement is wrong.

     DANIEL

     (stammering)
     How exactly is having weapons at maximum going to help the
     situation?

     MARTIN
     The audience isn't going to know the difference. They love: "weapons
     at maximum."

   [Carter shakes her head and tries to dekink her neck in frustration.]

     MITCHELL
     Never underestimate your audience. They're generally sensitive,
     intelligent people who respond positively to quality entertainment.

   [Martin looks at him blankly.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not understand why everything in this script must inevitably
     explode.

     MARTIN
     Look, you guys may all know how things really work out there in the
     galaxy, but I know the film business. Explosions make great
     trailers. Simple fact. More explosions, better trailer. Better
     trailer, more viewers.

   [While Martin speaks, Daniel rolls his eyes and looks at Carter with an
   incredulous expression. She returns the look with one of disbelieving
   amusement.]

   [Martin's phone rings again. He picks it up and answers.]

     MARTIN

     (into phone)
     Yeah. Go for Marty...Oh, hey Nora...What?...That's ridiculous...Tell
     them to stop panicking. We're gonna sign him. Don't worry. I already
     put in a call to his manager...We'll, uh, we'll get back to
     you...Yeah...Bye.

   [While Martin has been speaking on the phone, the team roll their eyes
   and exchange trapped looks. Martin hangs up the phone and turns back to
   the team.]

     MITCHELL
     So, trouble with Nora.

     MARTIN

     No, Nora--she's great. But, uh, since Nick Marlowe is holding out,
     one of the new "junior executives" at the network has suggested we
     recast the whole movie with "younger, edgier versions" of the team.
     (chuckling)
     Can you imagine that?

   [Daniel looks lost in thought.]

   INT--SPACE SHIP

   [Young Teal'c, an adolescent boy wearing a BDU vest and camo pants, is
   pressed against the wall. Making out with him and standing in front is
   a young beautiful woman who wears a white spaghetti strap dress whose
   back is so low, the pink bra she wears shows.]

   [Young Carter, a teenage girl with long blond hair and wearing camo
   shorts and a black flak vest and tank top, and Young Mitchell, another
   handsome teen whose outfit is identical to Young Teal'c, round the
   corner. Young Teal'c and his companion turn at the noise. Young
   Mitchell instantly raises his weapon and fires at the girl, hitting her
   in the back several times. She collapses to the floor with a pained
   cry. Young Teal'c is unharmed from all the bullets.]

     YOUNG TEAL'C
     Yo, dawg, whadja do that for?

   [Young Carter leans against Young Mitchell and moves one hand up his
   chest in a possessive caress.]

     YOUNG MITCHELL
     Dude, that hot chick was so totally a Goa'uld.

     YOUNG TEAL'C
     Duh. I was still gonna tap that.

     YOUNG MITCHELL
     You don't appreciate me, do you?

   [Young Carter pulls Young Mitchell around to face her and pulls his
   head down towards her.]

     YOUNG CARTER
     I think you're so totally awesome.

   [They have a brief but passionate kiss while Young Teal'c looks on.
   After they turn back to him, Young Mitchell grins.]

     YOUNG MITCHELL
     That's what I'm talkin' about.

   [Young Teal'c pulls out a cell phone and activates it.]

     YOUNG TEAL'C

     (into phone)
     Yo, Wonderbread? You got that address figured out yet?

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Young Daniel taps combinations on the DHD in rapid succession. Young
   Vala stands beside him. Like the others, they are both attractive
   adolescents. Young Daniel wears a bandanna on his head. Both he and
   Young Vala have sunglasses perched on the top of their heads, but are
   otherwise dressed like the other team members.]

     YOUNG DANIEL

     (into cell phone)
     Chill, T! I'm like, translating as fast as I can!

   [He hangs up.]

     YOUNG VALA

     (pouting)
     I'm so sick of being treated like some sort of object to be
     worshiped! I'm a real person with real feelings!

     YOUNG DANIEL

     (moping)
     You know...I don't think Mitchell likes me any more.

     YOUNG VALA
     I'm pregnant.

   [Young Daniel looks up in shock.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, eyes closed, has her head in her hands and shakes it side to
   side negatively.]

     CARTER
     Uh-uh.

     DANIEL
     No.

     MITCHELL
     Nope.

   [Teal'c glares at Martin. Martin begins to look nervous. He grabs his
   phone and stands.]

     MARTIN
     I need a latte.

   [He begins to leave the room. Vala jumps out of her seat and begins to
   follow him.]

     VALA
     How about this one? We were in a cloaked cargo ship on a simple,
     three-hour reconnaissance mission...

   [Martin stops at the doorway and interrupts her.]

     MARTIN
     Gilligan's Island, right?

     VALA

     (disappointed)
     You got that from three-hour reconnaissance mission?

     MARTIN
     Piece of advice--if you're gonna rip something off, think of
     something a little more obscure.

     VALA
     Oh, okay...

   [She looks away, thinking quickly.]

   INT--BRIDGE, MOYA

   [The Farscape reminiscent spaceship rocks violently. Stark Mitchell,
   wearing the helmet over half his face and earth-toned clothing, shoves
   Rygel Thor aside at one of the stations. Rygel Thor is dressed in
   ornate robes and sports white bushy eyebrows and a mustache. Aeryn
   Vala, wearing tight black leather, stands next to that station and
   looks concerned by something in front of them. She tries to keep her
   balance as the ship is apparently rocked about.]

     AERYN VALA
     Call me farhbot, but they're going to have our minvoks on a platter
     if we don't...

   [She goes to another station behind her where Crichton Daniel is
   hunched down working with something. He is wearing red leather. When
   she reaches the station, Crichton Daniel stands upright and grabs her
   around the waist in an embrace. They exchange an intense passionate
   look before they both look forward again.]

     AERYN VALA
     ...starburst the draz out of here.

     CRICHTON DANIEL
     The cluster's been damaged! We're not going anywhere!

   [Carter stumbles onto the bridge. Her hair, skin tone and outfit
   resemble Chianna.]

     CHIANNA CARTER
     Oh, dren!

   [She moves next to D'Argo Teal'c, who though still retaining his
   Apophis symbol, has the long beard and mustache and costuming of the
   Luxan, Chianna Carter grabs his arm in a familiar gesture.]

     D'ARGO TEAL'C
     Hezmana!

   [Crichton Daniel and Aeryn Vala are exchanging another intense look
   when another blast rocks Aeryn Vala roughly to the side. Crichton
   Daniel grasps her more firmly by the waist and pulls her upright
   again.]

     AERYN VALA
     Frell!

   [Stark Mitchell looks up from his controls in frustration.]

     STARK MITCHELL
     Aw, son of a hazmot!

     RYGEL THOR
     Yotz!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     MARTIN
     Okay, you got me. I have no idea what that is.

   [Vala looks pleased, grinning and rubbing her hands together. Martin's
   phone rings.]

     VALA
     Hmm.

     MARTIN

     Oh, for crying out loud, what now?
     (checks the cell phone)
     Oh, give me a break!

   [He reenters the room and approaches the team. Vala tries to read the
   message over his shoulder.]

     MARTIN
     I just got a text message from the studio. The foreign distributor
     went bankrupt. They're slashing my budget.

   [Vala looks away quickly. At the table, Mitchell looks up thoughtfully
   and folds his hands.]

     CARTER
     In a text message?

     MARTIN
     This totally screws up the end of Act Three!

     MITCHELL
     What happens at the end of Act Three?

     MARTIN
     With these cuts, not much. Act Three just ends.

   INSTANT FADE TO BLACK

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel stands staring out the window into the gate room. Vala stands
   beside him, reading a Wormhole X-Treme script. Behind them, Teal'c
   stands by the table, also reading a script. Mitchell sits on the table
   beside Teal'c. Over to one side, Landry speaks to Martin.]

     VALA

     (to Daniel, pointing to part in script)
     What's so bad about this?

   [Carter walks up the staircase from the control room, Daniel and
   Mitchell notice her arrival.]

     DANIEL

     (whining)
     Any idea when we'll be able to go?

     CARTER

     Sorry.
     (to Landry)
     We're trying a full reset of the system, sir.

     VALA

     (to Carter)
     Hey.

   [Carter walks over to Vala. Landry finishes speaking to Martin and
   leaves. Daniel sighs in frustration.]

     VALA
     If you want this to be more accurate, why don't you just give him
     your mission files?

     CARTER
     They're classified.

     VALA
     So? Didn't you say that no one on your planet would believe this was
     all real anyway?

     CARTER
     Even still, do you know how many mission files there are?

     MITCHELL
     1,263. Hopefully sixty-four by the end of the day.

   [Daniel, Carter and Vala turn around to face Mitchell. Carter has a big
   smile on her face. Teal'c too looks bemused. Vala looks confused.]

     DANIEL
     Actually, it's 1,264 already.

     MITCHELL
     No, it's sixty-three. I'm pretty sure I've read all the files
     recently.

   [Daniel hides a satisfied smile.]

     CARTER
     Actually, you haven't read 30185.

   [Teal'c looks thoughtful for a moment, then smiles slightly.]

     MITCHELL
     30185? What's that?

     DANIEL
     We can't tell you.

     MITCHELL
     What do you mean, "you can't tell me?" I have the highest security
     clearance known to mankind. What-what is 30185?

   [He stands.]

     CARTER
     We were sworn to secrecy.

   [Carter looks uncomfortable. Daniel raises his eyebrows and bites his
   lip. Vala, standing between them, looks from one to the other in
   bewilderment.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, why even mention it to me if you're not going to tell me what
     it is?

     CARTER

     (wincing and shrugging)
     Sorry.

     VALA

     (to Daniel)
     Can you tell me?

     DANIEL

     (turning to her)
     Oh yeah, we can tell you.

   [Vala gasps in excitement. Daniel looks to Carter. Teal'c continues to
   observe Mitchell with bemusement.]

     CARTER
     Well, it has to do with the time that the gate sent us back to 1969.

     MITCHELL
     Well, that can't have anything to do with me, I wasn't born 'till a
     year later.

     DANIEL

     (looking at Vala)
     Actually, it was...nine months before he was born.

     MITCHELL
     What?

     CARTER
     You have to remember, it was the sixties.

   [Carter makes a face and bites her lip. Vala gapes in shock and looks
   at everyone.]

     DANIEL

     (to Mitchell)
     Come on, you have to have known that Jack's always taken an interest
     in your life.

   [Daniel leans forward expectantly. Teal'c's expression has become
   impassive.]

     MITCHELL
     Jack?...O'Neill?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Mitchell looks concerned, taking a deep breath.]

     CARTER

     (eyes sparkling)
     Remember when you were chosen for the 302 program even though you
     didn't think you should get in? How about when you were chosen for
     SG-1?

     VALA

     (laughing in shock)
     Wait, are you saying that Jack O'Neill is...

     MITCHELL
     ...my daddy?

     DANIEL
     All starting to make sense now, isn't it?

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     Hmm.

   [Mitchell stares at all of them, then starts to smile slightly.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, I'm being punk'd, aren't I?

     CARTER

     (soberly)
     We honestly can't tell you about 30185.

   [Vala studies Daniel, who is still smiling at Mitchell. Mitchell
   continues to watch all of them carefully. Behind them, Martin hangs up
   his phone.]

     MARTIN
     I can't believe it! The whole cast heard Marlowe is holding out for
     more money, and now they're all joining in. Where do they think it
     comes from?

   [The team all appear thoughtful and exchange looks with each other.]

     MARTIN

     (sighing)
     How am I supposed to do a movie without any actors?

     MITCHELL
     Carter, correct me if I'm wrong on this, but is it not a fact of
     parallel dimension physics that each of us exists somewhere in some
     universe in whatever way, shape, or form we can imagine?

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     Any way, shape, or form we can imagine. We've seen it for ourselves.

     MITCHELL
     There you go. Use your imagination.

   EXT--EGYPT DESERT, DAY

   [The Stargate is raised from the sand with ropes.]

   INT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN MISSILE SILO

   [The Stargate is lowered into a mission silo.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Marionette puppets of Hammond and Harriman stand in the control room.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     All right, people, we created this multi-billion dollar facility
     under Cheyenne Mountain so that we can use this thing...Anyone know
     how?

   [Puppet Hammond and Puppet Harriman turn to a group of puppet
   scientists. The puppet scientists rear back slightly and look ignorant.
   Puppet Harriman turns to Puppet Hammond.]

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Uh, sir, we thought you knew.

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     I do know this--we need to put together a team, starting with the
     most beautiful, battle-ready, scientific genius I know: Captain
     Doctor Samantha Carter.

   [Puppet Hammond points to the control room door. Puppet Carter, dressed
   in Class A uniform and wearing blond shoulder length hair, stops and
   raises her hand in a salute.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     Reporting for duty, sir!

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     What can you tell us, Captain?

   [Puppet Carter approaches a computer and studies the display for a mere
   moment.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     Well, at first glance, I suspect the device creates a stable
     wormhole between superconducting rings that have been placed in
     fixed positions elsewhere in the galaxy...

   [Time passes and Puppet Carter types rapidly on the computer.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     ...converts matter into energy at the event horizon, once the
     initial vortex has subsided, of course...

   [More time passes, Puppet Carter puts one hand on her hip.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     And just because my sex organs are on the inside instead of the
     outside doesn't mean that I can't handle...

   [More time passes, and Puppet Carter is again typing rapidly on the
   keyboard.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     ...provided of course that sufficient energy has been channeled to
     the device, and that the current coordinates have been calculated.

   [Puppet Carter turns back to Puppet Hammond and smiles.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Okay. Get to it.

   [Puppet Carter nods and turns back to the computer.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Next, we need a bookworm adventurer who can say "brains" and "guts"
     in twenty-seven languages...Doctor Daniel Jackson.

   [Puppet Daniel is led into the Control Room from the other door at
   gunpoint. He has his hands raised. His hair is long and he wears
   civilian clothing, including a wind breaker and sweater and has on
   large glasses.]

     PUPPET DANIEL

     (protesting)
     Why have I been brought here? This is not a...
     (spotting the Stargate)
     Oooh. What is that?

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     The reason you're here, Doctor. This big ring was discovered in the
     sands of Egypt near Giza.

   [Puppet Daniel moves next to Puppet Hammond.]

     PUPPET DANIEL

     (talking quickly)
     Then I was right! The pyramids really were landing sites for
     interplanetary starships that enslaved primitive populations by
     posing as their gods.

   [Puppet Carter and Puppet Fraiser look on in the background.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Well...we found the ring in the sand.

   [Puppet Daniel notes the glyphs on the Stargate.]

     PUPPET DANIEL
     These symbols, they look familiar. They're like constellations,
     don't you see? Here.

   [Puppet Daniel moves to a whiteboard, picks up a marker, and starts
   drawing scribbles and gibberish.]

     PUPPET DANIEL
     If each symbol represents a specific point in space, then six of
     them would create a sort of...box. Now, if the intersection point
     between those six points would indicate a destination maybe, just
     maybe, the seventh marks the starting point.

   [Puppet Hammond's mouth drops in shock. He looks at the other puppet
   scientists, who look bewildered.]

     PUPPET DANIEL
     Is there a monitor that shows these symbols in detail?

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Over here, Doctor Jackson.

   [Puppet Harriman leads Puppet Daniel to computer. Puppet Harriman
   starts typing on the keyboard, and the monitor displays close ups of
   each glyph. When one symbol showing a pyramid with no bottom and a
   circle above it appears, Puppet Daniel notes it.]

     PUPPET DANIEL
     Wait! This one seems different.

   [Puppet Daniel badly circles the symbol on the monitor with his
   permanent marker.]

     PUPPET DANIEL
     You found the ring in Egypt. The pyramid represents Earth. This
     symbol has to be the point of origin.

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     It was under our noses the whole time!

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     I feel so stupid.

   [He hangs his head in shame.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     And now, what this team needs is a leader, someone who'll laugh in
     the face of his enemy, even when it's inappropriate...Colonel Jack
     O'Neill.

   [Puppet Hammond gestures to the stairwell. Puppet O'Neill leans against
   the railing at the bottom of the steps. He wears civilian clothes of
   light colored pants, a black t-shirt, and black leather jacket.]

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     I thought I told you I retired!

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Oh. I thought you said you were tired.

   [Puppet O'Neill considers this.]

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Well, as a matter of fact, I am a little...tired.

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     There's no time for that now. You have a mission to lead.

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Right!

   [Puppet O'Neill raises his hand with his index finger pointed upwards.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Sergeant, make it spin.

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Spin? Si-sir, it doesn't spin.

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     What? It has to spin, it's round! Spinning is so much cooler than
     not spinning. I-I'm the general, I want it to spin. Now!

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   [Puppet Harriman starts typing frantically on his keyboard. The
   Stargate starts spinning.]

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Hey, look at that.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The first chevron locks into place.]

     PUPPET HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron One is lit up.

   [Puppet SG-1, all dressed in brown field gear, wait at the bottom of
   the gate ramp.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     I wonder what we're going to find on the other side.

     PUPPET DANIEL
     Whatever it is, I'll bet it's amazing.

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Well, don't get too excited. It's just a simple recon.

     PUPPET CARTER
     Aren't you the least bit curious about what's out there?

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Well, I'm just hoping we find some new meat for the team: preferably
     something...bald, mysterious...you know, the warrior type with lots
     of, you know...muscles.

   [Puppet O'Neill flexes his arms to show off muscles to emphasize his
   point.]

     PUPPET CARTER
     Sir, the odds against any alien life forms we encounter looking
     remotely human are...astronomical.

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Yeah, well...we'll see.

   [The last chevron lights up.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     PUPPET HARRIMAN
     Chevron Seven...also lit up.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The wormhole activates with the kawoosh. Puppet SG-1's jaws drop in
   shock.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Puppet Harriman rises to join Puppet Hammond staring at the active
   Stargate in wonder.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Holy...

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill, you have a go. Godspeed.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     PUPPET O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Easy for him to say.

   [Puppet SG-1 heads up the ramp. They pause just before the event
   horizon.]

     PUPPET O'NEILL
     Okay, we're all going to do this together on three, right? Right?

   [Puppet Carter nods, and Puppet Daniel blinks.]

     PUPPET
     Okay. One...two, three.

   [Puppet SG-1 heads through the Stargate. After they step through the
   wormhole, it disengages, cutting off Puppet SG-1's marionette strings.
   The strings hang limply from the air attached to nothing.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Puppet Hammond and Puppet Harriman stare at the puppetless strings and
   become upset.]

     PUPPET HAMMOND
     Dear God in heaven.

     PUPPET HARRIMAN

     (hanging head in shame)
     I feel so stupid.

   [Puppet Hammond nods.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Puppet SG-1 exit the Stargate, then collapse in a heap...like
   marionette puppets who've had their strings cut.]

   [Puppet Teal'c approaches the Stargate. He is dressed in grey Serpent
   Guard armor, but with no helmet, and he is bald. He looks at the limp
   Puppet SG-1, then starts laughing maniacally.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     MARTIN

     (sarcastically)
     Yeah, that'll work. A whole movie made with puppets.

     MITCHELL
     Hey, I'm just saying...

   [Martin interrupts him and Mitchell looks away, frustrated.]

     MARTIN
     Maybe we can have Puppet O'Neill jump over a puppet shark on a
     one-third scale motorcycle.

     VALA

     (looking to Mitchell)
     I don't get it.

   [Mitchell shakes his head.]

     MARTIN
     Look, you don't know the business like I do. I don't have any money,
     so I have to give the actors something else.

     CARTER

     (optimistically)
     Bigger trailers?

     MARTIN
     I can't afford that, either. No, I have to give them something that
     costs me nothing, but no actor can refuse.

     MITCHELL
     And what's that?

     MARTIN
     A good ego stroking.

   [Daniel and Teal'c turn to face Martin, and the team all exchange
   looks.]

     MARTIN
     I have to make them think that I rewrote the script just for them.
     In this draft, there has to be something that makes them want to do
     this movie, even if it's for scale.

     MITCHELL

     (irritated)
     You know, we've been trying here. You're not listening.

     MARTIN

     (not listening)
     I'm talking about a twist. Something nobody's expecting.

     O'NEILL

     (opening door to the room)
     You mean something like this?

   [O'Neill, in his Dress Blues, leans in from the doorway and waves.
   Mitchell stands and Daniel and Teal'c join the others. They all stare
   at O'Neill in surprise.]

     VALA
     Wow, I don't think anyone will see that coming.

     DANIEL
     No, but there'll be spoilers.

     CARTER
     Are you kidding? It'll be in the commercial.

   EXT--CITY STREET, DAY

   [Teal'c, dressed in a long brown coat and brown fedora, strides down a
   busy sidewalk.]

     ANNOUNCER

     (voiceover)
     When it comes to fighting crime, there's only one man keepin' the
     streets safe...

   INT--OUTSIDE TEAL'C, P.I. OFFICE

   [In a hallway, there is a full frosted glass door set within a wood
   frame. Etched in black are the words "Teal'c, Private Investigations"
   with a trademark symbol identical to the Apophis brand on Teal'c's
   forehead.]

     ANNOUNCER

     (voice over)
     ...while keepin' it real.

   [A man crashes through the glass door, falling to the floor in a heap.
   P.I. Teal'c looks through the broken door at the man.]

     P.I. TEAL'C
     In-deed.

   [P.I. Teal'c strokes the brim of his fedora and smirks, then walks
   away.]

     ANNOUNCER

     (voice over)
     Teal'c P.I. Coming this fall.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Martin stands huddled by the window, Teal'c stands uncomfortably
   close.]

     MARTIN
     I love it.

   [Teal'c smiles and nods.]

     MARTIN

     (continuing)
     I'm just not sure if the network...

   [Teal'c frowns and looms closer to Martin.]

     MARTIN

     (hurriedly)
     But, I-I'll pitch it to them next week, and-and-and we'll see what
     they think...

   [Martin's phone rings.]

     MARTIN

     (relieved)
     Oh! I-I have to get that. We'll...talk later.
     (into phone)
     You got Marty.

   [He skirts around Teal'c and walks away hurriedly. The rest of the team
   is at the other side of the room talking to O'Neill.]

     MITCHELL
     So what brings you this way, sir?

     O'NEILL
     What, a guy can't just stop by from Malibu to say hi?

     CARTER
     Malibu?

     O'NEILL
     Sure. I was there on...business.

     CARTER
     Exactly, sir. You're an Air Force general with enormous
     responsibilities.

     O'NEILL
     Ostensibly, I just stopped by to see how you were doing with Marty.

   [The team look at him with skeptical expressions.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, truth be known, that, uh, lately I've been a little...what?
     How do I say it?

     CARTER
     It's okay to say that you missed us, sir.

     O'NEILL
     No, not that.

     DANIEL
     Like you have unfinished business?

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   [Daniel nods.]

     MITCHELL
     You need closure. And I have the perfect thing. We're about to go on
     a mission to commemorate my 200th trip through the gate.

     O'NEILL
     Really? 200 you say?

     CARTER
     That's...200 times he's stepped through the gate, sir, not actual
     missions.

   [She turns to Mitchell with a playful smirk.]

     O'NEILL
     To be honest, I wouldn't mind one last jaunt through the old
     orifice.

   [He points out the window to the Stargate. The team look at the
   Stargate and back to O'Neill with awkward expressions.]

     O'NEILL
     What? We call it that sometimes, don't we? Orifice?

   [Martin enters, putting his cell phone in his breast pocket.]

     MARTIN
     Stupid focus groups! They hate the ending! I have to think of
     something new.

     O'NEILL
     They could go fishing!

     MARTIN
     Fishing?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, it would be the perfect ending. I mean, after that, anything
     else would seem...pointless.

   EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY

   [Birds chirp as a fishing line is cast into the water and is reeled
   back. Carter and O'Neill sit in lawn chairs on the dock behind
   O'Neill's cabin.]

     CARTER
     This is great.

     O'NEILL
     I told you.

   [The two exchange looks as Daniel and Teal'c, carrying a cooler between
   them, arrive and set up their own lawn chairs. A fish jumps out of the
   water. Another line is cast in the water in front of O'Neill and Carter
   from off to the side.]

   [Mitchell and Vala sit off to one side in more lawn chairs with their
   own rods and reels. Both are in casual clothes and wearing fishing
   hats. Vala looks puzzled at her rod as Mitchell casts his line again. A
   cooler, tackle box, and nets are behind them.]

     MITCHELL
     Yep, it's good to be here.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     O'NEILL
     You weren't there!

     MARTIN

     (sarcastic)
     So, what's the twist? No fish? No. I need something with more
     impact, something more...moving.

   [Vala looks inspired and smacks Daniel on the arm.]

     VALA

     (to Daniel)
     Everyone loves a wedding.

   [Daniel is taken aback. Vala nods and smiles, clasping her hands
   together and up to one side.]

   EXT--PLANET, SUNSET

   [An organ plays a cross between the Wedding March and the Stargate
   theme song. Several people are seated in chairs on either side of a
   long aisle with columns. Among the guests in the front row are General
   Landry, and Sergeant Harriman, all wearing dress uniforms. Harriman is
   sniffling and pulls out a white handkerchief. Landry turns to him.]

     HARRIMAN
     Oh, it's just a summer cold, sir.

   [On the other side of the aisle sit Teal'c in a grey pinstripe suit
   with pink shirt and tie. Mitchell sits next to him in his dress
   uniform.]

     MITCHELL

     (low to Teal'c)
     Bit of a wait.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [At the front stand Daniel and O'Neill, both wearing tuxedos: Daniel
   with a black bow tie and O'Neill with a silver necktie. Each have a
   pink boutonniere pinned to their lapel. Daniel clears his throat,
   facing front. O'Neill looks around at the congregation and claps his
   hands together impatiently and sighs before turning to face the front
   again.]

     DANIEL

     (offhand)
     You know, if she doesn't show, people are going to think that...you
     and I are...

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [Daniel looks at O'Neill for a second, then turns his head back to face
   the front while straightening and exhaling slowly. O'Neill continues to
   look at Daniel, trying to catch his eye. He turns back to the front at
   the sound of someone beaming in.]

   [An Asgard holding a small display beams into the center of the gazebo.
   Off to one side, Carter and Vala also beam in. Carter wears a
   strapless, white wedding gown. She has long hair and a veil. Vala holds
   her train. She too is in a strapless gown, though hers is maroon. Both
   have bouquets of pink flowers. The congregation applauds and Vala nods
   at them as if she is the recipient of the accolades. Carter moves to
   stand beside O'Neill. They smile at each other.]

     O'NEILL
     Nice entrance.

     CARTER
     Sorry, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (admonishing)
     Carter...

     CARTER

     (correcting herself, brightly)
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you.

     ASGARD
     Shall we begin?

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter looks at O'Neill and tries not to smile. O'Neill opens his
   mouth as if to speak, but Martin interjects.]

     MARTIN

     (scoffing)
     Yeah, right, if I want to torture the audience on purpose!

   [Landry enters from the stairwell.]

     LANDRY

     The gate is back up and running.
     (to O'Neill)
     General.

     O'NEILL
     General.

   [The team hurry to leave.]

     MITCHELL

     (while walking quickly past)
     With permission.

   [The team heads quickly down the stairwell, O'Neill and Landry
   following. Martin watches them go.]

     MARTIN

     (whining)
     But...but...I still don't have my ending!

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate dials an outgoing wormhole. SG-1, Vala, and O'Neill are
   all outfitted in black BDU field gear. Landry stands next to them still
   in his regular uniform shirt and pants.]

     LANDRY
     You keep these kids out of trouble, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Here's an idea, Hank. Why don't you come along with us?

     LANDRY

     (chuckling)
     Nah, no. I-I don't...I don't know.

     O'NEILL

     (talking over him)
     No, seriously.

     LANDRY

     (reconsidering)
     Eh?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, come on. It'll be kinda like a special occasion deal.

   [Landry pauses for a moment.]

     LANDRY
     Well, what the hell?

     O'NEILL

     (pleased)
     Yeah! That's it.

     LANDRY

     (gesturing to control room)
     Hey, Walter! Come on, we're all going!

   [Harriman can be seen through the window to the control room. Martin
   stands next to him, once again on his cell phone.]

     HARRIMAN

     (gesturing)
     I don't have the right outfit!

     O'NEILL

     (insistent)
     You look fine!

   [Harriman stands and leaves the control room. When he rounds the corner
   into the gate room, he has somehow changed out of his green jumpsuit
   into black BDU field gear, complete with helmet under his arm. The
   Stargate activates with a kawoosh.]

     LANDRY

     (whispering to Harriman)
     Everything ready?

   [Harriman puts on his helmet.]

     HARRIMAN

     (whispering)
     SGs-3 through 18 are waiting, sir.

     LANDRY

     (still whispering)
     The cake?

     HARRIMAN

     (whispering)
     It's all set. Balloons, streamers, the works.

     MITCHELL
     All right, let's go check out the mysteries of P2C-106.

     O'NEILL

     (to Martin in control room)
     Hey Marty, why don't you come with us? Maybe find a little
     inspiration for the "end" of your little "movie"?

   [O'Neill makes quote mark symbols with his fingers. From the control
   room, Martin puts his hand over the speaker and looks into the gate
   room.]

     MARTIN

     (through intercom)
     Um, I can't. I just heard from the studio. The movie's been
     cancelled.

     O'NEILL

     (without feeling)
     Oh, there's some heartbreak.

     VALA

     (sympathetically)
     Aw, that's too bad.

     MARTIN

     (excitedly)
     Not for me! They decided to renew the series, instead!

   [Martin turns back to his phone call. Everyone looks uncertain how to
   respond.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Let's move out.

   [O'Neill puts on a black stocking cap, and side by side with Carter,
   Daniel, and Teal'c, enters the event horizon. Landry, Mitchell and Vala
   are only a step behind them. Last to go through is Harriman.]

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   INT--WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE

   TEN YEARS LATER

   [Raymond Gunne, Yolanda Reese, and Douglas Anders apparently still play
   Doctor Levant, Stacey Monroe, and Grell, respectively. Nick Marlowe is
   missing. Instead, the actor playing the leader is Peter DeLuise, er, a
   New Guy. The four are standing back to the cameras, looking at a forest
   set.]

     DIRECTOR
     And...cut!

   [A bell rings, and the actors drop out of their character roles and
   walk off the "Star Portal" ramp. Various crew mill around the sound
   stage, including the Director Martin Wood and Martin Lloyd.]

     NEW GUY

     (to Anders)
     Good job, Doug.
     (hands weapon prop to woman)
     Ocean, thanks.
     (generally)
     Well, that wasn't so bad!

     DIRECTOR

     (loudly)
     Okay, that's a cut, everybody, that is a wrap on the 200th episode!

   [Cast and crew applauds and give whoops of joy.]

     MARTIN
     Nice job, everybody!

   [The Director and Reese wrap one arm around each other's waist and walk
   side by side towards the back of the sound stage, Martin beside them.]

     DIRECTOR

     (to Martin)
     So, um, did you ever think a show like this would go on for 200?

     MARTIN
     Well, sure...what do you mean, "a show like this"?

   [Martin's cell phone rings. It still plays the Wormhole X-Treme theme
   song. Martin stops walking with Reese and the Director and answers.]

     MARTIN

     (into phone)
     Martin Lloyd...Yeah...Are you kidding?
     (pulling phone away)
     Hey, everybody? Guess what! The movie's back on!

   [Everyone gives loud cheers and applauds again.]

   [Later, Martin sits in a director's chair being interviewed by someone
   off-camera.]

   From here to the end of the episode, the scene switches amongst
   individual interviews in different parts of the sound stage with actors
   and Martin himself. New Guy is always in the background of any
   interview not his own.

     MARTIN

     (with false modesty)
     Wow, ten seasons, seven Saturn Awards for best, uh, cable...or
     syndication science fiction show. Who would have guessed? Um, I
     think first and foremost, it has to do, you know, with the writing.
     (chuckling and shrugging)
     I mean, obviously, uh, we don't take ourselves too seriously.

     REESE

     Oh, the writers are really great guys, all of them.
     (sighing)
     Men...you know. Yeah, it's a bit of a..."boys club."

     NEW GUY
     The real challenge was coming up with a-a good catch phrase.
     "It's...what I do." "It's what I do." That was so, you know, good.
     It defined Colonel Danning.

     REESE

     (confidentially)
     I just don't think they know what they want to do with my character.
     I probably should've taken up golf...a long time ago.
     (nods, then laughs nervously)
     Just-just kidding.

     NEW GUY
     And I needed something even better to make you forget about the guy
     that fans loved to watch for the first seven years of the show...I
     know he was here for eight, but uh, you know, a lot of people say he
     just kinda...phoned it in, uh, that last season.

     GUNNE

     (chuckling uncomfortably)
     Yeah, well, uh, that's ancient history. We don't talk about that
     around here.
     (starts talking quickly)
     The fact of the matter is, I-I don't really even know what happened
     there. You know, to me, it never felt like I was leaving the show. I
     just needed a little space, a little time, you know? I wanted to get
     back to my roots, theater. I just...so I go to New York. Did a
     little Broadway--off-off Broadway. Either way, it doesn't matter. It
     was acting, you know? Acting without having people hurling paper
     mach boulders at you all [beeping] day. It was great, you know? It
     was...I like them both! I like boulders. I'm fine with that!

     MARTIN
     This production runs like a...well-oiled machine. And sure, that
     starts from the top, but, I mean, we ALL love the show: the, uh,
     gaffers, the lighting guy, the uh, medic, uh, makeup, uh, and the
     caterers. It's like a family!

     NEW GUY
     The writers were trying to come up with a catch phrase. Um, "I can
     get behind that!" was, uh, something we-we tried for a while.

     REESE
     Anyway, I mean, I-I'd actually like to do some, uh, do some writing.

   [She pauses, biting her finger in thought.]

     REESE
     Maybe have a baby.

     NEW GUY

     (his hand makes an explosive gesture in front of his face)
     Pssh! It just hit me! "Sweet--[string of beeped obscenities]." And
     we can get away with that too, because...it's cable.

     GUNNE
     And you can't get there without the fans, right? I have to thank
     them. I've gotta thank, specifically, the ones, uh...the oh God,
     what's it called? Uh...the...savedoctorlevant.com. Have you seen
     this site? I mean, it's insane. Apparently, they get dozens of hits
     a month, whatever. I think that's a lot. But between them and the ad
     in Variety that they, that they put out, I'm pretty sure that went a
     long way towards convincing the producers to take me back, have
     me...to invite me back. It wasn't their decision, you know. They
     called, said "hey, do you want it", you know? And I was ready.

   [Gunne leans back in his chair.]

     MARTIN

     What I think really makes this show what it is, is the...chemistry
     with the, uh, cast. Yeah.
     (Martin's cell phone rings. He puts up his finger.)
     Hold on, uh. Stop the tape.

   [Martin answers his phone. The interview tape continues to record.]

     MARTIN

     (Into phone)
     Who does he think he is?...Well, you tell that ungrateful little
     [beep] bag to shove it up his [beep]...Yeah, yeah, let him try to
     get a job that pays this much.
     (hangs up)
     You weren't rolling, were..? Okay. Um, what, what was I saying? Oh,
     oh yes...
     (smiles falsely)
     ...The cast.

     NEW GUY

     (acting)
     Holy [string of beeped obscenities]!
     (dropping out of character)
     That would be, like a nineteen.

     GUNNE

     That's it? We-we good? All right.
     (to someone else off-camera)
     Can I get my [beeping] sandwich, please?

   [Gunne pulls off the interview microphone, and stands. His chair is
   labeled the generic "Actor".]

     GUNNE

     (to interviewer)
     All right. Hey, thanks, man.

   [In another part of the stage, Anders, in full "Grell" makeup speaks to
   interviewer.]

     ANDERS
     Science fiction is an existential metaphor. It allows us to tell
     stories about the human condition. Isaac Asimov once said:
     "Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to
     the blinder critics and philosophers of today, but the core of
     science fiction, its essence, has become crucial to our salvation,
     if we are to be saved at all."
