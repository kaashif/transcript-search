   INT--O'NEILL'S BATHROOM

   [A cryptic crossword has been torn from a newspaper and is taped to
   O'Neill's bathroom mirror. It has nearly all the answers filled in, but
   some remain blank. The mirror is steamed up. O'Neill wipes the steam
   off the mirror using a towel, and studies the crossword, his face
   covered in shaving foam.]

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Ummm...damn.

   [He starts to shave. A mobile phone rings. O'Neill ignores it at first,
   continuing to shave and study the crossword. He nicks himself just
   under his nose, and answers his mobile phone.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

   INT--DANIEL'S LAB

   [Daniel is sitting at his desk, pen in hand, with books piled up around
   him, and his laptop open.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, I've been translating the ancient writing on the colonnade
     SG-2 discovered on P3X-439.

     O'NEILL

     (over the phone)
     Daniel, I'll be there in half an hour.

     DANIEL
     It talks about a library of knowledge, Jack. I think the monument
     contains a repository of the ancients.

   INT--O'NEILL'S BATHROOM

     O'NEILL
     Repository you say.

     DANIEL

     (over the phone)
     Yeah, you know, that thing that grabbed your head, made you talk
     crazy, nearly killed you.

     O'NEILL
     Well, sounds like we should stay away then.

     DANIEL
     Well, considering what we know now, we should be able to find
     another way to access the information. Sam's been able to use Tok'ra
     crystals to, to find a way to transfer all kinds of different
     energies, I mean...

   [Daniel's voice fades as O'Neill takes his phone, and washes it in the
   sink, as it has shaving foam on it. Daniel's voice can be heard
   bubbling up from under the water.]

     DANIEL
     We should go there as soon as possible.

   [O'Neill lifts the phone to his ear again.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah?

     DANIEL
     So?

     O'NEILL
     I'll be there in half an hour.

     DANIEL
     Okay, bye.

     O'NEILL
     No, no, no, wait, don't hang up. I need a seven letter word.

   INT--DANIEL'S LAB

     DANIEL
     I told Sam I wouldn't help you.

   INT--O'NEILL'S BATHROOM

     O'NEILL
     Well then this will be the one thing she doesn't know. Up, down,
     charmed, blank.

   INT--DANIEL'S LAB

     DANIEL
     Strange.

   INT--O'NEILL'S BATHROOM

     O'NEILL

     (obviously unimpressed)
     N-yeah. Well, thanks anyway.

   [He lowers the phone from his ear]

     DANIEL

     (over phone)
     No, the word you're looking for--

   [O'Neill disconnects the call. He washes his razor, unsticks the
   crossword, and leaves the bathroom.]

   EXT--WASHINGTON DC STREET, DAY

   [Doctor Elizabeth Weir leaves her house. She is on a mobile phone, with
   a hands free earpiece, and in an obvious hurry. She walks to the curb,
   and into the road, where a yellow cab is pulling up.]

     WEIR

     (on phone)
     I know, I know, I couldn't get her off the phone. Well, I should be
     done by noon. Whatever it is, I'm sure it won't take long to say no.
     And then I'll be at Georgetown at 2 for my poli-sci class, and I'm
     speaking at the women's--

     MAN
     Taxi!

     WEIR

     in Washington, at 7, sorry Michelle, I gotta call you back, this
     guys gonna try and steal my cab. Sorry.
     (to man)
     Sorry, this is my cab, I called for a taxi ten minutes ago--

     MAN

     (In Russian)
     Yeah, yeah, I called and I've been waiting for half an hour. So
     forget it, okay?

     WEIR

     (Pleading, in Russian)
     I beg your pardon, I have a very important meeting.

     MAN
     As do I.

     WEIR
     I, I, I cannot be late, I'm going to the White House. I have to be
     there in 15 minutes, I'm meeting with the President.

   [The man cocks his head, in disbelief.]

     WEIR
     Of the United States. Really, I am.

     TAXI DRIVER
     Hey!

   [Dr. Weir looks in through the window.]

     TAXI DRIVER
     Is one of you going to get in or what?

   [The man starts to get in. As does the woman. Behind her, a black
   limousine pulls up, and a man in a black suit gets out and approaches
   the woman.]

     WEIR

     Wait! Can I offer you a cab fare, wherever you need to go? Please?
     (to Taxi driver)
     Can you call this man another taxi?

     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
     Excuse me, Doctor Weir.

   [The woman turns round at the mention of her name. The man gestures to
   the limousine.]

     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
     Please get in Ma'am.

   [The woman turns back round to the Russian man and her taxi.]

     WEIR

     Uh...
     (to man, In Russian)
     Grab the taxi.

   [She turns and gets in the limousine. In the limo is Vice President
   Kinsey, holding a small file. He looks serious.]

     WEIR
     Mr Vice President.

     KINSEY
     Doctor Weir.

   [Kinsey look at the file he is holding. Doctor Weir looks slightly
   suspicious.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--WASHINGTON, DAY

   [The limousine drives down Pennsylvania Avenue.]

   INT--LIMOUSINE

     WEIR
     It wasn't necessary for you to pick me up, Sir.

     KINSEY
     I was on my way from the athletic club. Besides, there are very few
     people that could properly brief you for this interview.

     WEIR
     Uh, interview? I agreed to have just a meeting--

     KINSEY

     (interrupting)
     How would you respond if I told you the Air Force is currently
     conducting top secret operations with an alien transportation device
     called the Stargate? It was discovered in the early 1900's in Giza,
     not too far from the Great Pyramids.

   [Weir initially listens with a serious expression on her face, but then
   starts to smile.]

     WEIR
     Is this a joke?

   [Kinsey takes a slip of paper from the file he is holding, and hands it
   to Weir.]

     WEIR
     What is it?

     KINSEY
     A note from the President.

   [She opens it, and reads "This is not a joke." It is signed by
   President Henry Hayes. The realisation suddenly hits her. Kinsey hands
   her the file.]

     KINSEY
     You might want to read this.

   [Weir flips open the file, and studies it intently.]

     WEIR
     Oh my God.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC ELEVATOR

   [O'Neill and an airman ride in the elevator. O'Neill continues to fill
   in the crossword. The airman looks over at the crossword, looks at
   O'Neill and shakes his head. The elevator stops at level 28, and both
   of them get out. Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are in the corridor, waiting
   for O'Neill. Daniel taps his watch as O'Neill emerges from the
   elevator. O'Neill stops and looks at them.]

     O'NEILL
     How long have you been waiting there?

     DANIEL
     You said half an hour an hour ago.

     CARTER
     General Hammond's waiting.

   [O'Neill walks towards Carter, hands her the crossword, smiles and
   walks towards the briefing room.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me.

   [Carter, Daniel and Teal'c follow. Carter looks at the completed
   crossword.]

     CARTER
     The fate of the world is hanging in the balance, and you've been
     sitting in your truck, finishing this?

     O'NEILL
     I believe it was double or nothing.

     CARTER
     Okay, 23 across, the atomic weight of boron. The answer is ten.

     O'NEILL
     Yes.

     CARTER
     You write the word fat.

   [She folds up the crossword, and hands it back to O'Neill, who snatches
   it back.]

     O'NEILL
     Your point?

   [SG-1 enter the briefing room, where SG-3 are already waiting.]

     O'NEILL
     Harper, Reynolds.

     REYNOLDS
     Jack.

   [SG's 1 and 3 stand behind their seats.]

     CARTER
     SG-3 spotted a Goa'uld reconnaissance drone while on the planet
     where they found the colonnade. Since that obviously means the
     Goa'uld were aware of its existence, SG's 3 and 5 will be providing
     back-up. If General Hammond approves the mission.

   [O'Neill seems a little distracted.]

     O'NEILL
     What mission?

   [Hammond enters the briefing room from his office.]

     HAMMOND

     Good morning, SG-1.
     (to O'Neill)
     Nice of you to join us.

     O'NEILL
     Good morning, Sir.

   [Hammond sits down, and the rest take their seats.]

     HAMMOND
     I've read Doctor Jackson's report on his translation. Given what
     happened the last time you encountered something like this, I'm
     surprised you're so willing to take on this mission.

     O'NEILL
     So am I, Sir.

     DANIEL
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Why wouldn't we want to gain access to the greatest repository of
     knowledge in the known universe, once and for all finding the lost
     city of the Ancients, and use their technology to save the entire
     galaxy from the evil oppression of the Goa'uld?

     O'NEILL
     Well, there's that.

     REYNOLDS
     From the mission file I've read, it's one of those things that whips
     up from the wall, grabs your head and rearranges your brain, right?

     DANIEL
     Sort of.

     REYNOLDS
     Sort of?

     CARTER
     It basically downloads the entire library of Ancient knowledge into
     a person's mind. That massive amount of data then slowly unspools
     into your brain, eventually taking over your consciousness
     completely.

     DANIEL
     Except it wasn't meant for a physiology as primitive as ours.

     O'NEILL
     Easy fella.

   [Daniel puts up his hand and mouths "sorry" to O'Neill.]

     HARPER
     I thought the report said you almost died last time, Sir.

   [O'Neill looks slightly surprised by that comment.]

     TEAL'C
     The Asgard removed the information from O'Neill's before he was lost
     to us.

     O'NEILL
     So, why don't we just shoot Thor a call, get him standing by as back
     up.

     CARTER
     We tried Sir, he's not responding.

     HAMMOND
     None of our alien allies have been particularly reliable of late.
     Should something happen again--

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     General, no one's saying anyone should directly interface with the
     device, we're suggesting we extract it and bring it home for study.

     HAMMOND
     The engineering team, that studied the last one of these devices you
     found determined nothing, after six months of research.

     CARTER
     We believe that that device's power source was depleted after
     Colonel O'Neill activated it.

     HAMMOND

     (to O'Neill)
     Recent intel suggests that Anubis has become a serious threat to
     dominate the rest of the Goa'uld in a very short time. We have to
     consider Earth is at risk now, more than ever. If the knowledge
     contained within this device can lead us to technologies we can use
     to defend ourselves, we must pursue it.

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     Why didn't you just say that?

     DANIEL
     Sorry.

     HAMMOND
     You have a go. And be careful people.

   [He leaves.]

   EXT--WHITE HOUSE, DAY

   INT--WHITE HOUSE

   [Kinsey opens a door, and leads Weir into a room, where several boxes
   full of files, and marked EYES ONLY and the presidential seal lie piled
   up almost as high as Weir.]

     KINSEY
     The file you read in the car is just the beginning. You might want
     to familiarise yourself with some more of this before you take the
     job.

   [He gestures to the boxes. Weir moves towards them, flipping one of the
   box lids open.]

     WEIR

     Take the job? I mean I just found out that science fiction isn't
     fiction and... I mean I've known there were secrets, big secrets,
     but this is, is... I, I don't know what's scarier, the fact that
     this is all true, or the fact that you're telling me.
     (pause)
     I can't imagine what kind of job you're offering me, Sir, but at
     this point I really don't care anymore.

     KINSEY
     I realise you haven't met the President yet. Just try and say no.

   [Weir looks back at the piles of files.]

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

   [The inner wheel spins, and a chevron locks. SG-1 and SG-3 are at the
   end of the ramp, geared up and ready to go. Hammond faces them, giving
   them a final briefing.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron 7 locked.

   [The sounds of the wormhole forming catch the attention of SG-1, who
   briefly turn around to watch.]

     HAMMOND
     SG teams 1, 3, and 5, good luck. God speed.

     O'NEILL

     Thank you Sir.
     (to the assembled personnel)
     Let's move out!

   [SG-1 walk up the ramp and through the wormhole, followed by SG 3 and
   5.]

   EXT--WORMHOLE

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-1 exit the wormhole, their weapons raised. O'Neill looks at the
   ancient structure in the distance.]

     O'NEILL
     Reynolds.

   [Reynolds turns round at the sound of his name.]

     O'NEILL
     Set up a defense perimeter as you see fit. Hold the gate 'till we
     get back.

     REYNOLDS
     You got it.

   [Reynolds directs his men.]

     O'NEILL
     SG-1, move out.

   EXT--SPACE

   [2 Al'kesh and a mothership exit hyperspace, and take up orbit above
   the planet.]

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-1 approach the colonnade. The structure looks to have once been a
   great statue, with a figure sat on a seat. His head and part of one
   shoulder have since crumbled to the ground. O'Neill sits, looking at
   his watch. Daniel is under one of the walkways, writing in his
   notebook. Teal'c stands guard, looking out over the terrain.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, we've searched this place, up and down.

     DANIEL
     I know.

     O'NEILL

     (conversationally)
     We could have Goa'uld on our collective asses any minute now.

   [Daniel pokes his head round one of the columns.]

     DANIEL

     I know.
     (pause)
     According to the text on this column it's inside.

     O'NEILL
     Inside you say.

   [He gets up and walks over to Daniel and the walkway while talking.]

     O'NEILL
     There is no "inside". There's just a whole lotta outside.

   [He waves his arm, gesturing to the scenery around them.]

     DANIEL

     (nose in notebook)
     I know.

   [Carter is pointing a scanning device at a part of the wall seemingly
   devoid of markings.]

     CARTER
     I'm getting some strange readings coming from here.

     DANIEL
     If I'm right...

   [He presses several of the markings, then moves his hand down, and
   presses some more. A repository appears on the wall Carter has been
   studying. She jumps back, as does O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Look out.

   [Daniel turns around. They look at the repository.]

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-3 and SG-5 guard the gate.]

     O'NEILL

     (over radio)
     Reynolds, come in.

     REYNOLDS
     Go ahead.

     O'NEILL

     (over radio)
     Yeah, we got something here, stand by.

     REYNOLDS
     All clear for the moment.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A squadron of death gliders leaves the mothership, and heads for the
   planet, accompanied by the Al'kesh bombers.]

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-1 are under the colonnade, studying the repository. They are very
   wary of it.]

     CARTER
     Now we just have to figure out how to get this thing out of the
     wall.

   [Daniel approaches it, cautiously. As he nears it, it grows slightly
   towards him, protruding slightly further from the wall.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn.

     CARTER
     Careful.

   [They move back again.]

     O'NEILL
     Alright, one more time, why are we doing this, why?

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-3 and 5 are still guarding the gate. Reynolds and another officer
   look at the horizon, obviously alerted to something.]

     REYNOLDS
     You hear anything, Harper?

   [Harper monitors the equipment on the MALP.]

     HARPER
     Sir, we got multiple bogeys, coming in fast.

     REYNOLDS
     Dial the gate! Send Collins and a radio signal, we have to keep that
     door open!

   [The sound of chevrons locking fills the air. Everyone jumps into
   action. Reynolds radios O'Neill.]

   EXT--NEAR COLONNADE, DAY

     REYNOLDS

     (over radio)
     SG-1, we have incoming.

   [Daniel and O'Neill look past the columns, and see death gliders
   speeding towards them, and there are several explosions on the ground.
   As they get closer, they duck behind the columns again. Carter watches
   the glider as it rushes past them.]

     O'NEILL
     Alright, lets go.

     DANIEL
     Jack, we can't just leave.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel--

     TEAL'C
     We must not let this fall into the hands of Anubis.

   [O'Neill opens his arms in frustration.]

     O'NEILL
     Fine.

   [He grabs some C4 and places it next to the repository.]

     DANIEL
     JACK!

     CARTER
     Sir, he's right, if we destroy it we lose our only chance of finding
     the location of the Lost City.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

   [Teal'c has been watching the progress of the death gliders. He alerts
   O'Neill to an oncoming Al'kesh.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh crap. Alright, then what?

   [Daniel looks at the ground for a moment, then rushes towards the
   repository. O'Neill grabs him and pushes him back against the wall.]

     O'NEILL
     No, no, no, no, no!

     DANIEL
     Jack, someone has to do it. The answer is in there.

   [He points to the repository.]

     DANIEL
     If we don't find the Lost City we're as good as dead. Let me do it!

     O'NEILL
     And who does the translating when you go Ancient?

   [Daniel and Jack exchange an exasperated look. Explosions very close by
   interrupt them. They all duck down. The Al'kesh looms large over the
   colonnade, and a bomb drops by only a few yards from SG-1's position.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting above the noise of enemy fire)
     In fact you're the one person who can't do it!

   [He shoves his baseball cap into Daniel's chest, then rushes to the
   repository. It grabs his head, and begins the download.]

     DANIEL
     JACK!

     CARTER
     Sir!

   [SG-1 watch helplessly as O'Neill is trapped by the repository. It
   finishes, letting go of O'Neill head, and retreating back into the
   wall. O'Neill falls to the ground.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

   [SG-1 rush to his side, all very concerned.]

   EXT--P3X-439, DAY

   [SG-3 and SG-5 are taking heavy fire around the gate. They are
   defending their position.]

     REYNOLDS

     (into radio)
     SG-1? Where the hell are you guys, we can't hold out for long.

   [He shoots at an incoming ship.]

   EXT--COLONNADE, DAY

   [Teal'c and Daniel help a barely conscious O'Neill from the colonnade.
   carter brings up the rear, communicating with Reynolds, and with her
   weapon raised and ready.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Colonel Reynolds, we are headed back to the gate.

   [As she gets off the radio she sets off the C4, destroying the
   repository.]

   EXT--P3X-439

   [At the gate, SG-3 and SG-5 are taking heavy fire. There is an
   explosion by the steps leading to the Stargate.]

     REYNOLDS

     (shouting above the noise.)
     Hold positions. Breise, you're with me!

   [Gliders continue to target the gate. The SGC forces fire round after
   round, while SG-1 run as fast as they can to the gate. As they run,
   Daniel looks behind them at the sound of an incoming glider.]

     DANIEL
     Take cover!

   [They hit the deck as a large explosion happens just behind them.
   Daniel gets up quickly, then rolls O'Neill onto his back. O'Neill
   regains consciousness.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, Jack you okay?

     O'NEILL

     (as if he doesn't remember what happened)
     What's going on?

   [Reynolds and another member of his team lift O'Neill up, and Reynolds
   and Teal'c help him to the gate. A member of SG-3 downs a glider with
   his bazooka. Meanwhile, an Al'kesh approaches their position. there are
   multiple explosions.</blockquote>

     REYNOLDS

     (into radio)
     General Hammond, we're coming through the gate.

   [SG-1 enters the wormhole.]

     REYNOLDS

     (to O'Neill)
     We're right behind you Sir! Go! Go!

   EXT--WORMHOLE

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

   [SG-1 exit the wormhole. Hammond is waiting for them at the bottom of
   the ramp.]

     HAMMOND
     What happened?

     O'NEILL
     Didn't quite go according to plan, Sir.

     DANIEL
     WE have to get him to the infirmary.

     O'NEILL
     I did it again.

   [They leave the gateroom, followed by SG-3 and 5, one man limping and
   being supported by his colleagues. Hammond sighs in disbelief as he
   watches them leave.]

   EXT--WHITE HOUSE, DAY

   INT--OVAL OFFICE

   [Weir handles a statue sat on the president's desk. She seems to have
   been waiting for some time, and is deep in thought. President Hayes
   enters, closing the door. She jumps at his voice.]

     HAYES
     Doctor Weir. Sorry to have kept you so late.

     WEIR
     Well, that's alright, I've been, uh, doing a little reading.

   [Hayes puts his glasses down on the desk.]

     WEIR
     Mr. President, I mean, this is truly so, outrageous, I feel
     compelled on behalf of everyone who has no idea to, that, that--

   [Hayes picks up his telephone, and speaks into it.]

     HAYES
     Megan, could you get a car ready for Doctor Weir.

   [He checks his watch.]

     HAYES
     Five minutes. Thanks.

   [He replaces the handset, and gestures to Weir, smiling.]

     HAYES
     Sit down.

   [She stands by the couch, and he goes to the decanter and glasses on
   the side behind him.]

     HAYES
     Would you like something?

     WEIR
     No, thank you.

   [Hayes pours himself a drink.]

     HAYES
     Your reaction was very similar to mine when I first found out.

   [He walks round and leans on his desk, glass in hand.]

     WEIR
     I'm sorry, five minutes Sir?

     HAYES
     The negotiation you mediated in North Africa?

     WEIR
     Yes?

   [She sits.]

     WEIR
     What does that have to do with this?

     HAYES
     Well, just that... the Stargate probably makes that seems like
     child's play.

     WEIR
     Well, frankly Sir, I have absolutely no idea what you want from me.

     HAYES
     You've brokered a dozen of the most sensitive international treaties
     in modern times. You speak god knows how many languages.

     WEIR
     Just five.

     HAYES
     Five.

   [He nods his head, pausing.]

     HAYES
     I suppose your aversion to the military will be an issue.

     WEIR
     What are we talking about, exactly.

     HAYES
     You running the Stargate program.

   [Weir frowns, mouth open.]

     WEIR
     Oh, oh...

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond enters the briefing room, where Daniel, Teal'c and Carter are
   waiting for him.]

     HAMMOND
     How the hell did this happen?

     CARTER
     It wasn't an accident, Sir.

     DANIEL
     He did it deliberately.

     TEAL'C
     In order to access the knowledge of the Ancients.

     DANIEL
     He, aahh, we figured we'd never get another shot at it.

     CARTER
     We know from experience that the Ancient knowledge will essentially
     overwrite the Colonel's brain. We're hoping that during the
     transformation process he'll become aware of the information we're
     looking for.

     HAMMOND
     And then it will overwhelm his nervous system and the colonel will--

     O'NEILL

     (walking up the stairs and interrupting)
     What? Meet my maker? Pay the piper? Reach the pearly gates? Start
     pushing up daisies here and there?

   [He stands next to Hammond, opposite SG-1.]

     HAMMOND
     You should be in the infirmary.

     O'NEILL
     Why? We all know exactly what's going to happen. In a few days I
     start speaking some strange language, a few days after that I start
     doing things beyond my control, and a few days after that... it's
     goodnight my someone, goodnight.

   [SG-1 look uncomfortable with O'Neill talking so matter-of-factly about
   his death.]

     O'NEILL
     So, with your permission, Sir, I'd like to take the weekend, get a
     few personal things together.

     CARTER
     The last time, it did take a couple of days before we noticed any
     change in the Colonel's behaviour.

     O'NEILL
     I'll be back Monday, ready to work.

     HAMMOND
     Permission granted.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Sir. Now, if you'll excuse me, my favourite television
     show starts in half an hour.

   [He leaves. SG-1 exchange glances.]

   INT--WHITE HOUSE

   [Weir and Hayes are continuing their discussion.]

     HAYES
     We've already done the initial review. We've decided to suspend
     current operations until a new government division can be
     established.

   [He sits next to her on the couch.]

     HAYES
     There's no question the Stargate is a dangerous thing. Given what we
     know is going on out there, it's something we cannot ignore.

     WEIR
     No, obviously not. I don't want this to sound like a terribly
     self-centred question--

     HAYES
     Why you?

     WEIR
     Why me?

     HAYES
     What do you think?

     WEIR
     Well, I'm betting other world leaders are pressuring you for
     control.

   [Hayes smiles widely.]

     HAYES
     See, I knew you were a quick study.

     WEIR
     And I can advise you there. But, I am not qualified to negotiate
     with aliens.

     HAYES
     No one is, Doctor. Not you, not me. But someone has to do it. The
     fact is, we can't keep this thing a secret forever.

     WEIR
     And you want to put a friendly face on this thing when it goes
     public. Someone a little less threatening than a US military
     general.

     HAYES
     People will panic. It's going to take anything and everything we
     have to keep our civilisation from turning upside down.

   [He gets up and goes towards the door.]

     HAYES
     But make no mistake, you're not just a figurehead for the sake of
     publicity. I chose you for a damn good reason.

   [He places his hand on the doorknob. Weir stands.]

     WEIR
     I take it my five minutes are up.

     HAYES
     Actually, it was seven.

   [He smiles and opens the door. She collects her briefcase.]

     HAYES
     Don't worry, this is just the beginning.

   [She moves to stand opposite him in the doorway.]

     WEIR
     What if I say no, Sir.

     HAYES
     Never going to happen.

   [She nods, and Hayes moves his attenion to the lady standing in the
   outer office.]

     HAYES
     Bonnie! Come on in here.

   [He rubs Weir's shoulder.]

     HAYES

     (to Weir)
     Thank you.

   [She leaves as Bonnie enters.]

     HAYES
     Great seeing you again.

   [She nods as he shakes her hand, closing the door. Weir is left in the
   outer office, where Kinsey sits waiting for her.]

     KINSEY
     So, things aren't quote as simple as they seem.

     WEIR
     Boy, they never seemed simple, Sir.

     KINSEY
     Be careful who you trust, Doctor.

     WEIR
     Does that include you, Sir?

     KINSEY
     He may be the President, but I am the one person on this fair planet
     you want on your side, and the one person you don't want to cross.

   [He leaves, giving her much food for thought.]

   EXT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE

   [Carter knocks on the front door. After a short pause, O'Neill
   answers.]

     CARTER
     Hi, Sir.

   [O'Neill gives a sideways look, seeing if anyone else is there.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

   [Carter looks at O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     Did I wake you?

     O'NEILL
     Sorta.

     CARTER
     I couldn't sleep at all last night.

     O'NEILL
     Shoulda called.

     CARTER
     I didn't wan to bother you, I...

   [O'Neill nods, then gestures for her to come in.]

     O'NEILL
     Um...

   [She comes in.]

     O'NEILL
     I was just looking at the sky.

   [He closes the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Trying to figure out how many stars we'd actually been to.

     CARTER
     Actually... only a few of the stars visible from Earth have
     Stargates on them, so...

     O'NEILL
     I knew that. Hammond send you by, check up on me?

     CARTER
     No. It's funny really, I, um, I was out driving... you know, in my
     car, and I, um, I drove here.

   [She attempts to laugh. There is an awkward pause.]

     CARTER

     (laughing awkwardly)
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Funny.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     There's coffee around here.

   [He goes to the kitchen, and Carter moves towards the living room.]

     O'NEILL

     (from kitchen)
     Maybe not. Do you want a beer?

     CARTER
     Sure, why not.

   [Carter goes into the living room and looks at various family pictures
   on the wall. She picks one up of Charlie as a baby, then puts it back
   as O'Neill returns with the beer.]

     O'NEILL
     Wanna glass? I can wash one.

     CARTER
     No, I'm fine, thank you Sir.

   [She takes the bottle. She points to a picture of O'Neill, Sara and
   Charlie.]

     CARTER
     So, do you ever talk to her?

     O'NEILL
     Can we not talk about that?

     CARTER

     Sorry.
     (pause)
     How you feeling?

     O'NEILL
     Can we not talk about that either?

     CARTER
     Okay.

   [O'Neill sits on the couch, and Carter stands next to him.]

     CARTER
     What do you want to talk about?

   [He looks at her, not wanting to talk about anything.]

     CARTER
     You want to be alone.

   [She puts her beer on the table.]

     CARTER
     This was a bad...I should go.

     O'NEILL
     Finish your beer. And then you have to wait at least an hour before
     you drive.

   [He flicks his beer bottle top into the fireplace opposite. She sits
   down.]

     CARTER
     Sir...

   [There is a long pause.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     I should have done it.

     O'NEILL
     What? Stick your head in that thing?

   [She nods.]

     O'NEILL
     Are you nuts? Carter, you're one of this country's natural
     resources, if not national treasures. It couldn't have gone down any
     other way.

   [They look at each other.]

     O'NEILL
     I just...hope it's worth it.

   [He drinks his beer.]

     CARTER
     Even if we do find the Lost City, even if we get there and find
     exactly what we're looking for to defend the planet--

     O'NEILL
     That...would be worth it.

   [Carter shakes her head slightly. There is a jovial knock at the front
   door. Daniel opens it and pokes his head through the door. Teal'c waits
   outside, carrying a white box.]

     DANIEL
     Hello?

   [Carter smiles.]

     O'NEILL
     In here.

   [Daniel opens the door, and he and Teal'c enter. Daniel looks around
   for the origin of the voice, walking down into the den. He sees O'Neill
   and Carter on the couch.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, sorry are we interrupting anything?

     CARTER & O'NEILL
     No.

     O'NEILL
     What're you doing here?

     DANIEL
     Uh, well, uh, it's a funny story actually. Um, we were driving by
     and we saw Sam's car in the driveway and, um, um...

   [As he speaks, O'Neill taps Carter on the shoulder to get her
   attention.]

     O'NEILL
     Funny.

     DANIEL

     (continuing)
     ...and Teal'c said, well he didn't really say anything, he just
     looked at me and did that eyebrow raising thing that he kinda does
     and I said to him, I said hey, why don't we stop by and--

     O'NEILL

     (looking at the white box)
     Is that doughnuts?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     O'NEILL
     Excellent.

   EXT--P3X-439, NIGHT

   [Anubis' Jaffa kneel before the colonnade. Anubis approaches them,
   flanked by a Kull warrior on either side.]

     ANUBIS
     Rise.

     JAFFA
     My Lord, I believe the humans of the Tau'ri destroyed the device you
     sought.

     ANUBIS
     You failed to stop them.

     JAFFA
     They anticipated our arrival my lord.

   [Anubis raises a hand, motioning them to silence. He turns and leaves.
   as he walks away, the two kull warriors shoot the assembled Jaffa.]

   INT--O'NEIIL'S HOUSE

   [Daniel is balancing an orange on the top of his beer bottle. Carter
   hands Teal'c a glass of fruit juice, then sits, beer in hand. They are
   in the middle of a conversation.]

     O'NEILL
     So wrong. It's the perfect analogy. Burns as Goa'uld.

     TEAL'C
     They are merely animated characters, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     You're so shallow.

   [Daniel drops the orange from the top of his bottle.]

     DANIEL

     Oh please, Teal'c's like one of the deepest people I know, he's sooo
     deep.
     (animated)
     Come, come on, tell them how deep you are. You'll be lucky if you
     understand this.

   [He nods enthusiastically at Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     My depth is immaterial to this conversation.

     DANIEL
     Ooooh! You see!

     O'NEILL
     No more beer for you.

   [Daniel's smile disappears.]

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, Sir, but I have to agree. I don't see the connection.

     O'NEILL
     Alright, that does it. You know the entire VHS collection was going
     to one of you? It's going to Siler, he gets it.

   [There is another knock at the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Thank God, pizza.

   [O'Neill goes to answer the door. He opens it to find Hammond standing
   there.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, you're not the usual delivery boy.

     HAMMOND
     Is this a good time?

     O'NEILL
     It's always a good time for you, Sir. Come on in.

   [Hammond walks to the living room.]

     O'NEILL
     Let me get you a chair.

   [Carter stands as Hammond enters.]

     CARTER
     General.

     HAMMOND
     At ease, Major, at ease.

   [O'Neill enters the room with a chair. He places it behind Hammond.]

     O'NEILL
     There you are, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Glad to find you all here.

   [He sits down, looks at the bottles of beer on the side, and points to
   them.]

     HAMMOND
     You wouldn't happen to have another one of those?

     O'NEILL
     I would.

   [He goes to the dining area, and gets a six pack of bottles.]

     O'NEILL
     I hope you like Guinness, Sir. I find it a refreshing substitute
     for... food.

   [He hands one to Hammond, and takes one for himself.]

     HAMMOND
     I've been relieved of command.

   [There is a pause, as everyone looks shocked.]

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     What?

     HAMMOND
     The President has effectively shut down the SGC for a three month
     review process.

     DANIEL
     Three months?

     HAMMOND
     During which time a newly formed government department will take the
     place of Stargate Command.

     CARTER
     But, Sir, the Colonel. We don't have much time.

     TEAL'C
     How could this happen?

     DANIEL
     Kinsey.

     O'NEILL
     Does anyone know anyone who voted for those two shrubs?

     HAMMOND
     I've known President Hayes for a long time. He's a good man.

     O'NEILL
     Despite his taste in running mates, maybe.

     HAMMOND
     Robert Kinsey brought in a lot of campaign financing and for all we
     know, he may have used his knowledge of the Stargate as leverage to
     get himself a place on the ticket. It doesn't matter now.

     DANIEL
     What, we're just gonna lie down for this?

     O'NEILL
     Now, we've been in this situation before.

     HAMMOND
     No. This time it's different.

     CARTER
     Who's replacing you Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Her name is Doctor Elizabeth Weir.

     O'NEILL
     A civilian?

     DANIEL
     I've heard of her. She's, um, an expert in international politics.
     She, er, she mediates top level negotiations for the UN. I actually
     referenced some of her work when I drafted the first treaty with the
     Tok'ra.

     HAMMOND
     All I know is I've been ordered to Washington to discuss
     reassignment. I leave tomorrow.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, General, we do have a little... unfinished business here.

     HAMMOND
     As far as I know, you'll all to report to work as scheduled on
     Monday.

     TEAL'C
     Something must be done.

     HAMMOND
     I have my orders. Besides, I have a feeling that I may be able to do
     more about this from Washington than I can here.

     CARTER
     And in the meantime?

     HAMMOND
     You'll just have to plead your case to the new administration. I
     have every confidence in you people.

   [SG-1 fall silent, allowing the news to sink in.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Boxes of files are piled up against walls, and on the table in the
   briefing room. A photograph of Chaka lies on top of one of the piles.
   Weir lays a file on top of the pile, then turns towards the window. She
   looks out onto the Stargate, and quietly sighs. Daniel approaches her
   from behind. He waits for a moment before speaking.]

     DANIEL
     Amazing, isn't it.

     WEIR
     I don't really care.

     DANIEL
     Okay.

   [He turns to leave, and Weir turns round to look at him. She gestures
   for him not to go, and points to a handsfree mobile phone earpiece. He
   nods and waits for her to finish her conversation.]

     WEIR

     Well, there's going to be a lot of changes, and not everyone's going
     to be happy about them.
     (pause)
     Yes, I'm just about to step into one myself. Okay, bye.

   [She takes the earpiece off.]

     WEIR
     Sorry, I walk around with this thing and I look like a crazy person
     talking to myself. Elizabeth Weir.

   [She extends her hand, and he shakes it.]

     DANIEL
     Daniel Jackson.

     WEIR
     I can't get used to being this far underground, I keep looking round
     for a window.

     DANIEL
     Uh, I see you've found the one with the best view.

   [He points to the Stargate, and they both stand looking at it.]

     WEIR
     I remember when we were first trying to get the Stargate to work, I
     would just come here, and stare at it for hours.

     WEIR
     Is that, uh, a gentle reminder that you've been an important part of
     this since the beginning?

     DANIEL
     Subtle, huh?

     WEIR
     Hmm.

   [Silence falls between them. Daniel looks back to the table, and points
   to the boxes of files.]

     DANIEL
     So, uh, a little light reading?

     WEIR
     Uh, I've been awake all weekend. I... the reality of this is, is,
     it's an adrenaline rush.

     DANIEL
     Hey, at least I know you have a beating heart.

     WEIR

     (sighs)
     I don't expect the warmest welcome from the military personnel.

     DANIEL
     You're replacing a great man, uniform notwithstanding.

     WEIR
     Okay. But I'm hoping that you of all people, won't jump to
     conclusions.

     DANIEL
     Like why someone like you is here?

     WEIR
     Someone like me?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, someone who started their career as a political activist,
     lobbying against government spending on the military.

     WEIR
     And how I end up working for those I was criticising. I know. But
     I've decided that the best way to stop the proliferation of weapons
     is to try and stop the need for them. So, I'm going to be the voice
     of reason to whoever will listen.

     DANIEL
     And you think that's why the President chose you to take over the
     SGC?

     WEIR
     I don't know why I've been given this job. I really don't. But I'm
     going to do it, to the best of my ability, as long as I'm here. I'm
     going to start by examining the mandate for this program--

     DANIEL
     Don't underestimate the immediate threat.

     WEIR
     No, I'm not. But this country's history of manifest destiny cannot
     be continue out to the rest of the galaxy. especially when this is
     all being done behind the back of the entire planet.

     DANIEL
     Hey, I'm not saying that everything that's been going on here is
     right. I mean we have no right to play God. But neither do the
     Goa'uld. Now I know none of this seems real to you on paper, but
     trust me, they're pure evil. Now, if they had the chance, they would
     either destroy us, or enslave us all. Now, you can read as many
     mission reports as you want, but before you decide what should and
     shouldn't be done round here, why don't you go through that gate,
     and see what's going on for yourself.

   [She nods.]

     WEIR
     In good time.

     DANIEL
     We may not have good time. And Jack O'Neill certainly doesn't.

     WEIR
     I want you to know that Colonel O'Neill's current condition is of
     serious concern to me.

     DANIEL
     And you realise Jack only did what he did, because it was our only
     way to find the location of the Lost City.

   [They are interrupted by an incoming wormhole.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [They turn to look at the gate.]

     WEIR
     All the off world teams are back already.

   [They make their way to the control room.]

     PEARSON
     Doctor Weir, we're receiving Master Bra'tac's personal
     identification code.

     WEIR
     I know what an IDC is, Colonel Pearson.

     DANIEL
     Well, he's our ally, and if you don't open the--

     WEIR

     I understand, thank you.
     (to Harriman)
     Go ahead please.

   [The iris opens. Daniel and Weir go down to the gateroom to meet him.
   They enter the gateroom as Bra'tac emerges from the stargate.]

     DANIEL
     Bra'tac.

   [He nods in greeting. Bra'tac looks at Daniel, then Weir. He frowns.]

     DANIEL
     This is Elizabeth Weir. She's the new leader of this facility.

   [Weir approaches Bra'tac, with a hand extended in friendship. She
   smiles.]

     WEIR
     Hello.

   [Bra'tac looks at her hand, then turns his attention back to Daniel.]

     BRA'TAC
     Has Hammond of Texas fallen in battle?

     WEIR
     No, Sir, he's fine.

   [She is a little taken aback by Bra'tac's comment.]

     DANIEL
     There's been some recent changes in our political leaders.

     BRA'TAC
     I see.

   [He looks disturbed.]

     DANIEL
     Bra'tac, what's wrong?

     BRA'TAC
     I'm afraid I am not the bearer of good news. We've had word from
     Jaffa loyal to our cause. Anubis is gathering the full force of his
     fleet. He will be here, in three days.

   EXT--WHITE HOUSE, DAY

   INT--OVAL OFFICE

   [President Hayes is sat at his desk, on the phone to Kinsey.]

     HAYES
     Bob, could we stop complaining and start figuring out what we're
     going to do?

   [An aide opens the door.]

     AIDE
     Mr. President, General Hammond.

     HAYES

     Show him in.
     (to Kinsey on the phone.)
     We can't ignore a threat of this magnitude. Let's hear the man out.
     Well, whatever he is, and get back to me.

   [He puts down the phone, smiles at Hammond, and get's up to welcome
   him.]

     HAYES
     General George Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     Mr. President.

   [They shake hands.]

     HAYES
     I think it was Lieutenant, last time we spoke, wasn't it?

     HAMMOND
     For both of us. That was a lot of hair ago, Sir.

   [Hayes laughs.]

     HAYES
     Sit down.

   [They sit opposite each other, on the sofas.]

     HAYES
     You know, when I first took this job I thought I had the weight of
     the world on my shoulders. But then I found out what you do for a
     living.

     HAMMOND
     Yes Sir.

     HAYES
     George, this had nothing to do with your record. If the American
     people had any idea what your contribution was--

     HAMMOND
     That you Sir. That's kind of you to say. One day, maybe, they will.

   [Hayes nods.]

     HAYES
     Dr. Weir. She's as smart as they come.

     HAMMOND
     I hope so.

     HAYES
     Poor thing, she has no idea what she's gotten herself into. But I
     had no choice, George, I had to do something. I want you to know I'm
     aware of your history with the Vice President.

     HAMMOND
     Yes Sir.

     HAYES
     Hell, we both know why I picked Kinsey. More than the money, he
     delivered Florida all by himself. Trust me, if I knew then...

     HAMMOND
     Of course.

   [There is a pause, then Hayes, sits back on the sofa, with a change of
   mood.]

     HAYES
     So, let's talk about your reassignment.

     HAMMOND
     I was thinking more along the lines of retirement, Sir.

     HAYES
     I don't think so, George, not just yet. I want to keep you around
     Washington. We're going to need you, and your expertise.

   [Hammond sighs a little, and nods.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bra'tac and SG-1 discuss the news brought by Bra'tac.]

     O'NEILL
     Three days from today is a Thursday. Thursday's not good for us.

     CARTER
     Why now?

     TEAL'C
     If Anubis believes that we know the location of the Lost City...

     CARTER
     We don't.

     O'NEILL
     Not yet.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but he doesn't know that we don't know.

   [Kinsey enters, with Weir and an aide.]

     KINSEY
     Well, some people just don't know when to leave.

     WEIR
     Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c. I know these are strange
     circumstances to be meeting for the first time.

     O'NEILL
     And you are...

     WEIR
     I am Doctor Elizabeth Weir, Colonel.

     KINSEY
     You can just call her your one hope of ever stepping through the
     Stargate again.

     O'NEILL
     Bit of a mouthful.

     WEIR
     I know I'm playing catch up, but, uh, I understand time is short.

     O'NEILL
     Actually, it's all relative, Ma'am. Carter could explain it better
     if we had more time.

     WEIR
     Shall we have a seat, then?

   [They all sit down.]

     WEIR
     Obviously this is a matter of grave importance.

     O'NEILL
     She's quick.

     KINSEY
     Which is why I've taken it upon myself to come on down and hear what
     Mister Bra'tac has to say personally.

     O'NEILL
     Master Bra'tac. Master.

     KINSEY
     I beg your pardon. So, you believe this Goa'uld Anubis is planning
     to attack.

     BRA'TAC
     You may be certain of it.

     KINSEY
     I'll say this, the timing is impeccable. The moment we suspend
     Stargate operations you pull this out of your hat.

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     Mr. Vice President, if you're suggesting that we'd make something
     like this up--

     KINSEY

     (raising his voice)
     Yes, Colonel, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.

     O'NEILL

     (increasingly annoyed)
     Yes, well that is exactly what we do. We sit around on our fat asses
     and create scenarios that put the planet at risk. That's exactly
     what we do.

     KINSEY
     Oh, I'm sure you'd do just about anything.

     WEIR
     Gentlemen, for the purposes of this discussion that Master Bra'tac
     is in earnest. And that the threat is real.

     DANIEL
     Do you even know what the threat is? Anubis is half Goa'uld, half
     ascended Ancient. With the knowledge and technology to wipe us all
     from the face of the Earth.

     WEIR
     What about negotiating?

     O'NEILL
     Oh for crying our loud, that's derentis.

   [All those at the table look at O'Neill, who doesn't seem to notice he
   just spoke Ancient.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL
     You just said derentis.

     O'NEILL
     Did not.

     DANIEL
     Did too.

     O'NEILL
     Derentis, what is that?

     KINSEY
     Latin?

     WEIR
     No, it's not.

     DANIEL
     I think what Colonel O'Neill was trying to say is that based on our
     past experiences, negotiating would be insane, crazy.

     WEIR
     Yeah, I got that.

     CARTER
     However, we believe that there may be alien technology within our
     reach that could defeat Anubis.

     KINSEY
     So now you're pulling a ray gun out of your hat.

     TEAL'C
     There are weapons capable of defending this planet.

     KINSEY
     I can't believe we're sitting here listening to this.

     WEIR
     Mr Vice President, on his last mission--

     KINSEY
     Oh, I am aware of the events that have once again compromised
     Colonel O'Neill's invaluable judgement. And the fact that one his
     last official mission he has incurred the wrath of humanity's worst
     enemy on behalf of us all--

     O'NEILL
     Wait a minute, I thought you didn't buy into the whole invasion
     thing.

   [Kinsey says nothing.]

     WEIR
     The fact is, until we know the location of the Lost City--

     O'NEILL
     I know where it is.

     WEIR
     You know where it is, now?

     O'NEILL
     I will. It's in there somewhere. Look, let me make this simple. I
     come up with the Lost City, we go find it. Yes or no?

     KINSEY
     No!

   [O'Neill continues to look only at Weir.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Weir)
     Who are you? Really? Why are you here?

     WEIR
     I will consider it.

   [Kinsey looks disgusted.]

     O'NEILL

     (nods)
     Thank you.

     WEIR
     You're welcome.

   [SG-1 smile slightly, seeming to realise that Weir is on their side.
   Bra'tac and Teal'c rise.]

     BRA'TAC
     I must return to Chulak.

     TEAL'C
     I too will go.

   [O'Neill looks at Teal'c questioningly.]

     TEAL'C
     In hope of procuring ships and warriors to defend this world.

     WEIR
     Good luck.

   [Teal'c bows, then he and Bra'tac leave. SG-1 then stand up and leave
   the room, leaving Weir and Kinsey alone. Weir gathers up her files and
   leaves for her office. Kinsey looks furious, and follows her, motioning
   for his aide to stay. Weir goes to close her door, but Kinsey stops
   her, closing the door himself. He is furious.]

     KINSEY
     What the hell was that?

     WEIR
     I'm sorry?

     KINSEY
     You don't know O'Neill like I do.

     WEIR

     (sighs)
     This is my call. Colonel O'Neill--

     KINSEY
     Is the one who got us into this mess in the first place.

     WEIR
     I don't see--

     KINSEY
     I want him gone, Doctor, I want them all gone. You haven't figured
     that out yet?

     WEIR
     Oh, I've figured out quite a bit.

     KINSEY
     Well hallelujah for that!

     WEIR
     This is my office, this is my chair. Until someone tells me
     otherwise I'm going to decisions as I see fit, not as they fit into
     your agenda.

     KINSEY
     You have no idea what my agenda is.

     WEIR
     Whatever your agenda is!

     KINSEY
     You don't know anything, Doctor, and if you think you do, you're not
     as smart as I thought.

   [He leaves.]

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

   [Bra'tac and Teal'c stand at the bottom of the ramp, Teal'c wearing
   Jaffa armour. O'Neill stands opposite, with Carter and Daniel standing
   back a little bit.]

     O'NEILL
     So, T.

   [Teal'c faces him.]

     O'NEILL
     If I don't see you again...

     TEAL'C
     I will see you soon, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     You know something I don't?

     TEAL'C
     In fact, it is you that knows something I do not.

     O'NEILL
     I hope you're right.

   [Teal'c extends his arm, which O'Neill takes, and they hug briefly.
   They look at each other, and nod. Teal'c turns to the others.]

     TEAL'C
     I wish you all well.

   [Bra'tac and Teal'c bow, and Daniel, Carter and O'Neill nod in
   acknowledgement. Bra'tac hands Teal'c his staff weapon, and they walk
   slowly up the ramp, Bra'tac briefly looking back. SG-1 watch them
   leave, sadness in their eyes. They enter the event horizon, and O'Neill
   is left contemplating.]
