   EXCERPTS FROM 10.10 "THE QUEST PART 1"

   EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

   [SG-1 walks into the village, getting curious looks from the natives.]

   INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY

     DANIEL

     (reading and translating parchment)
     The Sangreal shall instead belong to he who speaks the guardian's
     name.

     OSRIC
     They say that the Sangreal is protected by the most powerful of
     magical beasts.

   EXT--CLEARING IN WOODS, DAY

     BA'AL
     Amongst the information I obtained regarding the Sangreal is the
     name of the protector.

     VALA

     (to Daniel)
     Protector.

     BA'AL
     The dragon.

   EXT--WOODS, DAY

     OSRIC
     The Sangreal is hidden in a cave beneath a lone mountain.

   EXT--OUTSIDE CAVE ENTRANCE, DAY

     MITCHELL

     (to Osric)
     It's too bad you won't be coming with us.

   [Osric morphs into Adria. SG-1 begin firing at her.]

   INT--CAVERN OF THE SANGREAL

     BA'AL
     There it is. We found it.

   [Daniel and Adria are standing near the dais with the Sangreal. Daniel
   steps forward to take the Sangreal. His hand passes right through it,
   and it blinks, as if it is a hologram. Daniel is surprised for a
   moment.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit as you thought I was.

   [The cavern entrance seals shut behind the group. They try to reach it
   before it closes, but cannot.]

     CARTER
     Hey!

   [Adria and Daniel have rejoined the others. There is a sound of large
   wings flapping.]

     VALA
     We agreed there's no such thing as a dragon, right?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah.

     VALA
     'Cause that looks pretty real to me.

   END EXCERPTS

   TEASER

   [The team, with Adria and Ba'al, are gathered at the edge of the
   cavern, the tunnel behind them still sealed off. The dragon hovers over
   the cavern. It suddenly breathes a huge ball of fire at them. The team
   crouches to get out of the way, although it would be futile. Adria
   remains standing, facing the dragon's attack. But, the fireball is
   repelled and dissipates in the air before it reaches any of them.]

     MITCHELL
     What just happened?

     ADRIA

     I extended my protective shield. (looking at Daniel)
     You're lucky I still need you.

   [The dragon screams and begins to turn.]

     MITCHELL
     Whoa, heads up!

   [The travelers move backward against the wall and drop to the ground.
   The dragon whips its tail at the cave structure around the travelers.
   They duck to avoid being hit, but rocks and dust fall down on all of
   them. The dragon's attack has opened the tunnel again.]

     MITCHELL
     Move out!

   INT--CAVE TUNNEL

   [They retreat into the tunnel and run down one branch, stopping at a
   corner and turning to look backward.]

     VALA

     (relieved)
     Ah. Well, he's too big to fit through the opening, so I think we're
     safe.

   [They look up in concern after hearing the dragon growl and scream.
   Mitchell sees a huge fireball coming down the tunnel toward them.]

     MITCHELL
     Move!

   [Everyone runs further into the tunnel and around a corner. The
   fireball continues straight ahead but doesn't make it around the corner
   to the travelers. Teal'c searches the area with the flashlight on his
   rifle.]

     TEAL'C
     There appears to be an exit this way.

   [He leads the way.]

   EXT--OPEN MEADOW, DAY

   [The travelers jog out of the large mouth of the cave and into a
   meadow.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, what the hell just happened back there?

     DANIEL
     It was a hologram. The Sangreal wasn't real.

     CARTER
     What are you saying? We came all this way for nothing?

     ADRIA
     We have to go back inside.

     BA'AL
     You must be joking.

     ADRIA
     The dragon is the final test.

     BA'AL
     It would be madness to challenge that thing!

   [They hear a low-pitched, loud noise, like rocks being moved. They look
   to their right and upward to see the dragon bursting out of the top of
   the mountain where the Sangreal cavern is. It hovers above the
   resulting crater, then begins to fly toward them. The travelers all
   look up at it.]

     MITCHELL
     I don't think we're gonna have a choice.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--OPEN MEADOW, DAY

   [SG-1 take up positions in a line and begin firing their P-90s at the
   dragon. The bullets cause no damage to it, and it growls and screams as
   if preparing to breathe fire again.]

     MITCHELL
     Tree line!

   [Everyone breaks off and runs for the nearby woods. Carter and Mitchell
   cover the retreat. Mitchell finally follows at a run, carrying his
   backpack. The fireball barely misses them as they make it to the
   trees.]

   EXT--WOODS NEAR OPEN MEADOW, DAY

   [They run a bit further into the woods, then take cover behind boulders
   and trees. Adria stands near Daniel. Mitchell sits against a tree, his
   backpack next to him.]

     VALA
     So, now what?

     BA'AL
     It can't see us as long as we stay in the trees. We should be able
     to make it back to the village.

     DANIEL

     (certain)
     We're not going anywhere. Adria's right: the dragon's the final
     test. We've come too far to give up now.

     BA'AL
     It's just the kind of noble sentiment that's gonna get us all
     killed.

     DANIEL

     (turning toward Ba'al)
     Aren't you, uh, the one that claimed to know the dragon's secret
     name? Time to earn your keep.

     BA'AL
     Ah yes, I may have exaggerated about that slightly. Anyway, you
     didn't think that just by calling out its name, you'd suddenly be
     able to control it?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. Name magic is common in most mythologies. To know
     something's secret name is to steal its power.

     MITCHELL
     So what are we supposed to do, just start guessing?

     VALA
     Daryl, the dragon.

     MITCHELL
     How about Smokey?

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps Puff.

   [Daniel bows his head to concentrate.]

     DANIEL

     (annoyed)
     Would you just give me a minute?

   [They hear the dragon flying overhead, screaming.]

     MITCHELL
     While we're waiting, options?

     CARTER
     Well, we know the P-90 fire just bounced off its armor.

     MITCHELL
     Which means it's not a hologram. If it was a hologram, the bullets
     would have gone straight through.

     BA'AL
     So it's not that your weapons aren't ineffective, it's that they're
     ineffective in a different way.

     MITCHELL
     What I am saying is that if bullets bounce, maybe we should try
     something that packs a little more punch.

   [He pulls out a block of C-4 explosive from his pack, then another.
   Carter pulls a block from her pack and tosses it to Mitchell. Daniel
   does the same. Mitchell pulls some black tape from his tac vest and
   begins taping the C-4 blocks together.]

     MITCHELL
     All right, here is what we're gonna do. We're going to lure Daryl
     down to the ground.

   [Vala smiles at Mitchell's use of her name for the dragon.]

     MITCHELL
     We're gonna take this thing, and we're gonna toss it underneath and
     detonate it near the exposed underbelly. That's where dragons are
     most vulnerable.

   [Daniel sort of nods, but Carter looks skeptical. Mitchell finishes
   constructing the bomb and tosses the detonator to Carter.]

     MITCHELL

     (standing)
     Carter, you detonate from the tree line, and I will do the running.

   [Mitchell holds the bomb in his right hand. As he speaks, Teal'c rushes
   forward and grabs Mitchell's right forearm. Mitchell looks up at
   Teal'c, comprehending. He tries to pull his arm away, but Teal'c
   restrains him.]

     MITCHELL
     That's all right Teal'c; I got this one.

   [Looking out at the meadow, he tries to pull away again and fails.
   Teal'c appears implacable.]

     MITCHELL

     (resigned)
     All right... Off you go.

   [Mitchell gives the device to Teal'c. Teal'c glances at Carter, and she
   nods.]

   EXT--OPEN MEADOW, DAY

   [Appearing very determined, Teal'c runs toward the center of the
   meadow. Carter and Mitchell take up positions behind a boulder so they
   can cover him. Teal'c fires his weapon into the air, drawing the
   dragon. The dragon swoops toward him, and he dives onto the ground. The
   dragon lands on the ground in front of Teal'c and faces him while still
   flapping its wings. Teal'c stands up and throws the bomb at the dragon,
   and it catches it in its mouth and swallows it. Carter activates the
   remote detonator. After a moment the bomb goes off inside the dragon's
   throat. The flames come out of the neck and mouth of the dragon, then
   dissipate. The dragon screams in anger but does not appear injured.
   Teal'c looks at it in disbelief.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, son of a bitch!

     CARTER
     Oh, not good.

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c! Run!

   [Teal'c turns and runs toward the tree-line. The dragon gives chase on
   its feet.]

   EXT--WOODS NEAR OPEN MEADOW, DAY

     VALA

     (falsely bright)
     Hey Daniel! Now would be a really good time.

   [Daniel lowers his P-90 and looks down, concentrating, as he speaks.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, the Parchment of Virtues said the Sangreal would belong to he
     who speaks the Guardian's name. The Guardian's name.

     VALA
     The Guardian is a dragon.

     DANIEL

     (realizing)
     No, the Guardian is not a dragon. The Guardian is the person who set
     this whole thing up. The Guardian is Morgan Le Fay!

     VALA
     Right!

   [Vala stands and begins to run toward the meadow.]

     DANIEL
     Wait! No!

     MITCHELL
     What the hell?

     DANIEL
     Wait!

   [Daniel chases her, carrying his P-90. The dragon growls. Mitchell
   yells then stands and starts to follow, with Carter and Teal'c.]

   EXT--OPEN MEADOW, DAY

   [Vala runs up to where the dragon is standing and flapping its wings.]

     VALA
     Hey! Morgan Le Fay!

   [The dragon stills for a moment, then screams and flaps its wings as if
   to attack.]

     VALA
     Daryl?

   [Daniel arrives running.]

     DANIEL
     Ganos Lal!

   [The dragon lifts off, then blinks into nothingness.]

     MITCHELL

     (from tree-line)
     Wow.

     DANIEL

     (to Vala, breathing hard)
     It's uh, Morgan's name in Ancient.

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Yeah,I know.

   [The others gather at the edge of the meadow, amazed and relieved.
   Adria steps up next to Mitchell, Ba'al on his other side.]

     MITCHELL

     (sarcastically)
     Thanks for the assist.

     BA'AL
     Well to be honest, I wouldn't have been much use to you. My
     strengths lie in strategy and command whereas yours lie in armed
     combat and dealing with, uh...

     CARTER
     Dragons?

     BA'AL
     Clearly.

   [They move off toward Daniel and Vala.]

   INT--CAVERN OF THE SANGREAL

   [The travelers are gathered around the red stone of the Sangreal. It
   appears solid.]

     MITCHELL
     It's real this time, right?

     DANIEL
     I don't see why not.

   [Daniel tries to pick it up but once again, his hand passes through it.
   It is still a hologram.]

     CARTER
     Oh, come on!

   [The blue diamond on the obelisk next to the dais suddenly lights up.
   It is a transportation device like that found on the planet of the
   Sodan. All of the travelers except Adria disappear.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [SG-1 and Ba'al materialize inside a large chamber with antique looking
   furniture and various structures, including a tall piece of stone.
   Torches around the room suddenly light on their own. The team shine
   their flashlights around the room.]

     VALA
     Okay, what just happened?

     CARTER
     I think we were transported into another chamber.

     DANIEL
     Where's Adria?

     CARTER
     I guess she didn't make it.

     DANIEL
     It must be some sort of security measure.

     MITCHELL

     I don't know...
     (pointing to Ba'al with his flashlight)
     it let him in.

     DANIEL
     I don't think Morgan was too concerned about the Goa'uld. It was the
     Ori she was worried about.

     MITCHELL
     You know, I'm not seeing anything around here that looks like a
     Sangreal. Which begets the question, what was she protecting?

     CARTER
     I think I know.

   [Carter directs the team to see what she has found -- an old man
   standing up and encased in what appears to be ice. There is Ancient
   writing on a stone plaque, set into the rock beside the man.]

     DANIEL

     (reading the Ancient)
     "Here lies Myrddin, Archmage of the Round."

     MITCHELL
     All right, that's not a hologram. He's the Real McCoy, right?

     DANIEL
     I think so.

   [Daniel steps closer to the encasement that holds the man, examining
   it.]

     MITCHELL
     How long has he been in there?

     DANIEL
     Well over a thousand years.

     TEAL'C
     We have encountered Ancient stasis technology such as this before.
     General O'Neill was kept in a similar pod in Antarctica.

   [Mitchell walks over to Daniel.]

     MITCHELL
     So, how do we get him out?

     DANIEL
     I have no idea.

   [Vala is investigating another part of the chamber.]

     VALA
     Hey guys! Look at this.

   [She sees a device attached to the tall stone structure. It is an
   Ancient repository of knowledge device such as the one O'Neill put his
   head into twice. Daniel turns to see what she is talking about and is
   immediately alarmed.]

     DANIEL
     Vala, be careful!

   [She steps toward the device and it activates, pushing the viewer
   toward her, but she ducks out of the way in time to avoid it.]

     VALA
     I--

   [She sees past Daniel to where the stasis chamber is deactivating,
   freeing Merlin. Mitchell sees this as well.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, Jackson!

   [Merlin is now free and starts to collapse in the chamber.]

     MITCHELL

     (calling for help)
     Jackson?

   [Daniel and Mitchell each take one of Merlin's arms over their
   shoulders and maneuver him toward a large table.]

     MITCHELL

     (reacting to the weight of him)
     Whoa. We got him.

     DANIEL

     (to Teal'c and Carter, asking them to clear the table)
     Clear it off.

   [They clear the table, and Teal'c places a pillow on it.]

     MITCHELL
     Oof, he's heavier than he looks.

   [Daniel and Mitchell lay Merlin on the table. He is unmoving. Now they
   can see he has long gray hair and a long white beard. The team gather
   around him. He opens his eyes and starts to say a word, then sighs and
   falls unconscious again.]

     VALA
     No. He did not just--

     DANIEL

     (touching Merlin)
     No, he's still alive. It may take him a while to revive completely.

     CARTER

     (taking off her pack)
     All right. In the meantime, we should see if there's a way out of
     here.

   [Carter and Mitchell walk away.]

     BA'AL
     Let us know what you find.

   [Seeing that Ba'al doesn't intend to help, Teal'c grabs him by the
   front of his coat. Ba'al grabs Teal'c's arm but can't move him. He
   starts to move where Teal'c pushes him.]

     BA'AL
     Or, I could come too.

   INT--TUNNELS NEAR MERLIN'S CHAMBER, DAY

   [Mitchell, Carter, Teal'c and Ba'al make their way through, lighting
   their way with their flashlights.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey! There's daylight over here.

   [He leads them to a cave opening.]

   EXT--FIRST WORLD, DAY

   [They are clearly on a different planet than where they found the
   Sangreal. It is a hot and windy desert world, and there is a DHD and
   Stargate just outside the cave. An obelisk like the one that had lit up
   just before they were transported from the cavern is sitting in the
   sand as well.]

     MITCHELL

     (pointing out the obvious)
     You know, I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is
     different.

     CARTER
     We weren't just transported to another chamber, we were transported
     to another planet.

     BA'AL
     The gate must have been activated remotely, then the obelisk beamed
     us through the wormhole.

     MITCHELL
     Well, as far as I'm concerned, the more distance between us and
     Adria, the better.

     CARTER
     Except that she has the knowledge of the Ori. She knows as much
     about the gates and the DHDs as the people who built them. If anyone
     can track us, it's her.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, except that.

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel and Vala investigate the chamber while waiting for Merlin to
   awaken.]

     DANIEL
     It's amazing how similar this is to the myth.

     VALA
     Hmm?

     DANIEL
     Supposedly, Morgan trapped Merlin in a cave and left him frozen
     there for all eternity. Only in reality, I think she was trying to
     protect him.

     VALA
     How do you mean?

     DANIEL

     (stepping to the opposite side of Merlin from her)
     Well, I'm starting to think that maybe Morgan did destroy the
     Sangreal after all. I mean, she probably figured she had no choice.
     That if she didn't do it, the other Ancients would have just sent
     someone else.

     VALA
     So instead, she did the next best thing.

     DANIEL
     She preserved the one man capable of building it again.

   [Mitchell and the others return from the surface.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, it's official: we are stuck here. Wherever "here" is. The good
     news is, we found a gate. Teal'c's watching it. Bad news is...

     CARTER
     We can't dial out. Somebody tampered with the DHD.

     BA'AL
     I can fix it. Reprogramming dialing devices is my speciality.

   [As they speak, Merlin begins to stir awake. He tries to sit up.]

     VALA

     (seeing him move)
     Whoops!

   [Daniel and Vala rush to help Merlin sit up on the table.]

     VALA
     Guess who's coming around?

   [Merlin turns and sits on the edge of the table. Daniel holds onto his
   arm.]

     MERLIN
     Where am I?

     CARTER
     Good question.

   [Merlin takes notice of Carter.]

     MERLIN

     You look familiar.
     (walking toward her)
     Guinevere!
     (hugging her)
     Oh my dear, it's been too long.

     CARTER

     (uncomfortable)
     Uh, it's good to see you, too.

     MERLIN

     (indicating Mitchell)
     Percival!

   [He turns and walks toward Daniel.]

     MERLIN
     And Galahad! Oh brave knights. Fortune indeed does smile upon me to
     see your faces again.

     BA'AL
     Looks like Merlin's drawbridge no longer goes all the way across the
     moat, if you catch my meaning.

     MERLIN

     (turning to Ba'al)
     What's that? Mordred. I might have known it.

     BA'AL
     We're wasting our time with this old fool! We need to get back to
     the gate so I can start reprogramming--

     MERLIN

     (gesturing with one hand)
     Be silent!

   [Ba'al grabs at his throat and tries but fails to make any sounds.
   Merlin walks over to the circular platform. Ba'al looks annoyed.]

     MITCHELL
     Well, how do you like that? The old boy still has some tricks up his
     sleeve.

   [Daniel walks over to Merlin and ends up facing him across the
   platform.]

     DANIEL

     (insistent)
     Merlin? Myrddin! We need you to remember. About the Sangreal. About
     Morgan and about how you got here.

     MERLIN
     Morgan.

     DANIEL
     You also knew her as Ganos Lal.

     MERLIN
     I haven't heard that name spoken in a very long time.

     DANIEL
     We're not Knights of the Round Table.

     MITCHELL
     Though we are flattered by the comparison.

     DANIEL
     A thousand years have passed. We know who you really are. We know
     about Atlantis, and we've encountered the Ori.

     MERLIN

     (intensely)
     Tell me more.

     DANIEL

     (at a loss)
     I don't know where to begin.
     (to the others)
     This is gonna take a while.

     MITCHELL

     (to Daniel)
     All right, we'll get started checking out the cave.

   [He leaves a canteen on the platform, beside Daniel, and takes Daniel's
   flashlight.]

     MITCHELL

     (shining the flashlight in Ba'al's face)
     Unless you have any objections. No? Great; move out.

   [They leave Daniel, Vala, and Merlin in the cavern.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The village is controlled by Ori soldiers. A soldier leads Adria
   through the square as other soldiers push villagers out of the way.]

     ORI COMMANDER
     Make way for the Orici!

   [Adria approaches the Prior whom she has commanded before, with one eye
   scarred over.]

     ADRIA
     What happened?

     PRIOR
     The gate activated on its own, and only seconds later it closed
     again.

     ADRIA

     (irritated)
     I don't suppose anyone saw the address.

     PRIOR
     No, Orici.

     ADRIA

     (sighing and rolling her eyes)
     I'll need to examine the dialing device.
     (to Guard)
     Ready your men. As soon as I determine where they went, we're
     leaving.

     ORI COMMANDER
     Yes, Orici.

     PRIOR
     And what of the village?

     ADRIA
     Have they agreed to accept the teachings of Origin?

     PRIOR
     No.

     ADRIA

     (as if stating the obvious)
     Then burn it.

   [She walks away from the Prior.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel and Vala sit side by side on the table where Merlin had been
   lying. Merlin sits in the chair beside them.]

     DANIEL
     ...And it was Morgan who finally led us to you. Of course, she
     couldn't come right out and tell us. She had to be annoyingly
     cryptic about the whole thing.

     MERLIN
     You have an unusual understanding of the way of Ascended Beings.

     DANIEL
     Yes, that's partly because I used to be one myself.

     MERLIN
     The human race could not have progressed that far in only a thousand
     years.

     DANIEL
     No, I had a little help. Her name was Oma Desala.

     MERLIN
     Of course. And what happened?

     DANIEL
     Well I, I guess I didn't exactly see eye-to-eye with The Others.

     MERLIN
     Ah, yes. I find myself in a similar position.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I wasn't too good at the whole "non-interference thing." I
     guess there were a few arguments. At least that's the impression I
     got.

     MERLIN
     You don't remember?

     DANIEL
     No. In order to protect me, Oma erased it all from my mind and sent
     me back.

     MERLIN

     (standing, exasperated)
     Oh, I'm surprised she still hasn't learned her lesson.

     VALA
     She's not the only one who broke some of the rules.

     MERLIN
     The Ori gain their power from the lower planes. So much so that one
     day they shall be strong enough to wipe The Others out. In the face
     of such a threat, the strict policy of non-interference is absurd.

     DANIEL
     I'm sure Oma would agree with you.

     MERLIN

     Oma concerns herself with the individual. She may have the best
     intentions, but then, so did the Ori when they first began.
     (somberly, to Daniel)
     Still, she must have seen something in you, to believe you to be
     worthy.

   [As Daniel looks on, Merlin closes his eyes and lowers his head.
   Mitchell enters the cavern, followed by Carter and Ba'al.]

     MITCHELL
     This cave is a bust. There's nothing else here.

   [Mitchell notes Merlin in something of a meditation pose.]

     MITCHELL
     Ah, how's it going?

     DANIEL
     I'm not exactly sure.

     MERLIN

     (waking, determined)
     Before I agree to join with you, I need to know that you are willing
     to do whatever must be done to see it through.

     VALA
     Surely you have some idea of what we've been through to get here.

     MERLIN
     What you experienced so far is as nothing compared to what is to
     come.

   [The team exchange concerned looks.]

     MITCHELL
     Don't worry about us. We're on board.

     MERLIN
     In that case, there's much work to be done.

   [Merlin walks quickly to the knowledge download device. He places his
   hands below it, and two lighted handle-like devices extend to his
   hands. The viewer portion extends as well, to his face. The
   four-pronged pattern at the center of the circular platform lights up,
   and holograms of various small patterns appear above it.]

   EXT--FIRST WORLD, DAY

   [The gate sits near a large outcropping of rock that houses the cave.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Merlin is still in contact with the repository device. Vala looks at
   him, then looks at her watch and huffs in frustration. She walks over
   to Daniel, who is standing next to Carter. Mitchell and Ba'al sit
   nearby.]

     VALA
     He's been at it for hours, Daniel. Wanna take a guess at what he's
     doing?

   [The hologram above the platform show models of molecules moving and
   joining.]

     DANIEL
     Well from the looks of it, I'd say he's virtually piecing something
     together from base molecules.

     CARTER
     Another Sangreal?

   [Daniel shakes his head as if he doesn't know enough to say. Merlin
   suddenly steps away from the device, and it deactivates. He is very
   tired and stumbles backward. Daniel and Carter rush to help him walk.]

     MERLIN
     Thank you. I'm fine. Just, I just needed a rest.

   [As they are helping, the chamber is filled with a strange light that
   shimmers across the space then disappears quickly.]

     MITCHELL

     (standing)
     What was that?

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     Colonels Mitchell and Carter: come quickly. You will want to see
     this.

   [Carter hands Merlin off to Vala.]

     MITCHELL

     (tapping Ba'al on the shoulder)
     Let's go.

   [The three leave quickly.]

   EXT--PLANET TWO, NIGHT

   [Mitchell, Carter, and Ba'al join Teal'c. It is night, cold, windy,
   with snow flurries.]

     TEAL'C
     The gate activated on its own. The crystal on the obelisk began to
     glow, and then everything changed.

     CARTER
     I'll say.

     MITCHELL
     We've been transported to another planet.

     CARTER
     Well if Daniel's right and Morgan wanted to keep Merlin hidden, this
     would be a great way to do it. My guess is, we're traveling through
     a circuit of planets, cut off from the rest of the gate system by a
     deliberate alteration of the DHD program.

     TEAL'C
     Then you believe we will be unable to dial out from this gate as
     well.

     CARTER
     Well, we can give it a shot, but yeah, I doubt it'll work. Until we
     find the automatic dialing program in the DHD processor and shut it
     down.

     MITCHELL
     You can do that, right?

     CARTER
     I hope so.

   [She climbs down the steep steps to the DHD. The obelisk is just beyond
   it.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Merlin sits on a divan, resting. Daniel and Vala sit beside each other
   on a bench next to him.]

     MERLIN
     I have lived many lifetimes. First... in Atlantis. Then... on Earth,
     before the dawn of your civilization. Then I joined the ranks of the
     Ascended. And finally, I returned to mortal form, to live out my
     remaining days among the noblemen of Arthur's Court. Or, so I
     thought. And through all these eons, only one thing has stayed the
     same: there is never enough time.

     DANIEL

     (comforting)
     Well, we're safe for the moment. You can take all the time you need.

     MERLIN
     I slept too long. My body betrays me.

     VALA
     We're not about to let you give up now.

     DANIEL
     You realize what's at stake. If you don't help us, the Ori will take
     this galaxy.

     MERLIN

     (sighing in agreement)
     One last task, then. Before I rest.

   [Daniel and Vala help Merlin up. He walks over to the device and puts
   his hands together and touches his mouth, as if in preparation. He
   turns back to look at Daniel.]

     MERLIN
     Good luck, Doctor Jackson.

   [Daniel glances at Vala, questioning. Merlin activates the device.
   After a moment, the normal green light is replaced by a bright white
   light that envelopes most of his head. After a moment, he is thrust
   backward and falls to the floor before Daniel or Vala can stop him.
   They kneel beside Merlin. His eyes are fixed open; he takes one last
   breath, then stops. Daniel puts his fingers on Merlin's neck, beneath
   his beard.]

     VALA
     What just happened?

     DANIEL
     He's dead.

   [Some time later, Merlin lies on the table that he first rested on, his
   arms crossed over his chest. Vala sits in a chair nearby, and Daniel
   stands next to Merlin's body.]

     CARTER

     (reviewing what Daniel must have told her)
     He said, "Good luck."

     VALA

     (standing)
     Very strange. It's almost as if he knew it was going to happen.

     MITCHELL
     Which leaves us with no Sangreal and, for the moment, no way off
     this planet.

     BA'AL
     I told you I can fix the dialing device.

   [The others look at him, surprised to hear him speak.]

     BA'AL
     Merlin's little trick with my vocal cords expired at the same moment
     he did.

     TEAL'C
     Yet another reason to mourn his passing.

     BA'AL
     Joke all you want, Teal'c, but I am the only one who can get us out
     of here.

     CARTER

     (to Mitchell)
     He is good with dialing programs. Maybe if we work together...

   EXT--PLANET TWO, NIGHT

   [Carter works at the DHD using a tablet computer while Mitchell and
   Teal'c look on and patrol. Blizzard-like conditions continue.]

     CARTER
     I'm having trouble finding the relocation program. It must be buried
     in one of the correlative subroutines.

     BA'AL
     We'll never find it using those search protocols. I'm gonna have to
     make some adjustments to your program.

     MITCHELL
     How much longer is this gonna take?

     BA'AL
     It's impossible to say. All I know for sure is it would have been a
     lot easier on that nice, warm desert planet.

   [He takes the table computer from Carter.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel stands beside Merlin's body, concentrating.]

     DANIEL
     He said he had one more thing to do before he could rest.

     VALA
     Huh! I thought he meant, build us another weapon.

     DANIEL
     No, you were right before. He knew he didn't have enough time.

   [He walks over to the knowledge device, which is still extended from
   the stone.]

     DANIEL
     Now this is obviously some sort of virtual interface, like a
     computer-assisted design program. Only in the past, we've seen it
     used to download information into someone's mind.

     VALA
     What sort of information?

     DANIEL
     All the knowledge of the Ancients.

     VALA
     That's a lot.

     DANIEL
     Yes. As a matter of fact, it's too much for a human brain to handle.
     It's fatal. But what if you could control it? Use it to store and
     load something more specific.

     VALA
     Like?

     DANIEL
     I'm not sure.

   [He looks behind himself, toward Merlin's body. Vala turns to look as
   well. Having distracted her, Daniel suddenly turns back, steps up to
   the device, and grabs the handles. The device activates, its green
   light shining on Daniel's face.]

     VALA
     Hey!

   [Daniel closes his eyes, shuddering, but a bright light approaches.
   Vala looks on, worried.]

   EXT--PLANET TWO, NIGHT

     VALA

     (over radio)
     Vala here. I'm going to need some help.

     MITCHELL
     What is it?

     VALA
     It's Daniel.

     MITCHELL

     (to Carter)
     Keep working!

     CARTER

     (wanting to join him)
     Cam!

     MITCHELL

     (indicating Ba'al)
     I do not trust him to finish on his own, Sam!

   [Mitchell rushes back toward the cave.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Mitchell comes running in to find Vala on the floor, holding an
   unconscious Daniel. Vala is resting her head on his and looks
   distraught.]

     MITCHELL

     (admonishing)
     Jackson?

   [He kneels beside them and grabs Daniel's vest.]

     MITCHELL

     Jackson!
     (to Vala)
     What did he do?

   EXT--FIRST WORLD, DAY

   [Adria has found the first planet. She stares at the DHD and obelisk,
   surrounded by Ori soldiers. The Prior approaches her.]

     PRIOR
     The planet is lifeless. There is no one here.

     ADRIA
     They were here. I'm certain of it.

     PRIOR
     What would you have us do?

     ADRIA
     Lead the men in prostration. I will inform you when I have the next
     address.

     PRIOR
     Yes, Orici.

   [She walks up to the DVD and holds her gloved hand over it. The glyphs
   light up rapidly in a seemingly random pattern.]

   EXT--SECOND WORLD, NIGHT

   [Ba'al stands up from where he has been working at the base of the
   DHD.]

     BA'AL
     Try it now!

   [Carter activates something on her tablet.]

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     I'm still not reading any anomalies.

     BA'AL

     (rubbing his hands to warm them)
     This is ridiculous! I can't-- I can't be expected to work like this!
     I can barely see, my fingers are numb! I say, we go back inside, we
     warm up, we take our chances on the next planet.

     TEAL'C
     How do you know it will not be worse?

   [The glyphs on the DHD start lighting, and the gate chevrons begin
   activating.]

     CARTER
     We're about to find out!

   [The three gather and watch the DHD.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel is seated, his head in his hands. Seated beside him is Vala.
   Mitchell walks by and pats her on the shoulder. She smiles at him. The
   flash of light indicating they have moved flashes again. Vala flinches
   in surprise.]

     VALA
     Ooh! Merlin's gone.

   [The table where Merlin's body had lain is empty.]

     MITCHELL

     Well that's just... weird.
     (into radio)
     Sam, what just happened?

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [The planet is slightly foggy, with dead leaves all over the ground.
   The DHD, obelisk, and Stargate are just where they have been in
   relation to each other and the cave.]

     CARTER
     The obelisk transported us to another planet. I think it's scheduled
     to go off every couple of hours.

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     How are things out there?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Well, it's a little spooky, but at least it's warm. How's Daniel?

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel is hunched over, his hands covering his ears.]

     MITCHELL

     (into radio)
     He's... sitting up. I'll get back to you on the rest.

   [Daniel slowly raises his head. He's not wearing his glasses.]

     VALA

     (reaching for a canteen)
     Hey!

   [Mitchell crouches in front of Daniel.]

     MITCHELL
     How you doing, Sunshine?

   [Daniel looks at Mitchell with some confusion, blinking slowly.]

     DANIEL

     He was right.
     (smiling)
     You do look like Percival.

     MITCHELL
     Excuse me?

     DANIEL
     We spent a lot of time in this room.

     VALA
     Who did?

     DANIEL

     We did.
     (correcting himself)
     He did. Merlin. Sorry, it's a little confusing having two sets of
     memories in your head. He wasn't kidding about living many
     lifetimes.

   [Daniel suddenly stands, using Mitchell's shoulder as leverage. He
   takes a few steps away from them.]

     VALA
     You have Merlin's memories?

     DANIEL
     Some of them. Earth, Atlantis, and the different medieval societies
     he set up throughout the galaxy. And the work he did in this lab.

     MITCHELL
     Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hang on a second. Are you telling me you can
     build the Sangreal?

     DANIEL
     He knew he didn't have the strength to finish it. His body had
     deteriorated too much during the stasis. So he gave me the
     knowledge.

   [Daniel steps up to the knowledge device and activates it. The green
   light shines, and holographic images of small pieces of the Sangreal
   come to life.]

     MITCHELL
     Wait!

   [The holographic pieces start assembling themselves.]

     DANIEL
     I can see it now. I can do this.

   [Mitchell looks torn. Vala steps up to him.]

     MITCHELL
     Twice a device like that almost killed General O'Neill. Both times,
     it took the Asgard to save him.

     VALA
     Daniel thought that this device might be different. That somehow the
     information could be limited.

     MITCHELL
     I hope he's right.

   [The holographic pieces continue to assemble.]

   EXT--PLANET TWO, NIGHT

   [Adria is there with her guards and the Prior. A guard comes out from
   the cave.]

     ORI COMMANDER
     We found the body of an old man. Dead. Apart from that, there's
     nothing here.

     ADRIA
     This is beginning to try my patience.

     PRIOR
     Is there no other way we can track them?

     ADRIA
     No. But each time, I'm able to determine their destination more
     quickly than the last. Sooner or later, we will catch up to them.

   [Adria places her hand over the DHD as she did before.]

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [Carter and Ba'al continue to work on the DHD, with Teal'c keeping
   watch.]

     CARTER
     Maybe we're barking up the wrong tree, here. Maybe the relocation
     program isn't in the DHD processor at all.

     BA'AL

     What, the obelisk?
     (laughing)
     You obviously have no idea what you are talking about.

     CARTER
     Says the brainiac who spent three days trapped in that force field.

     BA'AL
     That technology is strictly used for localized transport.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I know. I mean it's obviously what's beaming us through the
     gate every time there's an open wormhole. But what if it also
     contains a remote dialer?

     BA'AL
     It's one thing to send someone here and there on the surface of the
     planet. It's quite another to send them half way across the galaxy.
     It's like, uh, comparing a laptop to a super computer.

     CARTER
     Well, it wouldn't have to contain the entire navigational system,
     now would it? Just a command code sufficient to override normal
     dialing protocols.

     BA'AL
     Yes. But to borrow a rather quaint human phrase: "why hide a needle
     in a small haystack, when you can use an enormous one?" It wouldn't
     be much of a security measure if it could be discovered by the first
     Tau'ri female that comes along, would it, now?

   [Teal'c turns to look at him. Carter turns around slowly as well.]

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, are you dismissing my idea out of hand because I'm human
     or because I'm a woman?

     BA'AL
     Huh. A little of both, I suppose.

     CARTER

     (smiling falsely)
     You know what, I'll check it myself.

   [She walks up to the obelisk with a small scanner.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel is still working with the knowledge device. Several large
   pieces join to form a disk-shaped object. It settles to the top of the
   platform and materializes. The machine shuts off. Daniel steps away,
   rubbing his eyes and stumbling a bit.]

     MITCHELL
     What is that?

     DANIEL
     Stage one. The first step towards creating Merlin's weapon.

     VALA
     It's real?

   [She touches it.]

     DANIEL

     (breathing heavily)
     Yeah. That's exactly what this device does. It allows you to design
     and configure something virtually and then materializes it.

     MITCHELL
     Just like O'Neill did when he created the anti-Replicator weapon.

   [Daniel nods agreement.]

     VALA
     I thought the Sangreal was a tiny red jewel.

     DANIEL
     No, that's the-- that's the final stage. The key to making the whole
     thing work.

     MITCHELL
     So, how long before you can put the whole thing together?

   [Daniel suddenly leans forward against the platform and raises a hand
   to his face.]

     VALA
     Daniel?

     DANIEL

     (unzipping and removing his vest)
     No. I'm all right, I'm all right. It's just, this machine takes a
     lot out of you. The uh, level of concentration required is pretty
     intense.

   [He holds his hand to his eye.]

     VALA
     Can I get you anything?

     DANIEL
     Water.

     VALA
     Sure.

   [She turns and steps over to the table where the canteen is. As she
   reaches for it, it flies through the air to Daniel, whose hand is
   outstretched. He pulls it from the air. Mitchell stands up straight in
   shock.]

     DANIEL

     (ironically)
     Okay, that happened.

   [He unscrews the cap from the canteen.]

     DANIEL
     It's interesting. Jack got healing powers; I guess I got
     telekinesis.

   [He takes a drink. He is still leaning against the platform with his
   other hand.]

     VALA
     Jack also almost died! Now you said that this device might be
     different.

     DANIEL
     I'll be fine.

     MITCHELL
     That's crap! She's right, you don't get fancy mind powers unless
     there has been major redecorating going on inside your skull!

     DANIEL
     Look, obviously, creating the weapon requires a higher level of
     brain function. Now, Merlin would have foreseen that. Trust me, I
     can handle this.

   [He drinks more water.]

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [Carter has a panel on the obelisk open and is examining the control
   pathways.]

     CARTER
     Damn it!

   [Ba'al continues to use the tablet computer attached to the DHD. Carter
   reluctantly approaches him and clears her throat. He looks up.]

     BA'AL
     What do you want?

     CARTER
     I need your help. Look, I still think I'm right about the obelisk,
     but I can't make heads or tails of its programming.

     BA'AL

     (chuckling)
     Well, that's hardly surprising. I mean, I know where you come from,
     you're considered relatively intelligent, but by galactic standards
     that's not really saying much. Wouldn't you agree?

   [Carter starts to turn away, then turns back and punches Ba'al in the
   face. He falls to the ground, clutching at his nose.]

     CARTER
     You know, if you're not gonna help, then you're really not much use
     to us. And if you're not much use to us, then there's really no
     point in keeping you alive any longer. Wouldn't you agree?

   [He sits up, chuckling nervously. His nose is bleeding. He looks to
   Teal'c, who smiles at him.]

     BA'AL
     I'd, uh, be delighted to help.

   [He reaches his hand out to her for her to help him up. She smiles at
   him falsely.]

     CARTER
     Great to hear it.

   [She reaches for his hand, but instead of pulling him up, she slaps the
   small sensor into his hand. She walks away, and he starts laughing to
   himself.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel is working the machine again. A second disk-shaped piece lowers
   from the holographic field and materializes on top of the first stage.
   The machine deactivates.]

     MITCHELL

     (looking at the platform)
     Stage two.

     DANIEL
     Indeed.

   [He steps back haltingly from the device.]

     DANIEL
     I must rest. I'm not as young as I used to be.

   [He walks to the divan as if he is an old man, with Merlin's halting
   walk. He sits sideways on the couch. Vala walks over and crouches in
   front of him, putting a hand on his knee.]

     VALA
     Daniel? Are you all right?

     DANIEL
     I know you.

     VALA
     Well of course you do, silly. It's me! Vala!

   [She smiles. He smiles back and puts his hand along the side of her
   face.]

     DANIEL
     I had the strangest dream. Everything was covered in ice.

   [Vala looks up at Mitchell with concern. Daniel is breathing hard, his
   eyes glazed and his mouth partly open.]

     MITCHELL

     Jackson!
     (touching his shoulder)
     Daniel.

   [Daniel flinches, takes a deep breath, and comes back to himself.]

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

   [He looks behind him, but Vala pulls his face back toward her.]

     VALA

     (concerned)
     We're losing you, that's what's going on. Every time you come back
     from that machine, it gets a little worse. And don't tell me you're
     fine.

   [She is teary-eyed.]

     DANIEL

     (breathing heavily)
     No. No, I just have too many thoughts in my head. I--I can't
     concentrate. I get confused.

     VALA
     You have to fight it.

     DANIEL

     (putting his fingers to his temples)
     No, no, no! That's the thing; I have to let it happen. That's the
     only way I can build Merlin's weapon.

   [Vala looks at Mitchell as if pleading. He looks worried but doesn't
   react. Daniel pushes himself up from the couch and stumbles toward the
   machine. Mitchell touches his arm and pats him on the back as he
   passes.]

     VALA

     (to Mitchell)
     Hey, you have to tell him that he doesn't have to do this. He'll
     listen to you.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, what team have you been on? Besides, we need this one.

     VALA
     What makes you think we'll even be allowed to use it? The Ancients
     didn't let Merlin get away with it last time--

     MITCHELL

     (raising a finger to her)
     Vala, Vala... sh-- shut up. For once. We have to take the risk.

   [He walks away from her. Behind them, Daniel has reactivated the
   device.]

     VALA

     (calling after him)
     What? This is all about noble sacrifice for you, isn't it?

   [She catches up to him. They are out of earshot of Daniel.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh uh, I'm sorry, what about you?

     VALA
     What?

     MITCHELL
     When you flew that cargo ship into the gap of the Supergate, you
     knew damned well that you might not come out the other side alive.

     VALA
     No, that was different.

   [She turns away from him. He takes her arm.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, different because you were the one taking the risk.

   [They struggle for a moment as she tries to step away and he grabs her
   vest with both hands. She stills.]

     MITCHELL

     (somberly and intensely)
     Well now you know that the hard part about being part of this team
     is not risking your own life. It's watching your friends take
     chances with theirs. Congratulations. Now you really are one of us.

   [He walks away as she remains, tears in her eyes.]

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [Teal'c walks around the obelisk where Carter and Ba'al are working on
   a panel. He stands behind them.]

     CARTER
     It's a command override. I can't believe we actually found it.

     TEAL'C
     Clearly you work well together.

   [They both look at Teal'c in surprise and discomfort.]

     CARTER
     Well, now that we've identified the program, it should be a simple
     matter to shut it down.

   EXT--SECOND PLANET, NIGHT

   [The Ori soldiers stand in formation in front of the gate. Adria
   continues to work on the DHD mentally, the glyphs lighting very
   quickly. The gate begins to dial.]

     ADRIA

     (smiling)
     Ready your men. It's time.

     ORI COMMANDER
     Yes, Orici.

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel shuts down the machine.]

     MITCHELL
     What is it?

     DANIEL
     Get to the gate, now.

     MITCHELL
     Why?

   [Daniel turns toward them, a look of fear on his face.]

     DANIEL
     They're coming.

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [The gate begins to dial.]

     CARTER
     Incoming wormhole!

   [Teal'c approaches. Ba'al takes cover behind the DHD. Carter moves
   behind the obelisk and draws her P-90. The wormhole activates. Teal'c
   goes to his knee and raises his weapon. Ori soldiers begin to come
   through, and Teal'c and Carter shoot them. But they are not able to get
   all the soldiers, and some begin to take positions in the woods and
   fire back with their Ori staff weapons.]

     BA'AL
     Hold them here! I'll get help!

   [Ba'al stands but is immediately shot by a soldier using a
   wrist-mounted stun weapon. He falls. Mitchell and Vala exit the caves
   already firing. They take out several guards, but more are still
   coming. The obelisk activates.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Adria materializes inside the chamber. Daniel is partially sitting on
   the table, clearly weakened.]

     ADRIA
     Doctor Jackson.

   [He rubs his eyes, stands, and moves toward her.]

     DANIEL
     You're too late.

     ADRIA
     You haven't completed the weapon. I'd say I'm just in time.

     DANIEL
     And I'd say things are different now.

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [The sky above is now filled with dark grey, roiling clouds. Lightening
   forms and travels down to the ground, hitting each of the Ori soldiers,
   striking them dead. The team looks on in shock. The gate has now
   deactivated.]

   INT--MERLIN'S CHAMBER

   [Daniel falls to his knees.]

     ADRIA
     Draining isn't it? Instead of helping your friends, you should have
     saved your energy to deal with me.

   [She crouches beside him.]

     DANIEL
     Would it have made a difference?

   [She takes his face in her gloved hand and turns it toward her.]

     ADRIA

     (smiling)
     Probably not.

   EXT--THIRD PLANET, DAY

   [The battle is over.]

     MITCHELL
     What was that?

     CARTER

     (jogging back to the DHD and dialing)
     I don't know, but I say we don't stick around to find out. Let's
     dial out of here before anyone else can dial in.

     VALA
     I'm gonna go check on Daniel.

   [She turns to the cave. Daniel literally comes flying out of the cave
   and lands on the ground beside the DHD. Mitchell and Vala go to him.
   Carter looks on in shock.]

     VALA
     Daniel?

   [Adria comes to the mouth of the cave. Mitchell, Carter, and Teal'c
   fire at her, but her personal shield protects her. After a moment, they
   stop.]

     MITCHELL
     Why do I bother?

     VALA

     (standing)
     Adria, I want you to stop this right now!

     ADRIA
     I'm sorry it has to be this way, Mother.

   [She raises her hand slightly. Red energy tendrils form in it. She
   launches the energy toward Vala and the others. Daniel jumps up and
   puts himself in the way. He holds up his left hand and fires white
   energy back at her. The two energy forms fight each other.]

     DANIEL

     (with great effort)
     Get through the gate, now!

     CARTER
     We're not leaving you here!

     DANIEL
     I'll be right behind you!

   [Mitchell grabs Vala and takes her to the gate and into the wormhole.
   Carter and Teal'c reluctantly follow. They leave Ba'al behind. Daniel
   and Adria continue to battle. Finally she stops, and so does he. He
   falls to the ground. The gate deactivates. Adria walks over to him and
   smiles slightly. He is conscious but too weak to move.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Vala holds a notebook in one hand and types on Daniel's computer with
   the other. Carter and Teal'c are inside the office. Mitchell stands in
   the doorway.]

     VALA

     (frustrated)
     There has to be a way we can get back to that planet.

     CARTER
     A DHD buffer typically holds that last fifty addresses that were
     dialed, and we went through three gates before getting there. We've
     got a lot of planets to check.

     VALA
     Adria found a way around the problem.

     TEAL'C
     Even if we could return to the planet, at this point, I fear it will
     do us little good.

   [Vala pounds on the keys and grunts in frustration. Carter walks up to
   her and stops her. Vala steps away and walks past Teal'c toward
   Mitchell.]

     VALA
     At least we'd be doing something.

   [She walks past Mitchell. He grabs her arm to stop her.]

     MITCHELL
     Merlin gave Daniel some pretty valuable intel. Adria knows that.

   [Vala looks away.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey! She'll keep him alive.

   [Vala calms down and taps Mitchell on the hand. He lets her go, and she
   leaves.]

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   [An Ori warship moves through hyperspace.]

   INT--ORI WARSHIP

   [Daniel sits on the floor at the edge of a large, empty room. His knees
   are drawn up, and he rests his head on his hands. Adria appears outside
   the translucent door then enters.]

     ADRIA
     How are you feeling?

     DANIEL

     (chuckling slightly)
     I don't suppose you know what a hangover is.
     (sighing at her confused look)
     Never mind.

   [In the light, blood and bruises are visible on his face, from their
   earlier fight.]

     ADRIA
     I know the burden must be awful. Your brain simply wasn't built to
     handle that much information.

   [He throws his head back.]

     DANIEL
     Well, whatever I had, it's gone. Along with what feels like half my
     brain cells.

     ADRIA
     You'll forgive me if I don't take your word for it.

   [He looks at her with surprise.]

     ADRIA
     Now rest. We have a lot of work to do.

   [Daniel looks very concerned.]

   FADE OUT
