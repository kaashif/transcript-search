   EXT--JACK O'NEILL'S HOUSE, DAY

   [O'Neill gets out of his truck and pulls some beer and groceries from
   the back seat. He walks to his front door, and spotting the door is
   open, puts down his groceries, takes off his sunglasses and reaches
   behind him to pull out a gun. He pushes the door open and moves
   cautiously into the house. Carefully checking the hallway, he advances
   into the living room and aims his weapon at Senator Robert Kinsey, who
   is standing in front of the fireplace. Kinsey holds up a bottle of
   whisky.]

     KINSEY
     Bad news. You're out of scotch.

   [Kinsey pours a glass of whisky]

   [O'Neill lowers his weapon]

     O'NEILL
     Well, if I'd known you were coming, I'd have hidden the good stuff.

   [Kinsey sits down in an armchair, sniggering.]

     KINSEY
     If you'd known I was coming, I doubt I'd have made it through the
     door.

   [O'Neill goes over to the coffee table, picks up his phone and begins
   to dial.]

     KINSEY
     Who are you calling?

     O'NEILL
     Local sheriff's a friend of mine.

     KINSEY

     (amused)
     I may be disgraced, but I'm not wanted for any crimes.

     O'NEILL

     (shrugging)
     Breaking and entering?

     KINSEY
     Jack...

     O'NEILL
     Sshh...It's ringing.

   [Kinsey reaches around and pulls out the phone cord.]

     KINSEY
     Now you can listen to what I have to say.

   [O'Neill reaches into pocket, pulls out his cell phone and again begins
   to dial. Kinsey reacts impatiently.]

     KINSEY
     Oh, for God's sake! You need to start trusting me, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Mmm...no, I really don't.

     KINSEY

     (adamant)
     Yes, you really do. The fate of the planet depends on it.

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--JACK O'NEILL'S LIVING ROOM, DAY

     O'NEILL

     (into the phone)
     Andy? It's Jack.

     ANDY
     Hey, what's up?

   [O'Neill hesitates]

     ANDY
     Jack? Hello?

     O'NEILL
     I was just checking on Friday, making sure we were still on for
     poker.

     ANDY
     Yeah, you bet.

     O'NEILL
     I'll bring the beer.

     ANDY
     Alright.

     O'NEILL
     See you then.

   [O'Neill hangs up the phone.]

     KINSEY
     Wise decision.

   [O'Neill sits down on the couch, making a point of looking at his
   watch.]

     O'NEILL
     You've got three minutes. Before I shoot you as an intruder in my
     home.

     KINSEY

     (laughing)
     Same old Jack O'Neill. Although I hear you're a general now.
     Congratulations.

   [O'Neill taps the watch with his gun.]

     KINSEY
     Alright, then. Straight to the point. You want to take down the
     Trust. I can help you.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastic)
     I'm sorry. I must have missed an episode. I thought you guys were
     working together?

     KINSEY
     After I was forced to resign as Vice President, my relationship with
     the organisation changed.

     O'NEILL
     Meaning, you were no longer useful so they kicked you out on your
     ass.

     KINSEY
     That's a rather crude way of putting it, but...yes.

     O'NEILL
     Why didn't they just shoot you?

     KINSEY
     Believe me, that was a consideration. Which is why, when they
     requested a meeting a few days ago, I suggested a nice, public
     venue. They made a very interesting offer.

   [O'Neill waves his pistol encouragingly, urging Kinsey to go on.]

     KINSEY
     In exchange for a large cash payment, the Trust wants me to arrange
     a meeting with General Miroslav Kiselev, the Russian defence
     minister.

     O'NEILL
     I thought they already had connections with the Russian military?

     KINSEY

     This isn't just a connection. Kiselev exercises operational
     authority over all of Russia's armed forces, including
     (he emphasises)
     their nuclear arsenal.

     O'NEILL
     And he just happens to be a good friend of yours.

     KINSEY

     (chortling)
     After the fall of Communism, he was one of a number of officers
     assigned to secret talks with the West aimed at military
     co-operation. He was a hard-liner even then. His country was falling
     apart, but he came at us as though we were the ones at a
     disadvantage. He and I developed a mutual respect.

     O'NEILL
     What does the Trust want with him?

     KINSEY
     Well, they wouldn't give me any specifics, but they know we entered
     into a deal with the Russians for control of the gate. And they also
     know that there's a growing sentiment in Moscow that we haven't been
     keeping up our end of the bargain.

     O'NEILL
     You think they're trying to turn the Russians against us?

     KINSEY
     It's ambitious, I know, even for the Trust, but from what I hear,
     after you put a crimp in their little plan to use symbiote poison to
     wipe out the Goa'uld, there's been a change of attitude. They're no
     longer willing to stay in the shadows and bide their time. They want
     to make a direct grab for power. And that's why I came to you.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastic)
     Yes, you've always struck me as the hero type.

   [Aggravated, Kinsey bounds to his feet, whisky glass in hand, pacing
   before O'Neill.]

     KINSEY

     (earnest)
     You may question my methods, but everything I did was for God and
     country. For the Trust to ally themselves with a foreign power
     against the United States of America, well, that's just something I
     can't condone.

     O'NEILL
     Kinsey, please! Spare me the diatribe. They kicked you when you were
     down and you want revenge. It's as simple as that.

     KINSEY
     The truth is, my motives are irrelevant. The Trust has become an
     imminent threat to the sovereignty of this nation. Now. What are you
     gonna do about it?

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER
     ...the Russians to back out of our deal?

     DANIEL
     Well, it would be a problem. Technically, the gate's only here on
     loan. If the Russians decide they want it back, things could get
     sticky.

     TEAL'C
     Is it possible Kinsey is simply lying?

     O'NEILL

     (emphatic)
     That is always possible.

     CARTER
     Has he asked for anything in return for the information?

     O'NEILL
     Protection.

     DANIEL
     Makes sense. If he doesn't co-operate, the Trust will kill him.

     CARTER
     Maybe he should co-operate. This could be our chance to get somebody
     on the inside. Infiltrate the organisation.

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c look deeply sceptical.]

   INT--SGC QUARTERS

     KINSEY

     (irate)
     You want me to wear a wire!

     O'NEILL
     That's the deal.

     KINSEY
     I am not a spy!

     O'NEILL
     Think of it this way. If you don't do what they want, they'll kill
     you. If you don't do what we want, we'll let 'em.

     KINSEY

     (shocked)
     Why, that's as good as pulling the trigger yourself! I thought
     Stargate Command didn't do that sort of thing.

     O'NEILL
     We...ell, we're under new management.

   [Kinsey fumes.]

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

     CARTER
     Alright. Let's test it. (Carter's face appears on a monitor) How's
     it looking?

     DANIEL
     Got picture.

     CARTER

     (to Kinsey)
     Let's have your belt.

     KINSEY
     Why?

     CARTER
     Because you'll be wearing this one instead.

   [Kinsey gets up and grudgingly begins to pull off his belt. Daniel sits
   at a console behind Kinsey.]

     CARTER
     The buckle contains a GPS receiver unit that'll allow us to track
     your movements.

     KINSEY

     (Hands Carter the belt)
     When we're done, I want that back.

     CARTER
     They've arranged to meet you at a remote location. My guess is that
     they'll make you leave your car while they drive you to a second
     location where the actual meeting will take place. And we're gonna
     have to keep back a fair distance, so as not to arouse suspicion.
     But, we will be monitoring your conversations by means of this
     listening device that we've fitted into the collar of your shirt.

   [Daniel looks at Carter's face in the monitor]

     CARTER
     We've got a strike team with us. They will be ready to move in at
     the first time of trouble. Now, in the event that something does go
     wrong, I suggest that we come up with a pre-established signal,
     preferably a code word, that'll let us know you're in trouble.

     KINSEY

     How about something simple, like
     (sarcastic)
     help?

     CARTER

     (smiling through gritted teeth)
     How about something a little less
     (sarcastic)
     obvious? Like...red.

     KINSEY
     What ever.

     CARTER
     Don't be too direct, fishing for information. Let them do the
     talking.

     KINSEY

     Get out of my way!
     (barges past Carter)
     I know what to do!

   EXT--KINSEY'S CAR, DAY

   [Kinsey's car is parked on a narrow road, isolated and surrounded by
   corn fields. Kinsey leans against the hood, extremely impatient as he
   consults his watch. A car pulls up beside him and a Trust henchman gets
   out of it.]

     KINSEY
     You're late.

   [Kinsey walks over to the car. The man holds up a blindfold.]

     KINSEY
     You're kidding, right?

     JENNINGS
     Afraid not.

   [Jennings places the blindfold over Kinsey's eyes and helps him get
   into the back of the car. They immediately drive away. The surveillance
   van follows. ]

     CARTER

     (voice heard on radio)
     It's on the move.

     TEAL'C
     Understood.

   [His SUV follows the surveillance truck.]

   [Inside the surveillance truck, Daniel and Carter watch events unfold
   on their monitors courtesy of Kinsey's hidden camera.]

     KINSEY
     So how long is this sight-seeing trip gonna last?

     JENNINGS
     We'll let you know.

   [Daniel and Carter continue to monitor as Kinsey is driven towards his
   secret destination.]

   INT--SURVEILLANCE TRUCK, DAY

     DANIEL
     Turned off the main road.

   [The truck and jeep turn off to follow the car down a side-road, still
   keeping a discreet distance. The car Kinsey is being transported in
   pulls up outside an imposing mock-Tudor mansion.]

     DANIEL
     They've stopped.

   [The truck and jeep pull up on the side-road, some distance away from
   the house as the monitor shows Kinsey's exit from the car. Jennings is
   seen at the front door of the house.]

     JENNINGS

     (to Kinsey)
     This way.

   INT--MANSION HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

   [Kinsey is led into the panelled entrance hall of the mansion, fumbling
   at the furniture for balance. His blindfold is removed.]

     MR. PARKER

     (Serving himself from the drinks cabinet)
     Bob. Good to see you again. Sorry about the blindfold.

   [Mr. Wayne is seated and smoking, watching Kinsey.]

     MR. PARKER
     What can we get you to drink?

     KINSEY
     What're you having?

     MR. PARKER
     Vodka tonic.

     KINSEY
     In that case, I'll have a scotch. No ice.

     MR. KENT

     (Walking down the stairs)
     We're glad you finally agreed to a private meeting. We were afraid
     you might be holding a grudge against us.

     KINSEY
     You mean because you abandoned me at the moment I needed you the
     most?

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

   [Daniel and Carter watch the monitors.]

     MR. PARKER
     You were a liability, Bob. An embarrassment.

   INT--MANSION HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

     KINSEY
     I think you've got that backwards. I was only forced to resign as
     Vice President because they found out about my relationship with
     you.

     MR. PARKER
     Either way, you were no longer useful to us. You would've done the
     same.

     KINSEY

     (snorts)
     Maybe. But when I cut someone loose, I don't go back to them,
     grovelling for favours.

     MR. WAYNE
     You say what's on your mind, I'll give you that.

     KINSEY

     Under other circumstances, I might be worried about winding up like
     one of your trophies on the wall
     (pointing)
     but you've already made it clear that you need me, so I don't have
     anything to worry about, do I?

   [He takes a drink.]

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

     CARTER
     We're losing video.

   [Carter attempts to adjust the monitor.]

     MR. KENT
     It's true we do need you, but not for what you think.

     DANIEL
     They're jamming us?

     CARTER
     I don't know.

   INT--MANSION HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

     KINSEY

     (suspicious)
     What are you talking about?

     MR. WAYNE

     (to henchman)
     Show him.

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

   [Daniel and Carter anxiously attempt to regain contact with Kinsey.]

   INT--MANSION HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

   [Jennings carries a metal box over to the table. He places it carefully
   down and opens it while Kinsey looks on. Then he turns it towards
   Kinsey.]

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

   [Daniel attempts to adjust a technical readout on his monitor.]

     MR. KENT
     This is why we need you.

   INT--MANSION HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

   [Kinsey, looking into the box, reacts with fear and horror.]

     KINSEY

     (horrified)
     What the hell is going on here!

   INT--SURVEILLANCE VAN, DAY

   [Daniel and Carter cringe, clapping their hands to their ears as the
   sound signal is cut off with a screech.]

     CARTER
     They're definitely jamming us. (activates her radio) Teal'c, we've
     lost audio. Move in!

   [Teal'c's SUV pulls out and races off, the truck immediately behind
   it.]

     DANIEL
     Can you get the signal back?

     CARTER
     I can't get past the interference.

   [The SUV pulls up with a squeal of tires outside the mansion house.
   Teal'c and the strike team emerge while Daniel and Carter prepare to
   join them. The team pour into the entrance hall.]

     STRIKE TEAM MEMBER
     Clear!

   [Carter picks up the glass that Kinsey was drinking from while Daniel
   is picking up the still warm and smoking cigar that Mr. Wayne was
   enjoying.]

     DANIEL

     (resigned)
     They beamed out.

     CARTER
     This is starting to become a habit.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

     CARTER
     If the Al'kesh is in orbit...

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER
     ...they must have fixed the cloak, because SSN hasn't picked them
     up.

     DANIEL
     Even with the locator beacons?

     CARTER
     We're running a search through the NSA satellite system, but all
     they'd have to do to avoid detection is change the frequency. Odds
     are, we're not gonna find anything.

     O'NEILL
     Well, the Pentagon's been apprised of the situation. They're
     launching Prometheus in about four hours. (pointing to Teal'c.) I
     want you on board.

   [Daniel looks around at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     There's a C-17 waiting for you at Peterson.

     TEAL'C

     (bowing his head in acknowledgment)
     Understood.

   [Teal'c gets up and leaves immediately.]

     CARTER
     Sir, I've been going over the sensor logs of the last encounter
     between Prometheus and the Al'kesh. There were a few small anomalies
     from the ship's position before it de-cloaked. They didn't register,
     because we didn't know to look for them but I could create a program
     that would key the sensors to those particular readings.

     O'NEILL
     I was just going to suggest that.

     DANIEL
     So we'd be able to detect a cloaked ship?

     CARTER
     Well, it's not that simple. These anomalies are very difficult to
     detect. It might've just been a fluke that we picked them up the
     first time. The effect is also mimicked by certain types of cosmic
     radiation. But I still think it might improve our odds.

     O'NEILL
     So, instead of a million to one?

     CARTER
     Maybe ten thousand to one?

   [O'Neill looks to Daniel questioningly.]

     DANIEL

     (encouragingly)
     Improvement.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     CARTER
     I'll need a few hours to create the program.

     O'NEILL
     Fine.

   [Carter gathers up her files and briskly exits. Appearing slightly
   lost, Daniel glances around the empty briefing room, then at O'Neill,
   who is looking at his paperwork.]

     DANIEL
     And I have to pick up my dry-cleaning.

   [He starts to get up.]

     O'NEILL
     You're on a flight to Moscow in half an hour.

   [Daniel sits back down, surprised.]

     DANIEL
     I am?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, you are. Colonel Chekov's people will meet you there. Will you
     please try to find out what the hell's going on? And if you get the
     chance, hook up with this General Kiselev.

     DANIEL
     Jack, they know that we're on to them. They may just abort the
     mission.

     O'NEILL
     Nah, the way Kinsey was talking, it sounds like they're looking for
     a big score here.

     DANIEL
     And...what if he won't cooperate with them?

     O'NEILL
     Kinsey'll do what's best for Kinsey.

     DANIEL
     Mmm.

   [Daniel gets up and leaves. O'Neill sits back and rubs both hands over
   his face, seeming tired.]

   EXT--PROMETHEUS, SPACE

   [Prometheus is orbiting Earth.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

   [The crew are bustling, preparing Prometheus for the mission.]

     COMM OFFICER
     Sir, download is complete. Colonel Carter's new sensor program is
     online and operational.

     COLONEL PENDERGAST
     Alright, begin Search Pattern Alpha.

     COMM OFFICER
     Yes, Sir.

   EXT--KREMLIN IN MOSCOW, DAY

   INT--KREMLIN, DAY

   [Daniel walks down a hallway and into an office. A female officer in
   Russian uniform is pulling files from a cabinet.]

     DANIEL

     (puzzled)
     Uh, hi. I'm here to see Captain Voronkov?

     CAPTAIN
     There is no Captain Voronkov here.

     DANIEL
     Oh! That's strange. The, er, the guy down the hall said...

     CAPTAIN

     (walking forward, smiling)
     I am Captain Voronkova.
     (shakes Daniel's hand)
     Daria Voronkova. You must be Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL

     (apologetic)
     Yeah. I'm sorry, I was told I'd be meeting Colonel Chekov's 'right
     hand man,' so naturally, I...

     VORONKOVA
     For my part, I expected a drab, pasty-faced, middle-aged academic. I
     too am pleasantly surprised.

   [Voronkova walks away, leaving Daniel confused and taken aback by the
   compliment.]

     DANIEL

     Oh!
     (he follows)
     Um, your English is excellent.

     VORONKOVA

     (in Russian)
     Thank you.
     (in English)
     And how is your Russian?

     DANIEL

     (in fluent Russian)
     Although I don't get the opportunity to practice much, I'm
     conversational. I suppose I can get by.
     (smiling)

     VORONKOVA
     Okay, we stick to English then.

   [Daniel's smile vanishes and he looks hurt.]

     VORONKOVA
     I will be your guide. Whatever you wish to do in Moscow, you will
     ask me first. I will take care of it. If you desire to meet with
     anyone, I will arrange it for you. If you go out on your own, I
     cannot protect you. Lie to me, or attempt to mislead me, and I will
     not protect you.

     DANIEL

     (businesslike)
     Okay.

   [Voronkova eyes Daniel appreciatively.]

     VORNKOVA
     Have you eaten a proper lunch?

     DANIEL
     I had something on the plane.

     VORONKOVA
     Then the answer is no. Good.

   [Daniel blinks at this brisk contradiction.]

     VORONKOVA
     I know a restaurant around the corner that serves the best Salo in
     Moscow.

     DANIEL
     Oh, I'm not a big fan of Salo.

     VORONKOVA
     Don't worry, you will acquire taste.

   [She strolls confidently out and Daniel has no choice but to follow.]

   INT--SGC HALLWAY

   [O'Neill is striding down a corridor while an alarm sounds. Carter runs
   up behind him.]

     CARTER
     Sir, what's going on?

     O'NEILL
     The Russians have gone to a heightened state of alert.

     CARTER

     (surprised)
     Why?

     O'NEILL
     We're trying to find out. President's called a meeting for the Joint
     Chiefs. We're at DEFCON 3.

   [Perturbed, Carter follows O'Neill into the control room.]

   EXT--RUSSIAN COUNTRYSIDE, DAY

   [A military jeep drives through narrow, winding roads.]

     DANIEL
     So. Where exactly are we going?

     VORONKOVA

     You wished to meet with General Kiselev, da?
     (Daniel nods)
     That is where we are going.

     DANIEL

     You must be pretty well connected to get me in to see him this
     quickly.
     (smiling)
     What do you know about him?

     VORONKOVA
     General Miroslav Kiselev. Graduated with a Gold Medal from
     Malinovsky Tank Academy, received the Hero Of Russia for his
     distinguished leadership in Chechnya, commanded the Carpathian
     military district for IM Division, then the 14th Army in the
     Astrakhan military district. He was the head of the General Staff
     Academy for five years before being appointed to his present
     position.

     DANIEL

     (a little snarky)
     So you've heard of him?

     VORONKOVA
     He's always suspicious of American influence and highly critical of
     what he calls 'NATO expansion plans.' You may not receive a very
     warm welcome.

   [Voronkova steers the jeep around some hairpin bends, into a military
   blockade, trucks and armed soldiers sealing off the road ahead.
   Voronkova swears and slams on the brakes. The soldiers quickly surround
   the jeep. Voronkova and Daniel get out of the jeep, Daniel waiting as
   Voronkova approaches the officer in charge. She salutes and greets
   him.]

     VORONKOVA

     (in Russian)
     Colonel Chernovshev.

     COLONEL CHERNOVSHEV

     (in Russian)
     Is that the American who wishes to see General Kiselev?

     VORONKOVA
     Yes.

     CHERNOVSHEV

     He is to be held for questioning.
     (to the soldiers)
     Take him.

   [Two soldiers seize Daniel and begin to pull him towards the truck.]

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

     VORONKOVA

     I don't know.
     (turns to Chernovshev, speaking now in Russian)
     Sir, may I ask what this is about?

     CHERNOVSHEV

     (in Russian)
     No.
     (turns away)

     VORONKOVA
     Don't worry, Daniel. I'll find out what's happening.

   [Crowded by soldiers, Daniel climbs onto the truck, refusing the hand
   extended by a waiting soldier. Grim-faced, he sits as the soldiers
   climb in and surround him.]

   INT--SGC, O'NEILL'S OFFICE

   [Sgt. Harriman hovers at the doorway to O'Neill's office.]

     O'NEILL

     (into phone)
     Alright.
     (indicates Harriman should wait)
     Get back to me when you know something.

   [He hangs up.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, Colonel Chekov's here to see you.

     O'NEILL
     Send him in.

   [Harriman leaves and Colonel Chekov enters O'Neill's office.]

     CHEKOV
     General.

     O'NEILL
     Colonel! I was hoping you could shed some light on the situation
     here.

   [Chekov takes a seat.]

     O'NEILL
     We can't seem to get a straight answer from your government.

     CHEKOV
     The information coming out of Moscow is guarded at best but my
     sources in the Kremlin tell me the Russian military is increasing
     its alert status because they think the American administration has
     been compromised.

   INT--DINING ROOM, UNKNOWN RUSSIAN RESIDENCE, DAY

   [In his shirtsleeves, Daniel sits at a dining table in an elegant room.
   A soldier stands guard behind him as Colonel Chernovshev enters,
   accompanied by a medical doctor.]

     CHERNOVSHEV
     Doctor Jackson, sorry to keep you waiting.

     DANIEL
     No problem. You wanna tell me what's going on?

     CHERNOVSHEV

     (standing over Daniel)
     All in good time. Please, roll up your sleeve.

   [Daniel stares up at him.]

     CHERNOVSHEV
     We need a sample of your blood.

   [The doctor approaches Daniel, a hypodermic syringe ready in his hands.
   Daniel looks in concern from the colonel to the doctor.]

     DANIEL
     You're kidding?

     CHERNOVSHEV
     Either you cooperate or we will take it by force.

   [Daniel glances warily at the armed guard behind him, calculates his
   odds, sighs and rolls up his sleeve.]

     DANIEL

     (pissed)
     Is this a normal part of your interrogation procedure?

     CHERNOVSHEV
     It depends what you wish to know.

   [The doctor prepares to take his sample of Daniel's blood.]

     CHERNOVSHEV
     In this case, it will answer a very specific question.

     DANIEL

     (eyeing the doctor)
     What question? OW!

   [He glares as his blood is taken.]

     CHERNOVSHEV

     (to the doctor)
     (in Russian)
     Have it analysed immediately.

   [The doctor hurries out.]

     DANIEL

     (grim)
     What's going on?

     CHERNOVSHEV
     Why do you wish to see General Kiselev?

     DANIEL

     (sighs)
     It's complicated.

     CHERNOVSHEV
     Well, surely you can explain it to me?

     DANIEL
     I think I'd rather explain it to General Kiselev.

     CHERNOVSHEV
     That's not going to happen. You see, earlier today we managed to
     uncover a plot against the General's life. Luckily, we captured the
     assassin before he could make his move.

   [Chernovshev goes over to a TV and picks up a remote control.]

     CHERNOVSHEV
     I believe you know him?

   [The screen shows Kinsey, dressed in a beige prison uniform, seated
   alone in a cell. His wrists are chained to his waist, restricting his
   movement.]

     DANIEL
     Kinsey!

     CHERNOVSHEV
     Robert Kinsey, former Vice President of the United States of
     America.

     DANIEL
     It's insane. Why would Kinsey want to kill General Kiselev?

     CHERNOVSHEV

     I'm afraid Mr. Kinsey isn't exactly himself these days.
     (uses the remote control to activate sound.)

     KINSEY

     (speaking with the distinctive metallic timbre of the Goa'uld)
     By stopping me, you have only delayed the inevitable.
     (his eyes glow)
     Your world is doomed.

     CHERNOVSHEV

     (staring at Daniel)
     Now you begin to appreciate the gravity of the situation.

   [Daniel is stunned.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

     CHEKOV
     How could Kinsey have become a Goa'uld?

   INT--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM

   [The operations room is small, crowded with computer consoles and
   complex displays on screens and monitors, including a map of the
   Earth.]

     O'NEILL
     Five bucks says Carter has a theory.

     CARTER

     (pushes away from her desk and stands up)
     As a matter of fact, I do.
     (goes over to Chekov and O'Neill)
     According to Tok'ra intelligence, the Trust launched at least two
     attacks against Goa'uld occupied worlds after we took back the gate.
     That means they had to leave the relatively safe confines of the
     solar system and head out into the galaxy where they ran the risk of
     being killed or...captured.

     CHEKOV
     What are you suggesting?

     CARTER
     Any Goa'uld who got his hands on them would've discovered pretty
     quickly that they belonged to a top secret organisation with
     high-level connections to some of the most powerful governments and
     institutions on this planet, including the SGC, Area 51 and maybe
     even the Ancient outpost in the Antarctic.

     CHEKOV
     My God. You think they have been taken as hosts and then sent back
     to Earth.

     CARTER
     I think it's possible. They could have brought dozens, maybe even
     hundreds of symbiotes back with them. By now, the entire Trust could
     have been taken over.

     CHEKOV
     But why would the Goa'uld want to assassinate General Kiselev?

     O'NEILL
     We don't know for sure that was the plan, but if Carter's right,
     Kinsey might have been trying to get a snake into Kiselev's head.

     CARTER
     It makes sense. From Kiselev, it's one step up to the President of
     Russia.

     CHEKOV
     How do we know he didn't succeed?

     CARTER
     Kinsey never met with the general. He was arrested before he had the
     chance.

     CHEKOV
     Well, my government feels that it is the American administration
     that has been infiltrated by the...

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     Oh, here we go.

     CHEKOV
     ...Goa'uld and they are insisting that everyone in key positions,
     including the President, must submit for testing.

     O'NEILL

     (looks Chekov up and down)
     Not gonna happen.

     CHEKOV
     Well. Then we have a problem.

   [O'Neill and Carter exchange concerned looks.]

   INT--KREMLIN, VORONKOVA'S OFFICE

   [Captain Voronkova and Daniel enter the office.]

     DANIEL
     Thank you for getting me out of there.

     VORONKOVA

     It wasn't easy.
     (they go over and sit at the desk)
     Even after your blood test came back negative, they still wanted to
     hold you.

     DANIEL

     Yeah. Not a lot of trust and goodwill to spare right now, I guess.
     (serious)
     Listen, I need to talk to the Goa'uld.

     VORONKOVA
     Nyet.

     DANIEL
     You have to get me in to see Kinsey.

     VORONKOVA
     Impossible.

     DANIEL

     (earnest)
     If we're going to figure out what's going on here, we have to
     question him.

     VORONKOVA
     He is being questioned. By Russian military intelligence.

     DANIEL

     (impassioned)
     Yes, and he's feeding them a pack of lies. He's telling them the
     American administration has been compromised because he wants to
     force a confrontation.

     VORNKOVA
     To what end?

     DANIEL
     I don't know! That's why we need to talk to him.

     VORONKOVA
     Dosta!

     DANIEL

     (frowning disapprovingly)
     Language!

   [Voronkova is deeply reluctant, shooting Daniel a stony look.]

     DANIEL

     (pleading)
     Daria, please.

     VORONKOVA

     (sighing heavily)
     I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, stay here.

   [Voronkova goes out of the office, leaving Daniel alone and pensive.]

   INT--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM

   [The SGC is at DEFCON 3 status. Sgt. Harriman comes into the operations
   room and approaches O'Neill, who is reading a report.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, just received another report. As of 0912, the Chinese military
     have joined the Russians in a heightened state of alert.

     O'NEILL

     (withering)
     Naturally.

   [Harriman leaves as O'Neill turns, attention focused on his reports.]

     CHEKOV
     General. I've been talking to my contacts in the Kremlin. They tell
     me President Mikailhov is not happy with the situation but is under
     considerable pressure from his military advisers.

     O'NEILL
     In other words, Kiselev is running the show.

     CHEKOV

     (nods)
     Da.

     O'NEILL

     (leads the way across the operations room, Chekov following)
     Any idea how we can keep this from going to total forces?

     CHEKOV
     Yes. I have many friends in the general's staff. If I can convince
     enough of them to take a united stand against escalation, it could
     give our President sufficient leverage to consider other options.

     O'NEILL
     And if Kiselev finds out you're going around him, it could make
     things...worse.

     CHEKOV
     At this point, I don't believe we have much choice.

     O'NEILL

     (grave)
     Right.

   INT--RUSSIAN DETENTION CELL, DAY

   [Kinsey is chained and restless, glaring around him at his bleak, small
   concrete-walled cell, the windows high above him. The cell door opens;
   Captain Voronkova and Daniel enter the cell.]

     VORONKOVA

     (to the guard, in Russian)
     Thank you. We'll call you when we need you.

   [Hands in his pockets, Daniel walks slowly forward, staring down into
   the Goa'uld's face. He flashes a brief, humourless smile.]

     DANIEL
     So what should I call you?

     KINSEY
     You are unworthy to speak my name.

     DANIEL
     Maybe. So I'm guessing you work for the System Lords, am I right?

   [Kinsey looks down at his cuffed wrists.]

     DANIEL
     I know you're not working for Ba'al. He's too busy conquering the
     galaxy to bother with an unimportant planet like Earth. Gotta hand
     it to you, though, your territories are falling one by one, your
     troops are in full retreat and you still find the time to come
     destroy little old us. Question is...why?

   [He and Kinsey make eye contact.]

     DANIEL
     Captain Voronkova thinks it's a need for revenge for all the trouble
     we've caused you over the years. Sort of a last ditch attempt to
     take us with you before Baal finishes you off. I told her the System
     Lords aren't that pathetic. Are they?

     KINSEY
     You are the one who is pathetic. You will die never knowing our true
     purpose.

     DANIEL
     So there is a hidden agenda.

   [The Goa'uld looks away, trying to hide its reaction from Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Making progress now, aren't we?

   INT--SGC, O'NEILL'S OFFICE

   [Chekov comes into O'Neill's office. O'Neill is on the phone.]

     O'NEILL

     (into phone)
     Yeah. Alright, keep me posted.

   [He hangs up and stands, coming around from behind the desk to confront
   Chekov.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, the Chinese are refusing to back down and, gosh and golly, go
     figure, we're pickin' up increased chatter from within Russia.

     CHEKOV
     I'm still waiting to hear back from my contacts in Moscow.

     O'NEILL

     And I just talked to the Joint Chiefs.
     (He starts to walk out of the room.)
     We're goin' to DEFCON 2.

   [Chekov hesitates, looking worried.]

   INT--RUSSIAN DETENTION CELL, DAY

     DANIEL

     (pacing)
     You know, I'm sure if we put our heads together, we'd come up with a
     dozen reasons why you'd want to wipe us out. Most important being
     the Ancient weapon that you know we possess. I'm sure the System
     Lords think that if they can get us to wipe ourselves out, they can
     just step in and take it, but what I don't understand is you. Why
     are you willing to sacrifice yourself?

     KINSEY

     (glaring up at Daniel)
     I assure you, I have no intention of dying on this miserable planet.

     DANIEL

     (watching intently)
     You're in Russian defence headquarters. Premiere target. If you do
     succeed in starting a nuclear war, you're gonna die right along with
     the rest of us.

   [The Goa'uld smirks confidently.]

     DANIEL

     (begins to smile)
     Unless there's something I'm missing?

     KINSEY

     You should return to your homes and say farewell to your loved ones.
     Your gods have deemed you to be unworthy.
     (smiling)
     The hour of reckoning is at hand.

     Air Force Space Command has put all its missile wings on alert. The

     action message. Nine of our missile submarines are at sea and the
     rest are preparing for immediate sortie. The President and his team
     are on their way to Andrews, where...

   the operations room and heads over to them.]

     HARRIMAN
     ...the National Airborne Command Post is awaiting their arrival.

   [He notices O'Neill has wandered away and looks annoyed.]

     CHEKOV

     General Kiselev found out we were trying to rally support against
     him. He's already arrested several officers on trumped up charges.
     I'm afraid Dr. Jackson may be in danger.

     from the shadows)
     Next to slaughtering innocents, gloating is what you guys are all
     about. Must be...killing you, just sitting there not bragging about
     your brilliant plan.

   [Voronkova's pager activates. She checks it.]

     VORONKOVA
     We have to get out of here now.

     DANIEL
     Why? What is it?

     VORONKOVA
     They're coming for us.

     DANIEL
     Who?

   [Voronkova turns as a voice sounds from outside the cell.]

     RUSSIAN SOLDIER

     (in Russian)
     Step aside! We are under orders from General Kiselev.

   [As the cell door is unlocked, Voronkova darts across to block the
   doorway, holding up a cautioning hand to Daniel.]

     KINSEY

     (stands)
     You are too late.

   [Voronkova argues in Russian with the commandoes who enter the cell.
   Behind the Goa'uld, Daniel reaches into his jacket for a device which
   he immediately activates. A rapid, high-pitched beep sounds. The
   Russians raise their weapons and Voronkova intervenes while Daniel puts
   his hand on Kinsey's shoulder.]

     DANIEL
     Sorry, guys. Gotta go.

   [Daniel and Kinsey are surrounded by a beam of intense white light. The
   soldiers fire as they dematerialise. The Russian commandoes and
   Voronkova react in shock as they disappear from the cell.]

   Teal'c is waiting nearby and steps forward, activating a zat gun.]

     (shaking hands with Daniel)
     Dr. Jackson, welcome aboard the Prometheus.

     DANIEL
     Any luck finding the Al'kesh?

     TEAL'C
     None.

     PENDERGAST

     (looking at the Goa'uld)
     Maybe he can help us.

     KINSEY

     (eyes them calculatingly)
     I think not.

     TEAL'C

     (steely)
     If you do not cooperate, I will kill you.

     KINSEY
     Don't you realise what you have done? The Russians already suspect
     that you have been compromised by the Goa'uld. As far as they know,
     you helped me to escape.

   [Teal'c is deeply dismayed.]

     KINSEY

     (gloating)
     You have done more to convince them than I ever could.

   [Daniel stiffens up, perturbed and doubtful.]

     Listen up, people. I just got word. The Russians have gone to a full
     state of military preparedness. As of this moment, we're at DEFCON

   Colonel Chekov despairing.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE, SPACE

     KINSEY

     (to Daniel and Pendergast)
     The Russians will no doubt view my abduction as an attempt to hide
     evidence that your government has been infiltrated by the Goa'uld.
     You have no choice but to return me immediately.

     DANIEL

     (confrontational and suspicious)
     Yeah. See, that's the part I don't understand. The whole time that
     you were down there, you were doing your best to start a nuclear war
     even though you were right in the line of fire. Now you want to go
     back?

     PENDERGAST
     He has a way out.

     DANIEL
     He has someone on the inside, someone who can protect him.

     TEAL'C

     (stepping forward, aiming the zat at the Goa'uld)
     Who is it?

     KINSEY
     I have nothing more to say to you.

     We can start this again, when he's had some time to think about it.

     All our naval forces have been deployed and...we've got some pretty
     big birds in the air right now.

   [Chekov and O'Neill look extremely grave.]

     O'NEILL
     Radio chatter suggests that both your people and the Chinese have
     alerted their missile regiments.

     CHEKOV

     (earnest)
     They're posturing. Kiselev knows that even if he launches an
     effective first strike against your land-based forces, your
     sea-based missiles are already in a position to exact extreme
     retribution.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, that's only if he doesn't completely lose his mind. And I'm
     not discounting that possibility.

     CHEKOV
     As Acting Commander-In-Chief of the Russian armed forces, President
     Mikailhov is our only hope of reeling him in.

     O'NEILL

     (impatient)
     Well, we can't get through to him! He's not even taking calls from
     the White House anymore.

     CHEKOV

     He is convinced the Goa'uld now control the American administration.
     (sighs heavily, holding up a conciliatory hand)
     Look. I know a few people on his personal staff.
     (he and O'Neill stop, facing one another)
     I may be able to get a direct line. But, if we do make contact, we
     will only have a few minutes to convince him that General Kiselev
     has been misled by the Goa'uld. Now, right now, I don't see how
     we're going to do that.

     Very well. Destroy the ship.

     JENNINGS
     They have superior shields. If we do not succeed with the first
     salvo, we will be at a disadvantage.

     O'NEILL
     Please! Tell me you have...something!

   [Carter steps away from the lab table, clutching a report.]

     CARTER

     Yes, Sir. I think I do. I've been going over everything we have on
     General Kiselev and I found this.
     (turns around her file and hands it to O'Neill who sees a personnel
     report)
     Colonel Ruselin Chernovshev. He was Kiselev's Chief of Staff, his
     right-hand man. Three years ago, he was involved in a plot to sell a
     captured symbiote to elements of the Trust, then operating within
     the NID.
     (earnest)
     That means the Trust had a direct connection to Kiselev. They didn't
     need Kinsey. He was just a pretext to justify this confrontation by
     making them think that we'd been compromised.

     CHEKOV
     So, if the Trust had access to Kiselev, then he could have been
     compromised as well.

     CARTER

     Exactly.
     (turns to pick up a 2nd file)
     This is a file photo of General Kiselev taken three years ago.
     (hands O'Neill a black & white photo of Kiselev wearing glasses)
     And this was taken less than a week ago during a speech he gave at
     the General Staff Academy.
     (hands O'Neill a colour photo of Kiselev without glasses)
     Notice the difference?

     O'NEILL

     (comparing the photos side by side)
     Glasses.

   [Carter nods confirmation.]

     CHEKOV

     (to O'Neill)
     May I see that?

   [He takes the photos.]

     CARTER
     We know that symbiotes have healing power. They can cure a host body
     of any number of physical short-comings, including bad eyesight.

   [Chekov and O'Neill are sceptical.]

     O'NEILL

     (raising eyebrows)
     That's it?
     (Carter drops her head)
     Did it occur to you that he might be wearing contacts?

     CARTER

     (a little defensive)
     Sir, I realise it's not a lot to go on.

     O'NEILL

     (a little sarcastic)
     Have you heard of laser surgery?

   [Carter pulls a face, looking annoyed.]

     CARTER
     Sir...

     CHEKOV

     (interrupting)
     No, wait. Colonel Carter is right. General Kiselev suffered from
     glaucoma. His vision was extremely poor. There is no possibility he
     could have read from a prepared statement without his glasses.

     CARTER
     Sir, I think Kiselev's a Goa'uld. I think he has been all along.

   INT--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR, SPACE

   [Teal'c leads the way down a damaged hallway as Prometheus continues to
   reel from the Al'kesh attack. Reaching a corner, he and Daniel come
   under weapons fire from Kinsey. Teal'c returns fire with his zat, but
   Kinsey eludes them. Teal'c and Daniel--also armed with a zat--pursue
   him. They emerge through a closed compartment door into a new section
   of corridors, only to hear the rings activating in the distance.
   Proceeding cautiously into the ring room, they find it empty. Kinsey
   has escaped them.]

     DANIEL

     (gritting his teeth in anger)
     Crap!

   [Daniel and Teal'c leave at once to return to the bridge of
   Prometheus.]

   INT--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM

   [Harriman sits with another airman before a console and large tactical
   display.]

     HARRIMAN

     (to O'Neill)
     We've almost got it, Sir. Stand by.

     O'NEILL

     (to Chekov)
     Hey! How do we know Mikailhov hasn't been infected too?

     CHEKOV
     We don't. But at this point, we hardly have anything to lose.

     O'NEILL
     Good point.

     HARRIMAN

     (turning to O'Neill)
     We've got it, Sir. You're on.

     CHEKOV

     (activating comms)
     Mr. President? Can you hear me?

     MIKAILHOV

     (via comms)
     Colonel Chekov, this is highly irregular.

     CHEKOV

     (conciliating)
     Yes, Sir, but these are highly unusual circumstances.

     MIKAILHOV
     Agreed. Is General O'Neill there with you?

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     I'm here, Mr. President.

     MIKAILHOV
     It's good to speak with you again, although you understand that at
     the moment, I cannot trust anything you say.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, about that? It's true there has been a Goa'uld infiltration,
     but it's not on our side. It's on yours.

     MIKAILHOV

     (after a pause)
     What is it exactly that you are saying?

     O'NEILL
     Let me put it this way, Sir. The last time you saw General Kiselev,
     did you happen to notice if he was wearing his glasses?

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE, SPACE

   [Daniel and Teal'c return to Prometheus' bridge as the ship and its
   crew shudder from another assault by the Al'kesh.]

     COMM OFFICER
     Shields are holding, Sir. Forty per cent and steady.

     PENDERGAST
     Then we've got 'em. Come about and prepare to fire on my signal.

   [Daniel and Teal'c look on in concern.]

   INT--AL'KESH BRIDGE, SPACE

   [Jennings is working at the Al'kesh command console when he turns
   suddenly to find Kinsey standing quietly behind him, waiting.]

     JENNINGS
     I'm pleased you were able to use my diversion to free yourself.

     KINSEY

     (icy)
     Do you think I'm a fool? You tried to destroy the ship because you
     thought I would reveal information about you.

     JENNINGS

     (oily)
     Of course not. We were merely...

   [Kinsey calmly raises his weapon and fires several times, hitting
   Jennings in the chest. Jennings falls to the floor.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE, SPACE

     PENDERGAST
     Open fire. All batteries!

   [The COMM OFFICER activates her console.]

     COMM OFFICER

     (emphatic)
     Yes, Sir!

   INT--AL'KESH BRIDGE, SPACE

   [Kinsey staggers as the Al'kesh rocks from weapons fire by Prometheus.
   He stumbles towards the command console and Jennings' body, reaching
   out to strip the ribbon device from Jennings' hand.]

   INT--SGC, OPERATIONS ROOM

   [Carter sits by a fax machine in the hushed operations room. She nods
   to Colonel Chekov.]

     CHEKOV

     (into comms)
     We're sending you the relevant documents now, Mr. President. Proof
     of Colonel Chernoshev's prior relationship with the Trust. Plus a
     list of generals who will support you should you decide to move
     against General Kiselev.

     MIKAILHOV

     (via comms)
     I must say, I'm not sure what to make of all this.

     O'NEILL
     Well, you could start by trusting us.

     MIKAILHOV
     And if you have been compromised by the Goa'uld, I would be standing
     down my forces with the Americans in position to launch an immediate
     attack.

     O'NEILL

     (forceful, persuasive)
     We both know neither side can win outright with a first strike. And
     that's the whole point. The Goa'uld don't want a winner. They want
     us to destroy each other.

     MIKAILHOV
     Why?

     CHEKOV
     We believe their ultimate goal is to get their hands on the Ancient
     weapon in Antarctica.

     HARRIMAN

     (turns to report what he's hearing through channels)(serious)
     Sir, MPIC is reporting visuals from Russian missile site 537. Silo
     doors are open, evidence of a fire fight on the ground.

     CHEKOV

     (horrified)
     My God! Kiselev is trying to launch without authorisation!

     O'NEILL

     (deadly serious)
     Mr. President, you are about to lose control of your own forces. You
     have to do something right now!

   [President Mikailhov's comms signal breaks from interference.]

     O'NEILL

     (turning to Harriman)
     What happened?

     HARRIMAN

     (anxious)
     We lost the connection. The line is down.

   [O'Neill and Chekov exchange a worried look.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE, SPACE

     COMM OFFICER

     (reading from her console)
     Sir, the Al'kesh is no longer making evasive manoeuvres or returning
     fire. We have a clear shot.

     PENDERGAST
     Stand by.

   [Daniel and Teal'c brace themselves for the attack.]

   INT--AL'KESH BRIDGE, SPACE

   [Jennings' body lies slumped in the shadows on the bridge of the
   Al'Kesh as Mr. Parker, Mr. Wayne and Mr. Kent enter hurriedly.]

     MR. KENT

     (his voice has the metallic timber of the Goa'uld)
     Why are we not returning fire?

   [They see Jennings and rush over to him. Mr. Kent checks for Jennings'
   pulse, then immediately jumps up to begin activating controls on the
   command console of the Al'kesh. Mr. Parker works feverishly at the
   station next to him.]

   INT--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE, SPACE

     COMM OFFICER
     They're powering weapons.

     PENDERGAST
     Take 'em out.

   [Comm Officer looks up as Prometheus begins its strafing run and fires
   on the Al'kesh. The Goa'uld ship explodes, blinding Daniel, Teal'c and
   everyone on the bridge with brilliant light.]

     COMM OFFICER
     Target destroyed.

   [Pendergast reacts soberly to the report.]

   INT--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM

   [The airmen manning the consoles are silent and afraid. O'Neill sits
   alone, restless and edgy as he waits. Impatiently he stands, checks his
   watch, and then thinks for a moment in grave, stony silence. He's
   making a difficult decision.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Harriman)(calm and sober)
     Get me Washington.

   [Carter and Harriman react strongly to this decision, realising the
   implications of what O'Neill is about to do.]

     CHEKOV

     (anxious, pleading)(surges towards O'Neill)
     General! Wait!

     O'NEILL
     We're out of time, Colonel.

     CHEKOV

     (begging)
     Please.

   [O'Neill looks unhappy but resolute.]

     HARRIMAN

     (to O'Neill)(listening to comms channel)
     Sir! MPIC is reporting new visuals at 537. Silo doors are closing!

     CARTER

     (turns to O'Neill)(listening to comms channel)
     Russian bombers are turning around and returning to base.

   [Behind O'Neill, Chekov sighs gustily, slumping with relief at the near
   miss. O'Neill merely waits for confirmation.]

     CARTER
     They're standing down.

   [O'Neill nods quiet acknowledgement to Carter, his expression heavy.]
