   TEASER

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The alarm sounds for an unscheduled offworld activation and SGC Gate
   room security race to the Gate room and set up defensive positions.]

     OFF CAMERA SPEAKER--Possibly SGT DAVIS
     Unscheduled offworld activation.

     SGT DAVIS
     It's SG-1's ID, sir. Receiving audio, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     On speaker.

   [A radio signal comes through. We hear O'Neill's voice.]

     O'NEILL
     Close quarters withdrawal. It's going to get ugly.

     HAMMOND
     Acknowledged, Colonel. We'll be ready, just give us the word.

     HAMMOND

     (to Gate room troops)
     Watch your friendlies. Safeties off. Clean targets. Clean
     backgrounds.

   [O'Neill can still be heard as can the sound of blasting.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c! Let's go. Base, this is it! We're on our way.

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The iris is opened and staff blasts hit the control room window.
   O'Neill, Daniel and Carter race through the Gate.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c's right behind us!

   [A Jaffa comes through the Gate and is shot but manages to get off a
   shot at Teal'c with a staff weapon.]

     HAMMOND
     Clear!

   [Camera cuts to Teal'c as he slowly falls back. We see he's injured, a
   shot to the belly where Junior used to reside.]

     HAMMOND
     Med team, get in there!

     FRAISER

     Teal'c? (starts working to help Teal'c)
     Come on.

     MEDIC
     I'm not getting a pulse.

     FRAISER
     Start CPR. Give me 1 milligram of epi. Prepare to intubate.

   ROLL CREDITS

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

     FRAISER
     You had us all very worried.

     TEAL'C
     That was not my intention.

     FRAISER
     A staff blast hit you directly in the symbiote pouch. If you weren't
     on tretonin...

     TEAL'C
     I would be dead. Ironic.

     FRAISER
     Well, you're not out of the woods yet.

     TEAL'C
     What?

     FRAISER
     You have more healing to do. The staff blast passed through the
     empty symbiote pouch and did some damage to your spine and
     surrounding soft tissue. In the past I could have let your symbiote
     regenerate the damage. With work you should be able to make a full
     recovery. Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     The Jaffa that wounded me--?

     FRAISER
     Died. His symbiote was damaged beyond repair. Look. I know this is
     hard for you. But you're very lucky to be alive.

   INT--SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill planted my radio in the underbrush away from our
     position and began broadcasting to create a distraction. The Jaffa
     fell for this diversion and half of them left the temple. We engaged
     the rest and escaped.

     HAMMOND
     Were you able to ascertain who these Jaffa were loyal to?

     DANIEL
     Their forehead tattoos were of various System Lords but the majority
     bore the symbol of Ba'al.

     HAMMOND
     Ba'al?

     DANIEL
     His empire has expanded further and faster than anyone could have
     expected. Which shouldn't be a surprise to us since he now controls
     the combined forces of the United Alliance of the System Lords.
     Something we are responsible for.

     HAMMOND
     To level the playing field against Anubis.

     DANIEL
     So in a way we did it to ourselves.

   [Fraiser enters the room.]

     FRAISER
     Sir.

     HAMMOND
     How is he?

     FRAISER
     It's going be a long road back. Certainly longer than Teal'c is used
     to but he should get there. I've boosted his tretonin dosage to stem
     off any residual infection.

     CARTER
     Can we see him?

     FRAISER
     Yeah.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Daniel is at Teal'c's bedside.]

     DANIEL
     How's Rya'c?

     TEAL'C
     My son? Why do you ask?

     DANIEL
     Well, I don't know. I just thought you'd be sick of how are you
     feeling again.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     DANIEL
     No, I was just thinking about him recently.

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c is with Bra'tac. They are attempting to recruit rebel Jaffa. I
     have not heard from them and do not expect to for some time.

   [There are four pots of green jello, three empty--one with a spoon in
   it--still full, on a nearby table.]

     DANIEL
     What's with the--uh--?

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill. I believe his offer of coloured gelatin was his attempt to
     sympathise.

     DANIEL
     Oh, well, he's thoughtful that way.

     TEAL'C
     There is no need. I blame only myself.

     DANIEL
     How is it your fault?

     TEAL'C
     I fell behind. I was...

     DANIEL
     Covering us. Teal'c--!

     TEAL'C
     I wish to be alone, Daniel Jackson.

   [Teal'c turns his head away.]

     DANIEL

     Okay. (hurt and reluctantly getting up)
     Okay.

   [Daniel leaves the room. Outside he pulls up when walks he hears a male
   voice calling out, sounding distressed. He turns to look back at Teal'c
   but Teal'c still has his head turned away.]

   INT--SGC GYM

   [Teal'c appears to be having physiotherapy while Daniel and Carter work
   out nearby.]

     CARTER
     So they fly halfway across the galaxy in a highly advanced
     spaceship, but they don't use their technology to take over the
     planet. You know what their weakness turned out to be? Water! I
     mean, if that's true, why go to all the trouble to invade a planet
     that's two-thirds water. Not to mention the rain.

     DANIEL
     Why do you watch those movies if all you're going to do is cut 'em
     up?

     CARTER
     Come on! Don't you occasionally like to see if they're getting it
     anywhere close to right?

   [Daniel seems distracted.]

     CARTER
     Hello?

     DANIEL
     What?

     CARTER

     (concerned)
     Are you okay?

     DANIEL
     Ever feel like you forgot something really important?

     CARTER
     What do you mean?

     DANIEL
     Well...I can remember almost everything from before I died but I
     still can't remember anything from when I was ascended. Something's
     been nagging at me. Something specific, I just can't pin it down.

   [Teal'c is a little apart from the others, doing his physio.]

     PHYSIOTHERAPIST
     Very good, Teal'c. Okay, you're done.

   [Teal'c continues with his exercise.]

     PHYSIOTHERAPIST
     Teal'c!

   [Teal'c will not stop. Carter and Daniel go over to them.]

     CARTER
     Looks like you're doing better.

     DANIEL
     You know there is such a thing as overdoing it.

   [Teal'c ignores them.]

     CARTER
     Yeah. Teal'c, it is possible to aggravate your condition by pushing
     too hard.

   [Teal'c falls forward and Daniel tries to help him, only to be
   forcefuly rebuffed.]

     TEAL'C

     (threatening)
     Leave me be!

   [Daniel hears the voice calling out again. Carter sees this and walks
   over to him, concerned.]

     CARTER
     Daniel?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is sat before a computer while Daniel sits beside her, looking
   on.]

     CARTER
     Any technical anomalies during an incoming wormhole are noted in
     this box and cross-referenced and detailed here. It's pretty dry.
     The corresponding mission files cover any general points of
     interest.

     DANIEL
     Yeah I've been over those.

     CARTER
     Well, if I knew what you were looking for--

     DANIEL
     We wouldn't be doing this.

     CARTER
     What makes you think the answers here?

     DANIEL
     I just have this feeling it has something to do with an incoming
     wormhole. I was hoping that looking at some of this stuff might jog
     my memory somehow.

     CARTER
     It must be tough.

     DANIEL

     (Sighs heavily)
     I think the hardest part is not knowing whether or not I--chose to
     be here like this. You know, whether I could be doing more good if I
     was still...

     CARTER
     Ascended?

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     CARTER

     (hurt and unhappy with Daniel's words)
     Well, this should be everything you need.
     (softly)
     Good luck.

     DANIEL
     Thanks

   INT--SGC GYM

   [Fraiser and the physiotherapist are assessing Teal'c's physical
   fitness.]

     FRAISER
     Well, that's the last of the physical examination. You have just
     lifted, pushed and pulled more weight than anyone on this base ever
     has. Alien technology notwithstanding.

   [Teal'c walks over to exercise equipment and starts working out some
   more.]

     FRAISER
     Teal'c. I'm clearing you for active duty.

     TEAL'C
     I am not ready.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Sgt Davis works on computer, looks across at Daniel, who shakes his
   head. O'Neill enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Still nothing?

     DANIEL
     Well, I've broadened myself to any Gate activity including outgoing
     wormholes and unauthorised activations. Still have no idea what I'm
     looking for.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe if you stop thinking about it it'll come to you.

   [Daniel gives O'Neill a look.]

     O'NEILL
     Take a break. Fraiser says that Teal'c needs a little pep talk. I've
     been practising in front of the mirror for an hour.

     DANIEL
     Not peppy enough?

     O'NEILL
     Not really.

   [Daniel nods understandingly and leaves with O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Teal'c is sitting on a bed having his back tended to by a medic. He
   still has scarring on his belly near his pouch. The pouch 'x' is much
   smaller than before. Daniel and O'Neill are sitting side by side on a
   bed opposite Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Don't give me the eyebrow!

     DANIEL
     Teal'c, something's bothering you. Something's been bothering you
     since before this injury. We're pretty sure we know what it is.

     TEAL'C
     Then there is no mystery.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, but the point is that you have to talk about it.

   [Teal'c tilts his head a fraction and gives Daniel a look.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, you don't have to talk about it, but you'll feel better if you
     do.

   [Teal'c sits silent.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, forget that crap. I'm your commanding officer.

   [Daniel jerks a thumb to indicate O'Neill.]

     TEAL'C
     Then you must be kept informed of the fitness of all those under
     your command.

     O'NEILL
     Fraiser says you're ready for duty now. Is that true?

     TEAL'C

     (softly)
     I have been dishonest with you.

     O'NEILL
     Oh?

     TEAL'C
     It is unacceptable. All Jaffa children know this without being told.
     They are born with the knowledge. It will not be tolerated.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     TEAL'C
     Kek!

   [O'Neill looks at Daniel for a translation.]

     DANIEL

     (softly to O'Neill)
     Death.
     (Louder to Teal'c)
     Death. You mean death?

     TEAL'C
     Weakness! We use one word for both, for if one is weak one may as
     well be dead.

     DANIEL
     You're talking about the tretonin?

     TEAL'C
     In the beginning I believed it to be the answer for the liberation
     of all Jaffa from the Goa'uld and the reliance on symbiotes. But as
     soon as I began to take it, things changed. I felt my capability was
     being compromised. But I said nothing, hoping that the effects were
     only temporary and that my strength would return. It did not.

     O'NEILL
     Okay--

     TEAL'C
     Forgive me, O'Neill. I should have--

     O'NEILL

     (Interrupts)
     No, there's nothing to forgive. You're still twice as strong as I'll
     ever be and you've got two good knees.

     TEAL'C
     Then the answer to your question is no. I do not feel that I am fit
     for duty.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. I can accept that--for now.

   [Teal'c bows his head, looking grateful. O'Neill leaves the room, then
   waits for Daniel to join him. Outside in the corridor they talk
   quietly.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you're right, not exactly peppy.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, what do you want me to say to the guy?

     DANIEL
     Well, he's lost his confidence. I think he was looking for you to
     reinstill some.

     O'NEILL
     Well if he really has lost his mojo, then there's nothing I can say
     that is going to get it back for him.

     DANIEL

     (intensely)
     It's all in his head.

     O'NEILL
     If he doesn't think he's ready, he's not ready.

   [O'Neill walks away, leaving Daniel looking at Teal'c in concern.]

   INT--SGC--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

   [The room is filled with a lot of lit red candles. Daniel sits down
   cross-legged to join Teal'c on the floor.]

     TEAL'C
     Without a symbiote, kel'no'reem is unnecessary. In fact I have
     discontinued the practise.

   [Teal'c sounds faintly put out, as though he's somehow found himself
   doing something he really doesn't want to do and isn't sure how it
   happened.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I know that you don't actually need to kel'no'reem anymore
     but, ah, just indulge me. You see humans sometimes still meditate
     even though they require REM sleep and I really think this thing
     you're--

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson, for a successful kel'no'reem, there is one element
     required above all others.

     DANIEL
     What?

     TEAL'C
     Silence.

     DANIEL
     Right.

   FLASHBACK, DANIEL'S POV

   [A voice calls "No, master, no!" Daniel's eyes open and he has a
   flashback or vision. There is a prison/labour camp. Jaffa are being
   worked hard. A large ship hovers above. Bra'tac and Rya'c appear, being
   worked. Rya'c falls to his knees and is flogged. He cries out in pain.]

     BRA'TAC
     Leave him alone!

   [A Jaffa--a guard of some kind--starts to whip Bra'tac, watched by a
   blond haired Jaffa. Bra'tac stands stoically silent as he is whipped.]

     RYA'C
     No! Master! Master, no!

   BACK TO INT--SGC INFIRMARY--MOMENTS LATER

   [Daniel's eyes are open. He looks stunned. The scene fades then moves
   on. Daniel is distressed, bowed over, resting his head as Teal'c
   watches him.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c

     DANIEL
     Yeah. I saw him and Bra'tac. I think they're in danger.

     TEAL'C
     Are you familiar with the ambush of Kresh'tar?

     DANIEL
     Ahh--Yeah, the meeting of the Jaffa rebel tribes? Yeah, I've read
     the report. I've heard there were six warriors slaughtered, only you
     and Bra'tac survived. You sustained both of your lives by passing a
     symbiote between the two of you.

     TEAL'C
     There is something that is not in the report. As I lay near death, I
     began to dream. You used your abilities and appeared to me in that
     dream.

   [Surprised, Daniel puts on his glasses to see Teal'c more clearly. It
   is clear he doesn't remember this at all.]

     DANIEL
     I did?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. When I had sufficiently recovered, you appeared to me again
     and that is when I knew--you had stayed with me and watched over me
     for three days. And that is the reason for which I am eternally
     grateful to you, Daniel Jackson. And why I wholeheartedly believe
     you concerning Rya'c.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DANIEL

     (startled)
     So you believe me, too?

     HAMMOND

     (ironic and amused)
     The things I've heard sitting in this chair?

     CARTER
     If this happened before you retook human form, then whatever supply
     of tretonin Bra'tac had would almost surely be depleted by now.

     TEAL'C
     That is why we must act immediately.

     CARTER
     Daniel, you said you thought all this had to do with Gate records.
     Perhaps you innately knew to look for a location.

     DANIEL
     I've been through those records upside-down and backwards, I still
     haven't found anything.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, is there anything familiar about the planet Daniel
     described?

     TEAL'C
     There is not. General Hammond, I request that we send for Rak'nor
     immediately.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

   EXT--PLANET--LABOUR CAMP

   [A Goa'uld mothership is suspended above. A small vessel leaves it and
   hovers above the camp. Jaffa guards patrol while other Jaffa are being
   worked hard and flogged, cries of pain can be heard as we go through
   the camp. Bra'tac and Rya'c are digging.]

     RYA'C
     You grow more and more weak each day.

     BRA'TAC
     You worry too much for me, Rya'c. Tend to your own labour.

   [In another part of the camp.]

     ALBINO JAFFA
     Kek kel-shak. You're through!

   [Some workers are hauled away from a task they could not perform. They
   are lined up for execution, guards gathering before them with staff
   weapons.]

     ALBINO JAFFA
     If you do not work, you will die. They do not work hard enough.

     RYA'C
     No rescue is forthcoming and your supply of tretonin runs low.

     BRA'TAC

     (warning voice)
     Rya'c--

     ALBINO JAFFA
     Kree ka!

     RYA'C
     We will not be able to maintain our workload. They will execute us
     next.

     ALBINO JAFFA
     Kree!

   [One of the workers tries to escape and is killed.]

     BRA'TAC
     Have faith! I will ration my tretonin until the rescue.

     ALBINO JAFFA
     Kek.

   [Rya'c looks away and Bra'tac watches as the rest of the group of
   prisoners is executed. Bra'tac looks furious.]

   INT--SGC--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Rak'nor are present. Daniel and Rak'nor are looking
   at a sketch which most probably has drawn as it matches his flashback.]

     DANIEL
     Any of this familiar to you? A planet with two moons, a naqahdah
     refinery with some sort of antigravity dry dock nearby, with a
     mothership under construction?

     RAK'NOR
     I know the planet of which you describe. Erebus.

   [TEAL'C reacts with concern.]

     DANIEL
     According to Greek mythology, Erebus is a place where condemned
     souls pass as soon as they die.

     RAK'NOR
     Then it is aptly named. The planet is used for the construction of
     Ha'tak vessels and the purification of the naqahdah to build them.
     Only Jaffa prisoner labour is used, it is only they can stand the
     intense heat and toxic gases of the blast furnaces fed by
     underground volcanic systems. Eventually even the Jaffa succumb.

     TEAL'C
     I am aware of such places. Where Jaffa prisoners of war unwilling to
     serve a new Goa'uld master are taken to be worked to death.

     DANIEL
     Which would make it the perfect place to recruit rebels but
     something must have gone wrong.

     RAK'NOR
     The planet was recently taken by Ba'al.

     TEAL'C
     If Bra'tac and Rya'c were in the camp when Ba'al's forces arrived,
     perhaps they were trapped.

     RAK'NOR
     Then they are lost.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     RAK'NOR
     The Stargate on Erebus is impenetrable.

     TEAL'C
     How so?

     RAK'NOR
     A force field much like your iris blocks the Erebus Stargate, making
     attack or rescue through it impossible.

     DANIEL
     Someone must get through it somehow.

     RAK'NOR
     We believe a signal must be used to power down the force field, but
     we have no way of knowing what that signal is.

   FLASHBACK, DANIEL'S POV

   [Bra'tac, Rya'c and rebel Jaffa use zats to disarm guards at the Erebus
   Gate. Bra'tac takes a device from the forearm of a Jaffa guard and uses
   it to remove a force field then punches in the address for the Alpha
   site on the DHD. They are attacked by Jaffa. Bra'tac manages to send a
   signal secretly while the Gate is open. We see Daniel in a hooded cloak
   watching the events.]

   BACK TO INT--SGC--DANIEL'S OFFICE, MOMENTS LATER

   [Daniel rushes out of the room. Teal'c signals that they should
   follow.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is in front of a computer while DANIEL stands over her.]

     DANIEL
     I was there. I saw the whole thing happen. Nothing I could just
     watch. Powerless to interfere.

   [Carter scrolls through records on the computer.]

     DANIEL

     (anxious, impatient)
     Come on, it has to be there!

     CARTER

     (gently)
     Just give me a minute.

     DANIEL
     See, I knew it had something to do with Gate records, I just never
     thought of checking the Alpha Site Gate records.

     CARTER
     Here. A coded energy signal was received and recorded through the
     Alpha Site Gate three months ago. It was analysed but no one was
     able to determine its origin or its purpose.

     DANIEL
     That is the force field deactivation code I saw Bra'tac send right
     before he was captured.

     CARTER
     Are you sure?

     DANIEL
     I am sure.

     CARTER
     I can synthesise this energy signature. If it is the deactivation
     code I can get us through the Gate.

     DANIEL
     And I can provide details of the defences and the lay of the land

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c is dressed in his Jaffa armour, as is Rak'nor.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill. I wish to tell you that I believe I may be a liability on
     this mission.

     O'NEILL
     I don't.

     TEAL'C
     If I should die it is my wish that you watch over Rya'c.

     O'NEILL
     Well, let's see it doesn't come to that, all right?

   [Teal'c bows his head. Daniel glances across at O'Neill, looking a
   little worried at Teal'c's attitude.]

     O'NEILL

     (a little defensive at being caught out in a sappy moment)
     It's his son.

   [Daniel refrains from comment. The Gate opens.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, lets do this.

     CARTER
     Sending signal now.

   [Rak'nor tosses through a shock grenade, which takes out the guards.]

   EXT--EREBUS STARGATE

   [Backed up by SG-3, SG-1 and Rak'nor arrive on Erebus.]

     CARTER

     (looking at the unconscious Jaffa)
     Clear.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. So. That happened. SG-3, secure these guys. Then establish a
     perimeter. Daniel--

   [Daniel goes over to O'Neill then leads the way.]

   EXT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP

   [At the camp it's business as usual work, Jaffa guards abusing their
   prisoners. Bra'tac is trying to take his tretonin but the vial is
   empty. Rya'c is watching.]

     RYA'C
     Master Bra'tac. It is difficult to ration that which you do not
     have.

     BRA'TAC
     If only you had not seen.

     RYA'C
     I have seen. Now tell me the truth. I'm not a child.

     BRA'TAC
     The tretonin is gone.

     RYA'C
     Then you will die. All your words of faith will have been for
     nothing.

     BRA'TAC
     No, not for nothing. For you! You must survive.

     RYA'C
     How long can you live without tretonin?

     BRA'TAC
     As long as I have to.

   EXT--EREBUS--RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE LABOUR CAMP

   [O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and SG-3 are hidden on a ridge near the camp.]

     O'NEILL
     Penhall! Trade me. Give me that thing.

   [Note Penhall was the name of Peter DeLuise's character in "21 Jump
   Street." O'Neill trades weapons with Penhall and uses the sight to view
   the camp.]

     CARTER

     (Searching the camp through her binoculars)
     No sign of Bra'tac. Wait a minute, I've got Rya'c.

     TEAL'C
     If we eliminate that guard position we can create a blind spot.

   [O'Neill hesitates, thinking.]

     TEAL'C
     Infiltration is the best option, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Alright. It'll be dark in an hour. Everybody get comfortable.

   EXT--EREBUS--NIGHT--RIDGE ABOVE THE LABOUR CAMP

   [Backed up by Carter who zats the guard, Teal'c and Rak'nor enter the
   camp. The Albino Jaffa commander starts yelling at a Jaffa guard.]

     O'NEILL
     They're in. Come on. Come on. What's this?

     DANIEL
     Ah--he's dressing the warrior down. Do the bidding of Ba'al. Shut
     up.

     O'NEILL
     Shut up?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, to paraphrase it. You're poison. You're cursed by the wearer
     of horns, you sloppy--

     O'NEILL

     Oh, for crying out loud!
     (he sees more activity from the guards below)
     Damnit.

     CARTER

     (from her position in the camp below)
     I think they've been made.

     O'NEILL
     Just hold on.

   INT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP--NIGHT--JAFFA TENT

   [Teal'c enters the tent where Bra'tac and Rya'c rest with the other
   Jaffa prisoners.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c!

     RYA'C
     Father! I am sorry. Master Bra'tac said that you would come but I
     did not believe.

     TEAL'C
     How is he?

     RYA'C
     He still lives but--I fear not for long.

     BRA'TAC
     Tek'ma'te.

     BRA'TAC
     Old friend. Rak'nor.

     RAK'NOR
     Tek'ma'te, Master Bra'tac.

   [TEAL'C takes out his vial of tretonin.]

     TEAL'C
     There is enough for both of us.

     RYA'C
     We cannot hide here for long. It will take too much time for him to
     regain his strength to walk.

     TEAL'C
     Then we will carry him.

     RAK'NOR
     We have come to take you and Bra'tac away from this place.

     RYA'C
     What about them? What about all the others?

     RAK'NOR
     There are too many

     RYA'C
     They could fight.

     TEAL'C
     Then they will die.

     RYA'C
     If they stay, they will die.

   EXT--EREBUS--NIGHT--RIDGE ABOVE THE LABOUR CAMP

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you've been made. Get outta there. Get outta there! Teal'c!

   [The Albino Jaffa Commander has been told of enemy presence. He
   captures Teal'c and Rak'nor.]

     O'NEILL
     Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

   [Off camera Teal'c is whipped. They can hear his grunts of pain.]

     CARTER

     (has rejoined them on the ridge)
     Sir!
     (she is aghast as Teal'c's suffering)

     O'NEILL
     Hold your position!

     DANIEL

     You're just going to sit here?
     (he is as upset as Carter)

     O'NEILL (bitter and determined)
     Yes! Just going to sit here. Till we can find another way in.

   INT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP--DAY--JAFFA TENT

   [Teal'c is dragged into the tent where Rya'c and Bra'tac are and is
   dumped on the floor. The others tend to him.]

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c. You are still alive.

     RYA'C
     Yes, Father.

     TEAL'C
     That is all that matters. What of Bra'tac?

     RYA'C
     The tretonin has helped. What of you, father? Can you walk?

     TEAL'C
     Not at the moment.

     RYA'C
     You must. Those who cannot work are killed.

     TEAL'C
     You must not lose your faith, Rya'c. Ra'knor and I did not come
     alone. Even now a rescue is under way.

   EXT--EREBUS--RIDGE ABOVE THE LABOUR CAMP

     CARTER
     Search patrol went off in that direction headed for the Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     Well, they don't believe Teal'c and Rak'nor are working alone.

     DANIEL
     This is my fault.

     O'NEILL
     How's that?

     DANIEL
     Because I should have done something when I had the chance. When I
     had the power.

     O'NEILL

     (Softly)
     I think we've already established that wouldn't have worked out
     either. Nope, it's time for plan B.

     CARTER

     (looks startled)
     We have a plan B?

     O'NEILL
     No. But it's time for one.

     CARTER
     We've already determined there are too many guards for us to take
     out the whole camp with our current numbers.

     DANIEL
     We need a distraction.

     CARTER
     Grenades?

     O'NEILL
     Think bigger.

     CARTER
     Claymores.

   [O'Neill looks up at the mothership floating in the air near the camp.]

     O'NEILL
     Much bigger.

   INT--GOA'ULD MOTHERSHIP

   [Carter and Daniel use transporter rings to enter the ship.]

   EXT--EREBUS--RIDGE ABOVE THE LABOUR CAMP

     O'NEILL

     Major.
     (to other SG team officer)
     Target TRP1.

   INT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP--DAY--JAFFA TENT

     RAK'NOR

     (Of Bra'tac)
     His strength still grows.

     TEAL'C
     Good. Rya'c, you and Rak'nor must spread the word. If we wish for
     our rescue to be successful the others must be prepared to fight.

     RYA'C
     How will they know when?

     RAK'NOR
     When the time is right they will know.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed

     RYA'C
     Can you fight?

     TEAL'C
     I am not the Jaffa I once was.

     RYA'C
     No!

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c--

     RYA'C
     No! You are Teal'c. There is no greater warrior.

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c. I am--weak.

     RYA'C
     Father, please!

     TEAL'C
     Rya'c! No matter what, you must survive, or I have come for nothing.
     Now go.

   [Rya'c reluctantly leaves the tent.]

   INT--GOA'ULD MOTHERSHIP

   [Carter plants C4 while Daniel watches their backs.]

     CARTER
     Once this panel goes it will only take a few seconds for the entire
     antigravity platform to shut down.

   INT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP--DAY--JAFFA TENT

     BRA'TAC
     It has been difficult for both of us.

     TEAL'C
     You are feeling better.

     BRA'TAC
     You will not be rid of me so easily. When the time comes I will be
     ready, old friend.

     TEAL'C
     As will I.

     BRA'TAC
     I am not so sure. This tretonin seems to have had an effect on your
     memory.

     TEAL'C
     Why would you say such a thing?

     BRA'TAC
     Because you have forgotten that a warrior's true strength comes from
     his heart and his mind. You have had a physical advantage over me
     for a long time and yet I have never lost a sparring match to you.

     TEAL'C
     Because for years, old man, I have let you win.

     BRA'TAC

     (Smiles, pleased with Teal'c's answer)
     Better. Much better.

   INT--GOA'ULD MOTHERSHIP

   [Carter and Daniel are trying to leave the ship but Jaffa are near the
   rings.]

     CARTER
     This could be a problem.

   EXT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP

   [Rya'c is spreading the word about the fight. The Albino Jaffa
   commander spots him.]

     ALBINO JAFFA
     This is not your work station. Take him!

   [O'Neill watches as Rya'c is taken away.]

     ALBINO JAFFA

     (to the prisoners)
     If you do not work then you will die. This one does not know where
     his work station is.

     TEAL'C

     (emerging from tent)
     He is young and still able to work.

     ALBINO JAFFA
     You dare to speak to me!

     TEAL'C

     (holds out his arms in supplication)
     Only to ask that I take his place.

     ALBINO JAFFA
     So be it!

     RYA'C
     No! No!

   [He is dragged away and Teal'c stumbled into his place, painfully
   pulling himself upright.]

     ALBINO JAFFA
     You are barely able to stand. You would not have lasted another day.
     It was a--good trade.

   EXT--EREBUS--RIDGE ABOVE THE LABOUR CAMP

   [O'Neill contacts Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, what's the holdup?

     CARTER
     We're a go in thirty seconds, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Soon we won't have thirty seconds.

   EXT--EREBUS LABOUR CAMP

     ALBINO JAFFA
     You were once the first Prime of Apophis. Now you're nothing but a
     weak, pathetic shol'va.

   [Rya'c looks away.]

     BRA'TAC
     Do not look away! Be strong for him. What better way for Teal'c to
     die than to be looking upon the face of his son?

   [The gravity field of the ship is destroyed above them. The Albino
   Jaffa commander, standing over Teal'c and about to fire, pauses then
   looks to see what's happening. An alarm sounds. As the ship falls to
   the ground O'Neill et al open fire.]

     BRA'TAC

     (rallying the prisoners to attack)
     Take them now!

   [The prisoners turn on the guards and the battle begins. Teal'c jumps
   the Albino Jaffa.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, boys! Have at 'em!

   [Gun battle ensues as O'Neill and his men engage the Jaffa guards.
   Teal'c is losing his fight against the Albino Jaffa. Rya'c tries to
   help but is hurled aside. Teal'c regains some strength and
   determination and fights back more fiercely. Rak'nor sees what is
   happening and moves to help Teal'c.]

     RYA'C
     Wait!

   [Teal'c breaks the overseer's neck. Guards charge and shoulder to
   shoulder Teal'c, Bra'tac and Rak'nor face them, raising their staff
   weapons then firing in unison. Fade to white.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Bra'tac sits on a stretcher, being tended to by Fraiser as O'Neill,
   Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c, supported by Rya'c and Rak'nor, walk down
   the ramp.]

     HAMMOND
     Welcome back, SG-1.

     O'NEILL
     The camp has been liberated, Sir. All the prisoners relocated to the
     Alpha Site.

     RAK'NOR
     They are anxious to join the rebellion.

     BRA'TAC
     Then my mission has been a success. Hammond of Texas, I find myself
     once more in your debt.

     HAMMOND
     I think it's Doctor Jackson you owe on this one.

     TEAL'C

     (nods gratefully)
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c bows his head. Daniel, stunned and humbled, bows his head in
   response.]

   INT--SGC--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

   [Teal'c and Daniel sit surrounded by candles, about to kel'no'reem.]

     TEAL'C
     Kel'no'reem is unnecessary. Although it does make me feel--better.
     Colonel O'Neill has officially informed me that--I have my 'mojo'
     back.

     DANIEL
     I guess I should--I should be thanking you, actually. You see I used
     to--used to feel like I didn't belong...anywhere, really. I think I
     thought the--whole ascension thing would change that. Now I'm
     realising that the sacrifices were far too great. My life here is
     too important to just leave behind. I guess what I'm trying to say
     is that for the first time in my life I feel like I'm a part of
     something. Something important.

     TEAL'C
     As do I.

   [Camera moves back, the candles blur.]

   [Footnote. Erebus was known as the embodiment of primordial darkness,
   the son of Chaos. Later legend describes Erebus as the Infernal Region
   below the earth. In this version, Hades was split into two regions
   Erebus, which the dead have to pass shortly after they have died, and
   Tartarus, the deepest region, where the Titans were imprisoned. He is
   often used metaphorically for Hades itself. [14]Pantheon
