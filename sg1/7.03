   TEASER

   INT: SGC--HALLWAY

   [Carter steps out of the elevator on Level 16.]

     CARTER
     General, what's this all about?

     HAMMOND
     At 0920 hours this morning, someone tried to enter the base using
     this.

   [He hands her something encased in a plastic sleeve as they walk
   through the corridor together.]

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill's security ID.

     HAMMOND
     After the person in question was taken into custody, he insisted on
     seeing you.

   [They arrive at a doorway that is being guarded by two SFs.]

     CARTER
     Me? Why?

     HAMMOND

     Well, I was hoping you could figure that one out, Major.
     (to the SF on guard)
     Open it.

   [Hammond and Carter enter a holding room to find a teenage boy
   stretched out on the bunk. He has cropped fair hair and brown eyes,
   blue jeans, a grey t-shirt and beige jacket, all too big for him.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Thank you. Now we're gettin' somewhere. Sergeant, that, uh, coffee I
     asked for half an hour ago? You know, any time you feel like gettin'
     it?

   [Hammond nods to the sergeant and he departs.]

     CARTER
     He's a boy, Sir.

     YOUNG JACK

     (his attitude is very familiar)
     As it turns out, Carter, yes, I am. For the moment.

     CARTER

     (amused)
     Do I know you?

     YOUNG JACK
     Come on! It's me.

   [Carter looks at him.]

     HAMMOND
     We tried to contact Colonel O'Neill, even sent someone to his house.

     CARTER
     Do you understand how much trouble you're in right now?
     Impersonating a military officer is a federal offence.

     YOUNG JACK

     (frustrated)
     I am not impersonating anyone. I am Jack O'Neill.

   [Hammond and Carter share a dubious look.]

   END TEASER. OPENING CREDITS

   INT: SGC--HOLDING ROOM

   [Close-up of O'Neill's security ID. The name on the ID is 'O'Neill,
   John J.' and the date of birth is 1952. We cut to the boy sitting
   glowering on the bed.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Finally!

   [He gets up as the sergeant returns with his drink, having to hold up
   his jeans as he takes a sip. His face freezes.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Hot chocolate? Are you kidding?

     CARTER

     (referring to the ID)
     Where did you get this?

     YOUNG JACK

     (sets the cup down on the bedside table)
     I didn't.
     (hikes up jeans)
     I didn't get it anywhere. It's mine.

     CARTER

     (disbelieving)
     Because you're Colonel O'Neill?

     YOUNG JACK
     Exactly.

   [Carter is unimpressed.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Look, last night, I ate some dinner, had a beer, went to bed and
     woke up like this. Now can we please just get to the part where you
     and Fraiser run some tests, find a cure and make me big again?

   [Daniel walks into the room and stands beside Carter.]

     DANIEL
     This is the security breach?

     YOUNG JACK

     (relieved)
     Daniel! Will you tell them who I am? Please?

     DANIEL
     Okay. Love to. Who are you?

   [Young Jack fumes.]

     HAMMOND
     This young man claims he's Colonel O'Neill.

     DANIEL
     It's a joke, right?

   [Carter smiles in a pained manner and shakes her head.]

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

     YOUNG JACK

     (frustrated)
     Daniel! DANIEL
     Sounds like him. At least the loud, grating parts.

     YOUNG JACK

     Okay. You want proof? Carter, you once carried a Tok'ra named
     Jolinar, who gave her life to save you.
     (Carter's smile is wiped off her face)
     Daniel, until recently, you were an ascended being. Ya broke the
     rules, ya got yourself kicked outta the Oma Desala fan club and had
     your memory erased.

   [Teal'c enters, walking past Hammond to stand directly before the boy,
   who stares right back at him, not intimidated in the least.]

     YOUNG JACK
     And you and Bra'tac both just lost your snakes in a Goa'uld ambush.
     Had your tretonin yet this morning?

   [He and Teal'c stare at one another for a long moment, then Teal'c
   turns to the others.]

     TEAL'C
     How could this child possess such knowledge?

   [Daniel and Carter have no idea.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Because--it's--me!

   [Furious, embarrassed, he hikes up jeans yet again.]

   INT: SGC--HALLWAY

   [Hammond leads the others out of the holding room, coming to a halt a
   short distance away.]

     HAMMOND
     Would anyone care to speculate how a boy could be aware of our most
     classified information?

     CARTER
     Well, Sir, it could be him.

     DANIEL
     There is a physical resemblance.

     HAMMOND
     But he can't be more than fifteen years old. Are you saying Colonel
     O'Neill has, somehow, regressed more than 30 years overnight?

     DANIEL
     Stranger things have happened.

     TEAL'C
     Name but one.

     DANIEL
     Well, there was the time he got really old, the time he became a
     caveman, the time we all swapped bodies.

     HAMMOND

     (holding up his hand)
     Why don't we move on to the testing portion of this exercise?

   INT: SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Dr. Fraiser, Teal'c, Hammond, Carter and Daniel are seated around the
   conference table.]

     HAMMOND
     Are you certain, Doctor?

     FRAISER

     (looking at a medical report)
     Initial tests show that within an acceptable margin of error, the
     boy's DNA is virtually identical to Colonel O'Neill's.

     CARTER
     What size margin of error are we talking about?

     FRAISER

     Very small. In a court of law, the DNA sample we took from the boy
     would be considered a high-probability match to the DNA we have on
     file from Colonel O'Neill. There is a...
     (hesitates)
     ... tiny abnormality, but for all intents and purposes, it's him.

     DANIEL
     Tiny abnormality? Like the fact that he's suddenly quite a few years
     younger than he's supposed to be?

     FRAISER
     To be honest, this is out of my league. We've got some specialists
     flying in. We're gonna run more tests, see what we can learn.

     HAMMOND
     In the meantime, I suggest we try to make him as comfortable as
     possible.

     CARTER
     I'll go set up a PlayStation.

   INT: SGC--COMMISSARY

   [Young Jack sits at a table, Carter and Teal'c joining him. They're
   both grinning at him.]

     YOUNG JACK
     You know, uh, I think you two are enjoying this just a little too
     much.

     CARTER
     Well, you are kinda cute.

     YOUNG JACK

     (sharply rebuking)
     That's 'Sir' to you.
     (Carter loses the smile)
     And being trapped inside a scrawny little body isn't my idea of
     cute, Carter.

     TEAL'C
     Does possessing a younger body not have certain advantages, O'Neill?

     YOUNG JACK
     No. Not seein' it. Whaddya mean?

     TEAL'C
     Do you not experience increased health and vitality?

     YOUNG JACK
     My vitality was just fine, thank you.

     CARTER
     I think what Teal'c is saying is valid. How many of us wouldn't
     trade everything for the chance to be young again? Live our lives
     over?

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah, well, I don't plan on staying like this.

     CARTER
     Well, in the meantime, may I make a suggestion? Try enjoying this as
     much as we are.

   [She smiles.]

   [Young Jack frowns at her. She loses the smile and swallows a little.]

     CARTER
     Sir.

   EXT: ESTABLISHING SHOT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE

   INT: O'NEILL'S HOUSE

   [Teal'c, Carter, Daniel and Young Jack enter O'Neill's house, walking
   into the dining room. The table is littered with empty cartons of
   Chinese take-out food, beer and wine bottles.]

     DANIEL
     Well, it's nice to know some things don't change.

     YOUNG JACK
     I wasn't exactly expecting visitors.

     CARTER
     We'll have this stuff sent back to the lab for analysis.

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, if they find MSG, I will never order from them again! Come on,
     what are we doing here, exactly?

     DANIEL
     Well, this is the last place you remember being.

   [He hesitates, at a loss for words.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Older?

   [Teal'c is investigating the contents of the fridge.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you conducting some sort of scientific experiment, O'Neill?

     YOUNG JACK
     Hey, come on! That salsa's still good!

   [He heads into the kitchen and puts the salsa back into the fridge
   before taking out a beer. Carter patronisingly tweaks the bottle from
   his fingers before he can take a drink.]

     CARTER
     What was the last thing you ate, Sir?

     YOUNG JACK
     Four cheese burritos, some guacamole on the side.

     DANIEL
     Anything else?

     YOUNG JACK
     A beer. Then I hit the sack.

     CARTER
     So, whatever happened to you must have occurred once you were
     asleep.

   [Young Jack shrugs.]

   INT: O'NEILL'S BEDROOM

   [Establishing shot of photos of O'Neill in cammos and a very young
   Charlie in a picture frame. Young Jack stands in the doorway as his
   teammates search his bedroom. The walls are cream, the windows draped
   with rich russet curtains and Venetian blinds. The furniture is dark
   wood, Shaker-style. O'Neill has an armchair with a reading lamp by the
   window, two bureaus and a number of bookcases filled with books and
   objects. The walls are hung with military memorabilia and paintings of
   fish.]

   [Carter sniffs a glass dubiously then walks over to check the linen
   chest at the foot of the bed as Young Jack notices Daniel rummaging
   through his underwear drawer in the bureau and stalks over to stop
   him.]

     YOUNG JACK

     (indignant)
     Hey! Do you mind?

   [Daniel hands over the tight grey jersey trunks he's holding to Young
   Jack, throwing up his hands in surrender. Daniel goes over to check out
   the bookcases and Young Jack follows, walking over to where Teal'c is
   reading something.]

     YOUNG JACK

     (objecting)
     Teal'c?

   [Teal'c reaches for an overhead lamp and Young Jack flashes back to
   green globes of light spinning in a white mist, the face of an Asgard
   appearing.]

     YOUNG JACK

     (disoriented)
     Whoa!

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill?

     DANIEL
     What is it?

   [Daniel and Carter walk over to join them, concerned.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Either I'm remembering a particularly bad dream. Or the Asgard paid
     me a little visit last night.

   INT: SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond, SG-1 and Young Jack sit at the conference table. Young Jack
   is still in a foul mood, tapping the table irritably.]

     HAMMOND
     No offence, but what you're saying doesn't make any sense.

     DANIEL
     Jack's account sounds like a number of UFO abduction case files I've
     read.

     YOUNG JACK

     (aggravated)
     This you remember? My birthday you forget.

   [Teal'c is very amused. O'Neill really has a problem with Daniel not
   remembering every single conceivable detail about him with crystal
   clarity.]

     DANIEL
     Looks like you'll have a lot more.

     TEAL'C
     This encounter is incongruous with all previous contact we have had
     with the Asgard.

     CARTER
     Thor has indicated that the Asgard have been keeping an eye on human
     development on Earth in the past.

     HAMMOND
     But we're allies now. We've cooperated with them on a number of
     missions.

     YOUNG JACK
     This, I would not have agreed to.

     CARTER
     What could they possibly hope to gain from secretly making you
     younger against your will?

     YOUNG JACK

     (thinks for a second, then shakes his head)
     I got nothing.

     DANIEL
     General, uh, I'd like to cross-reference some of these old abduction
     accounts, see if I can find any connection.

     HAMMOND
     Please do. Major, I believe you had a briefing to run at 1300 hours.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir. I'll be there.

     YOUNG JACK
     Wait, wait, the F-302 briefing? I thought I was running that.

     HAMMOND
     Given your current situation, I feel it would be best if Major
     Carter handled it. I'm sure you can impart any information she needs
     to know to fill in the gap.

     YOUNG JACK
     But, I mean, I'm the one?

     HAMMOND

     (cutting him off)
     Good. Dismissed.

   [Hammond gets up and leaves. The team departs, leaving Young Jack
   sitting alone.]

   INT: SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is looking through some papers when he hears a tap at his
   door.]

     HAMMOND

     Come in.
     (young Jack opens the door and enters)
     Jack, try to understand. Your situation puts me in a very difficult
     position.

     YOUNG JACK
     Uh, General, no offence, but you're not the one who went to bed
     watching CNN and woke up as part of the MTV generation.

     HAMMOND
     Which is exactly why Major Carter's going to handle that briefing.

     YOUNG JACK
     Sir, I've flown the 302 more times than anyone else.

     HAMMOND
     Be that as it may, the bottom line is, a room full of seasoned
     pilots aren't going to respect the opinion of a boy.

     YOUNG JACK
     Sir, I just look like one. For the moment. But those men in that
     room need my expertise. And plus, you know, if they're gonna be
     working here, they're gonna have to start gettin' used to, you know,
     unusual things happening.

     HAMMOND
     Look, Jack, no one is disputing that you may continue to be a
     valuable asset to the SGC. But under the circumstances, there's
     nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

     YOUNG JACK

     Yes, Sir. I understand.
     (He hesitates briefly before leaving)
     Dumb idea.

   INT: SGC--DANIEL'S LAB

   [Teal'c is working at a laptop while Daniel is busy at his shelves. In
   the background, we see a tank of tropical fish.]

     TEAL'C
     It would appear that a great many of the Tau'ri have encountered
     beings from other worlds.

     DANIEL
     Yep, hmm. Little do they know how close they are to the truth.

     TEAL'C
     What, exactly, are we looking for, Daniel Jackson?

     DANIEL
     Well, any abduction accounts that match Jack's story, and, um,
     obviously, anyone claiming to have physically regressed several
     decades overnight. We just need to enter our search parameters into
     the database.

     TEAL'C
     It has already been done.

   [Daniel walks up behind Teal'c to see the list on the computer screen.]

     DANIEL
     Wow. That's a lot of people.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     DANIEL
     Let's see if any of these match Jack's story exactly. What he said
     he saw. Four green lights.

   [Teal'c continues punches in a new search parameter and a new list
   appears onscreen.]

     DANIEL
     That's a little more reasonable. That's interesting. Of the narrowed
     down accounts, the most recent is from...

     TEAL'C
     Nineteen years ago.

     DANIEL
     Eight are here in the States. You know, if these addresses are still
     valid, we should go talk to these people in person.

     TEAL'C
     What do you hope to learn?

     DANIEL
     I guess we'll know when we learn it.

   [Smiling, he pats Teal'c on the shoulder.]

   INT: SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

   [The conference table has been pushed aside and the chairs set in neat
   rows for the pilots. The squadron have "1st SFW: Snakeskinners"
   insignia and wear F-302 badges.]

     CARTER

     As your Intel packages show, the F-302 is a space-worthy,
     fighter-interceptor aircraft reverse-engineered from Goa'uld
     technology.
     (Carter walks up to the podium)
     Your upcoming mission has been dubbed Operation Blue Phoenix. It'll
     be a live-fire combat simulation to test how well the 302 fares
     against actual death gliders.
     (One of the pilots raises his hand.)
     Captain?

     CAPTAIN
     Major, according to our mission reports, you were second seat on the
     most recent mission involving the 302.

     CARTER
     Yes, and that one included close combat. We'll be covering what was
     learned in that encounter in this briefing.

     CAPTAIN
     Didn't Colonel O'Neill pilot that mission?

     CARTER
     Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.

     MAJOR
     The Colonel also commanded the X-302 during both previous hyperspace
     window missions, didn't he, Major?

     CARTER
     What's your point, Major?

     CAPTAIN
     With all due respect, Ma'am, shouldn't Colonel O'Neill be running
     this briefing?

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill is unavailable. However, I've prepared several
     computer models which should help you understand how the 302 handles
     in combat situations.

     CAPTAIN
     Major, no offence, but those aren't going to help me when I'm
     pulling 6 Gs in a dogfight against an alien ship.

   [The other pilots murmur agreement.]

     CARTER

     (irritated and cool, turning to activate a computer screen)
     As you should know, Captain, the 302 has inertial dampening systems
     which I am more than qualified to explain in detail, so, let's
     just...

   [Voices sound outside the briefing room, immediately distracting
   attention from Carter's briefing.]

     YOUNG JACK

     (from outside)
     I just dropped by to say--Ow!

     SF ONE

     (from outside)
     Sir, please do not resist.

     YOUNG JACK
     Hey, ease up, big guy!

     CARTER
     Stay focused.

     SF ONE

     (still outside)
     Just relax, Sir.

     YOUNG JACK
     I'm warning you!

     SF ONE
     Sir, please, stay there.

     YOUNG JACK
     Didn't I just say I'm warning you? Hey! Oh! Alright! That's it! Now,
     I'm mad!

   [Carter surrenders and goes over to open the door. A very large SF has
   Young Jack pinned against the wall. He's not happy.]

     CARTER
     You can release him.

   [The SF steps smartly away and Young Jack dusts himself off.]

     YOUNG JACK

     I'll forgo the charges for assaulting a superior officer. Carter.
     (he pauses when he draws level with her)
     I coulda taken him.

     CARTER

     (slightly sarcastic)
     I'm sure.

     YOUNG JACK

     Sorry, I'm late.
     (He stands before the group of pilots as Carter follows him in)
     What'd I miss?

     CARTER
     We were just covering the 302's flight capabilities.

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, then, I'm just in time. Here's what you need to know.

     CAPTAIN
     Major, is this a joke?

     CARTER
     No. This is Colonel O'Neill.

   [The pilots exchange amused looks.]

     YOUNG JACK
     I'm only gonna say this once, so I'd suggest that you listen up.

     CAPTAIN

     (scoffing)
     Whatever you say.

     YOUNG JACK
     Hey! I realize it doesn't actually say 'Colonel' anywhere on my
     uniform, but it should.

   [The pilots look to Carter for confirmation and at her nod, clear their
   throats, sit up straighter and settle down.]

     CAPTAIN
     Yes, Sir.

     YOUNG JACK

     Now. Velocity is key during engagement with a glider. Now, your
     instincts are gonna tell ya to floor it, because it's faster and
     more manoeuvrable, but you've got to stay in control.
     (He turns to see the screen behind him)
     Uh, oh, yeah, and the, uh, inertial dampeners only compensate ninety
     per cent when pulling negative Gs. So the real trick is knowing your
     enemy so you can anticipate their next moves.
     (he walks over to the podium and clicks on the computer display)
     Okay, Death Gliders 101.

   EXT: FARMYARD

   [Daniel and Teal'c are questioning an elderly man in what appears to be
   a farmyard. He is stacking wood, a woman behind him grooming a horse.]

     WERNER
     May I ask why the United States Air Force is taking a renewed
     interest in my story after twenty-six years?

     DANIEL
     Well, all I can tell you is that we have some new information.

     WERNER
     Will it prove my story true?

     DANIEL
     Eventually, maybe.

     TEAL'C
     Please, tell us what happened to you.

     WERNER
     I was asleep in my bed, and a light appeared in my room and took me.

   [We flash back to young man in pyjamas floating in a white mist, lit by
   a blue light.]

     DANIEL
     Took you where?

     WERNER

     Some kind of space craft I suppose. I was weightless, floating in
     midair.
     (an orange device is lowered and bright white light illuminates the
     young man from above)
     And yet, it was dark

     PAMELA

     (simultaneously)
     It was dark, cold.

   [Daniel and Teal'c, dressed in different clothes, are sitting at a
   kitchen table, talking with a middle-aged woman.]

     PAMELA
     I couldn't move a muscle even though I was wide awake.

     DANIEL
     After the light hit you, then what?

     PAMELA
     The devices came.

   [In flashback we see a younger woman in pyjamas floating in midair, an
   orange device surrounded by silver metallic tendrils suspended above
   her. Green globes of light circle her.]

     PAMELA
     They were these green, glowing balls that floated around me.

   [A man speaks in a Chinese dialect. Daniel and Teal'c, again dressed
   differently, sit in an apartment facing an old Chinese man and an young
   female interpreter.]

     INTERPRETER

     He said that after the small green spheres stopped scanning him.
     (The man speaks again)
     They left him alone for a long while.

   [In flashback we see a frightened young Chinese man looking around
   him.]

     INTERPRETER
     Then a voice spoke to him, telling him not to be afraid and that he
     would soon be safe again.

     DANIEL
     Could you ask Professor Wu if he actually saw who was speaking to
     him?

   [The interpreter asks the question in the Chinese dialect, Professor Wu
   nods, and we flash back to the young Chinese man looking directly at
   and Asgard.]

   EXT: ESTABLISHING SHOT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT: SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Daniel and Carter are briefing the general.]

     DANIEL

     (referring to a book he is holding)
     All the accounts were basically identical, they all matched Jack's
     version of events exactly.

     CARTER
     Except none of them experienced any kind of physical changes as a
     result of the abduction.

     DANIEL
     No, they didn't, but everything else is bang on. Taken while
     sleeping, floating paralysis, out of body experience. Now,
     admittedly, all of this does sound familiar, clich&eacute; even, if
     you watch enough TV, but, um, they all described four green globes
     that seemed to defy gravity, buzzing around them like insects. Now,
     that's too specific a detail to be a coincidence.

     HAMMOND
     The being that abducted them? I assume they described an Asgard as
     well?

     DANIEL
     Short, big eyes, no hair, weird voice?

     CARTER
     The Asgard haven't responded to our attempted communications.

     FRAISER

     (coming in from behind them)
     Well, if help is coming, it better arrive soon.

   INT: SGC--GUEST QUARTERS

   [Young Jack is playing a game on his PlayStation when Carter knocks.]

     YOUNG JACK
     It's open.

     CARTER
     How are you doin'?

   [Young Jack pauses the game and turns around to face Carter.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, I think I'm gettin' another zit, and, uh, oh, yeah, I'm still
     a kid. Uh, but beyond that I'm doin' just peachy, thanks. Why?

   [Appearing extremely reluctant, Carter moves over to sit on the bed.
   She is grave and unusually hesitant.]

     CARTER
     Janet's just finished going over the genetic team's analysis of your
     test results.

     YOUNG JACK
     How bad can it be?

     CARTER
     You're probably not feeling the effects yet, but, something is
     happening to your body at the cellular level. Basically, your
     genetic structure is growing more unstable.

   [Young Jack cuts her off impatiently.]

     CARTER

     (she looks down, closing her eyes for a moment in sorrow)
     Colonel, you're dying.

   [Young Jack sobers up immediately as the news sinks in.]

   INT: SGC--INFIRMARY

   [Dr. Fraiser takes a blood sample from Young Jack, Carter hovering in
   attendance.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Honestly, I feel fine.

     FRAISER
     You'll start to notice symptoms as the condition worsens.

     YOUNG JACK
     How long do I have?

     FRAISER
     It's hard to say.

     YOUNG JACK
     Say it anyway.

     FRAISER
     Weeks, days, I don't know. You'll notice fatigue first. In the end,
     your body's vital organs will completely shut down.

     CARTER
     It's like something inside you is causing a total system failure.

     YOUNG JACK

     (bitter)
     I don't get it. We helped save their skinny asses from the
     Replicators and as a thanks, they shrink me and leave me to die.

     CARTER
     We're exploring every option we have, Colonel. We just need you to
     hang in there.

   [Young O'Neill smiles for a second in an unconvincing effort to
   reassure Carter.]

   INT: SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter and Jacob walk up the stairs from the control room to the
   briefing room.]

     CARTER
     Thanks for coming. I'm sure it'll help coming directly from you.

     JACOB
     How are Mark and the kids?

     CARTER
     Good, great, the kids are great. I'll tell them you said hi.

   [Jacob pauses as they reach the top of the stairs and he sees Young
   Jack standing with Daniel, Teal'c and Hammond by the briefing table.]

     JACOB

     (staring)
     I'm sorry, Sam told me what was going on, but, what could anyone
     possibly hope to gain from this?

     YOUNG JACK
     Can we just, uh, get on with it? I'm not gettin' any younger.

     JACOB
     Well, as I told Sam, our options are pretty limited.

     YOUNG JACK
     You come all this way just to say goodbye?

     JACOB
     At this point, I'm here to recommend we put you in stasis until we
     better understand your condition.

     YOUNG JACK
     You want to freeze me?

     CARTER
     Colonel, we're not talking about cryogenics as we know it here on
     Earth. The risk involved is minimal.

     YOUNG JACK

     Yeah, well, I've been down this road with the Tok'ra before. No
     offence, Jacob, but the last time you guys helped me out of a jam,
     (he uses his fingers to describe quotation marks in the air)
     I ended up rescuing an old girlfriend I'd never met before.

     JACOB
     We would never subject you to another blending without your express
     permission.

     YOUNG JACK
     Good, because it's never gonna happen.

     JACOB

     (stepping a little closer)
     No pressure, Jack, but you need to make a decision. We have a team
     standing by, but if you wait too long, we may not be able to reverse
     the cellular breakdown.

     CARTER
     Colonel, please.

     HAMMOND
     It's your choice, Jack.

     YOUNG JACK
     Can I have five minutes to think about it?

     HAMMOND
     You can have ten, Colonel.

   [Young Jack walks away from them.]

   INT: SGC--HALLWAY

   [Daniel and Carter are headed for the guest quarters.]

     CARTER
     You think he'll do it?

     DANIEL
     If I have to drag the little tyke kicking and screaming through the
     Gate myself. I didn't come all this way to watch him die like this.

   [They find a guard unconscious on the floor and Daniel takes off down
   the hallway at a dead run as Carter reaches for the phone.]

     CARTER

     (into phone)
     We have a security breach. Level 25. Guest quarters.

   [Young Jack swipes into the elevator just as Daniel comes around the
   corner and the base alarm sounds. Security teams are sweeping the
   base.]

     SF
     Go, go, go!

   [Young Jack emerges from behind a ventilation panel, runs down the
   hallway and opens the familiar hatch which leads to the surface.]

   INT: SGC--HALLWAYS

   [Hammond leads Carter and Daniel down a hallway towards the elevator]

     HAMMOND
     Security teams have swept the base three times in the past six
     hours, inside and out. They found nothing. I think it's safe to
     assume he's no longer here.

     CARTER
     Well, Colonel O'Neill knows the SGC as well as anyone. If he wanted
     a way out, I'm sure he'd find one.

     HAMMOND
     Well, I've notified state and local authorities. With any luck,
     they'll find him soon.

   [Dr. Fraiser arrives in a rush.]

     FRAISER

     (grave)
     Sir, there's something you all need to see.

   EXT: NIGHT: LIQUOR STORE

   [Young Jack is escorted from a liquor store by an irritated clerk.]

     CLERK
     Go on home, kid, before I call the cops. It's a school night, for
     cryin' out loud.

     YOUNG JACK
     How about light beer?

     CLERK
     Give me a break.

   [He heads back into the store.]

   [Young Jack sits despondently on one of the posts protecting the liquor
   store. He glances around as a man in an Air Force jacket passes him.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Harley?

   [The man turns questioningly as he hears his name.]

     HARLAN
     Excuse me?

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah, Harlan Beck. You served in Operation Proven Force out of
     Incirlik, right?

     BECK
     Yeah, during the Gulf. How'd you know that, kid?

     YOUNG JACK

     What? Are you kidding? I ran--
     (He stops himself as he sees the questioning look on Beck's face. He
     scratches his cheek and tries another tack)
     I mean, uh, my uncle knew a Lt. Beck from the war. Yeah, said he was
     a stand up guy. Flew an AC-130 gunship over Baghdad.

     HARLAN
     Well, then, you're uncle had to be in the Special Ops.

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah, he was. Colonel Jack O'Neill?

     BECK
     You're Jack O'Neill's nephew? I didn't know he had a sibling.

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, used to. Uh, yeah, Uncle Jack's been like a father to me. You
     know, since my folks died.

     BECK
     Ah. So, how's old Jack doin' anyway?

     YOUNG JACK
     Uh, he's fine, and he's not that old, either.

     BECK
     Well, tell him, tell him Harley said to watch his six.

   [Harley turns to walk into the liquor store.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Hey, yeah, uh, speaking of six? Look, uh, seeing as how you know my
     uncle and all, you think you could do me a little favour?

   [Harlan shakes his head, smiles and goes into the store.]

   INT: SGC--INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is talking with Hammond, Daniel and Carter while Jacob sits at
   the computer.]

     FRAISER
     Selmak has had a chance to digest some of the DNA test results we've
     been collecting, and it seems Colonel O'Neill's condition isn't what
     we first thought.

     CARTER
     He isn't dying?

     FRAISER
     He is dying, but we think we know the cause. When we first compared
     Colonel O'Neill's DNA samples to the ones we had on file, the match
     was almost perfect.

     DANIEL
     Almost? You said there was a tiny abnormality.

     FRAISER
     That's right, Selmak thinks he knows why.

     SELMAK
     This is not Colonel O'Neill.

     CARTER
     But?

     FRAISER
     He's a clone.

   [They react in surprise.]

   INT: SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are waiting for Hammond.]

     HAMMOND

     (into the phone)
     I see. Keep me informed.
     (He hangs up)
     No word yet on--What, exactly, do we call him at this point?

     CARTER
     Duplicate O'Neill?

     DANIEL
     Sir, we think we might have a clearer idea of what might be going
     on.

     HAMMOND
     Please, enlighten me.

     TEAL'C
     We know that the Asgard clone themselves.

     DANIEL
     Their very existence depends on their ability to clone their bodies
     and then transfer their consciousness from one to the next.

     CARTER
     But they suffer from grave medical conditions due to thousands of
     years of cloning.

     DANIEL
     Which will ultimately lead to the fall of their civilization if they
     can't solve the problem of diminishing returns in their cloning
     technology.

     HAMMOND
     What does this have to do with Colonel O'Neill?

     DANIEL
     We had the abductees' DNA, that Teal'c and I interviewed, scanned
     for the same abnormalities as, duplicate O'Neill. As far as we can
     tell, none of them are clones.

     HAMMOND
     Which means?

     CARTER
     Well, in all likelihood, the Asgard responsible, took the original
     people and replaced them with duplicates so as not to arouse
     suspicion.

     DANIEL
     They studied the original for a period of time and then switched
     them back.

     HAMMOND
     You think whoever took the real Colonel O'Neill is going to return
     him?

     CARTER
     It's all we've got, Sir. We're hoping the fact that Colonel
     O'Neill's clone didn't fully mature is a mistake.

     HAMMOND
     What makes you think that?

     TEAL'C
     The previous actions of the Asgard responsible indicated his desire
     to remain covert.

     DANIEL
     Jack's clone's condition is a dead giveaway.

     CARTER
     So it's a good bet the Asgard doesn't even know there's a problem,
     or else he would have tried to fix it.

     HAMMOND
     Well, they'll figure it out when they try to switch him back.

     CARTER
     If they try to switch.

     HAMMOND
     Are you saying if we don't track down the young duplicate, we may
     not get the real Colonel O'Neill back?

     CARTER
     Well, no, we're sure the Asgard would be able to find him if he
     wants. That's not the real issue.

     TEAL'C
     We wish to apprehend the Asgard responsible.

     DANIEL
     Intercepting the next switch may be our only shot.

   [The phone buzzes. The General pushes a button on the phone.]

     HAMMOND
     Hammond.

     VOICE OVER PHONE
     General Hammond, Sir, I have a Lt. Colonel Beck from the 10th Air
     Base Wing at the Air Force Academy on the line for you. He says it
     has to do with Colonel O'Neill.

     HAMMOND
     Patch him through.

     VOICE OVER PHONE
     Yes, Sir.

   EXT: DAY: STREAM IN A FOREST

   [Young Jack is parked on a boulder, fishing, as Carter, Daniel and
   Teal'c arrive with guards.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Unless you brought beer, that's close enough.

   [Carter turns to the guards and they obediently back off.]

     CARTER

     (yelling to be heard)
     Colonel, we need you to come back with us.

     YOUNG JACK
     How'd you find me?

     DANIEL
     A Lt. Col. Beck called General Hammond and placed you in the area.

     TEAL'C
     A man from whom you recently bought bait said he recommended his
     river.

     YOUNG JACK
     Tell Jacob thanks for trying, but I'm not interested in the
     deep-freeze deal.

     DANIEL
     Look, we're not here to take you to the Tok'ra. There may not be
     much time.

     YOUNG JACK
     Never is, is there?

     DANIEL

     Okay, well.
     (sighs heavily)
     There's no easy way to tell you this so...
     (Carter nods sad agreement)
     Sam's just gonna come right out and say it.

   [Carter shoots him an indignant look.]

     CARTER
     Well, Sir, as you know, the Asgard depend on a cloning technology.

     YOUNG JACK
     Oh, for cryin' out loud!

   [Carter is cringing and Daniel won't meet anyone's eyes.]

     TEAL'C
     You have been cloned, O'Neill.

     YOUNG JACK

     (whipping around)
     What?!!

     DANIEL
     We think the Asgard took the real you and made a copy. An unstable
     one, at that.

     YOUNG JACK
     The real me?

     DANIEL

     (upset)
     Yeah, the original. That's not your real anything. I'm, I'm sorry.

     YOUNG JACK
     Where's the original?

     CARTER
     Well, that's what we hope to find out. But we need your help.

   [Young Jack is floored by this latest revelation.]

   EXT: ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRUCKS ROLLING INTO CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT: SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

     DANIEL
     We've calculated approximately a seven day gap between abductions,
     which puts us at tonight.

     YOUNG JACK
     This plan sucks. Look, I know you don't think I am who I am, but, as
     far as I'm concerned, I am. Who I am.

     CARTER
     The switch is the only chance we have of capturing whoever's behind
     this.

     YOUNG JACK

     What about the fact that this body is dying? I mean, has anyone even
     thought about that for a second?
     (No one responds.)
     Oh, I see. You don't care as long as you get the original back.

     CARTER
     We just, we don't know what else to do for you.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps the Asgard responsible can correct his mistake.

     YOUNG JACK
     Fine. Give me a 9-mil. I'll get it outta the sucker.

     DANIEL
     We don't know who or what we might be facing yet.

     YOUNG JACK

     Exactly why you can't just use me as bait and hang me out to dry.
     You're never gonna intercept one of those Asgard beams. The only
     chance you have of capturing this guy is me.
     (He looks steadily at Hammond, who has been listening intently to
     them all. Appealing:)
     Come on.

     HAMMOND
     A zat gun.

     YOUNG JACK
     Thank you, Sir.

   INT: NIGHT: O'NEILL'S BEDROOM

   [Young Jack is sprawled on the bed, leafing through "Cracked" magazine.
   He picks up a radio from the bedside table.]

     YOUNG JACK

     (into the radio)
     Carter, you still got your ears on?

     CARTER

     (Carter is outside the house observing)
     Yes, Sir.

     YOUNG JACK

     (into the radio)
     Daniel, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     (watching the house from another angle with Daniel)

     Everything appears to be normal, O'Neill.

     YOUNG JACK

     (over the radio)
     Yeah? Not to me.

     CARTER
     You wanna go over the instructions I gave you again?

     YOUNG JACK
     Don't worry, Carter, I'm sure I'll figure it out.

   [An Asgard beam strikes him. Carter sees light flare in O'Neill's
   bedroom and begins to run towards the house. O'Neill is curled up on
   his bed, sleeping deeply and snoring a little. Carter, Daniel and
   Teal'c race into the bedroom.]

     CARTER

     (shaking O'Neill's shoulder)
     Colonel, you all right?

   [No movement from O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Jack! Jack!

   [Still no movement.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill?

   [O'Neill stirs with a grunt.]

     O'NEILL

     (groggy and blinking)
     What are you all doing in my bedroom?

   EXT: SPACE--ASGARD SHIP

   [A small, elegant Asgard ship is in orbit above the Earth]

   INT: ASGARD SHIP

   [Young Jack lies suspended in the air, looking around as an Asgard
   enters the chamber.]

     LOKI
     Hello. Do not be afraid.

   [Young Jack zats the Asgard, which crumples to the ground. Then he
   looks up and zats the orange device keeping him suspended. He plummets
   to the floor, groaning.]

   INT: CUT TO O'NEILL'S BEDROOM

   [O'Neill sits on the edge of his bed, disoriented and rubbing his eyes.
   Eventually, he stands.]

     O'NEILL
     I assume this is, important?

     CARTER
     Just a little, Sir.

   CUT TO ASGARD SHIP

     YOUNG JACK

     Okay.
     (he looks at a sleek console)
     Wrong console.

   [He walks to another, nearby.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Far right jewel thingy, up.

   [He moves a control device to another place on the console and waits
   expectantly but nothing happens.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Ah, and three o'clock.

   [He rotates the controller.]

   CUT TO O'NEILL'S BEDROOM

     O'NEILL
     Y'know, I was having the weirdest dream.

   [SG-1 are beamed from Jack's bedroom aboard the Asgard ship.]

   CUT TO ASGARD SHIP

     YOUNG JACK
     There, you see, Carter? Told you it was no problem.

   [Young Jack walks over to check O'Neill out. They are dressed
   identically, looking each other over in confusion.]

     O'NEILL

     (looks at his teammates)
     What's goin' on?

   [They all look away, embarrassed.]

     YOUNG JACK
     Wow, uh, you know, I'm, I'm really much taller than I think.

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill, meet--Colonel O'Neill.

   [O'Neill looks at Young Jack again, and then back at Carter.]

     O'NEILL

     (irritated and confused)
     What's goin' on?

     DANIEL
     We're pretty sure this Ass-gard over here, kidnapped you and
     attempted to replace you with a clone.

   [Jack is bewildered.]

     O'NEILL
     How long was I asleep?

     CARTER
     Seven days.

     O'NEILL

     That's a record.
     (to Young Jack)
     So you're--me?

     YOUNG JACK

     (simultaneously)
     You. Yeah, uh, believe me, if you think it's weird, imagine how I
     feel being the copy.

   [Loki regains consciousness, moaning piteously.]

     TEAL'C
     He is awakened.

   [Daniel marches over to the Asgard, followed by Carter. Young Jack
   watches them, O'Neill watches him.]

     LOKI

     (confused)
     What's happening?

     CARTER
     We were kind of hoping you could tell us.

     LOKI
     No, no, no, this is all wrong.

     O'NEILL

     Hey!
     (Jack storms over to the Asgard)
     I'll tell you what's wrong. I just woke up, haven't had coffee, let
     alone a pee in seven days, and I find out you stole my ass and made
     a--mini me. Carter, I should be irked currently, yes?

     CARTER
     Yes, I--I would be.

     DANIEL
     Why don't you tell us who you are?

     LOKI
     Loki.

     DANIEL
     According to Norse mythology, that's the god of mischief.

     CARTER
     What did you want with Colonel O'Neill?

     LOKI
     I have nothing more to say to any of you.

     O'NEILL
     Hey! We just saved your flat little white asses from the
     Replicators. This is the thanks we get?

     YOUNG JACK
     Hey, at least you're gonna live.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     YOUNG JACK
     Maybe you're a little put out, but this guy didn't hit all the right
     buttons on the Xerox. This body is gonna fall apart if he doesn't
     fix me.

     LOKI
     I cannot. All the clones suffer the same fate.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, I'm going back to my original question. What's going on?

     LOKI
     I am a scientist, a former geneticist with the Asgard Ruling
     Council.

     CARTER
     Former?

     LOKI
     I was stripped of my stature after I was caught performing
     unsanctioned experiments on humans.

     O'NEILL
     What? You've got sanctioned ones?

     LOKI
     I merely had the courage to do what was necessary to advance our
     cloning technology.

     CARTER
     Instead of courage, some might call it a lack of morality.

     LOKI
     Our population cannot withstand the duplication process for much
     longer.

     CARTER
     Well, how can experimenting on humans change that?

     LOKI
     Your bodies are similar to our original form thousands of years ago.
     Using your physical makeup as a template, I had hoped to find a way
     to construct a clone that could contain our massively superior
     intellect. My research was unsuccessful.

     YOUNG JACK
     So much for massively superior intellect.

     O'NEILL
     I was gonna say that.

     LOKI
     I was going to say, it was unsuccessful prior to my being caught and
     banished. I would have found what I needed eventually.

     DANIEL
     Why risk coming back here and breaking the law after nineteen years?

     LOKI
     Because, I thought he was the one.

     O'NEILL and YOUNG JACK

     (simultaneously)
     Me?

     LOKI
     I believed his genetic code contained the key.

     O'NEILL and YOUNG JACK

     (simultaneously)
     Mine?

     O'NEILL
     Stop it.

     LOKI
     He was physiologically advanced enough to carry and utilize all the
     data from the ancient repository of knowledge. That would not be
     possible for any human one generation ago. He is a significant step
     forward on your evolutionary path.

     DANIEL
     You just found this out recently?

     LOKI
     I learned about it when all the Asgard did. O'Neill is legendary.

   [Daniel, O'Neill and Carter are amazed.]

     LOKI
     Most recently, the Asgard fleet has been distracted by the war with
     the Replicators and the subsequent relocation of our people.

     O'NEILL
     So, you took the opportunity when no one was looking to sneak back
     here.

     LOKI
     I do not regret my actions. I am trying to save my people.

     YOUNG JACK
     Look, I know this isn't all about me, but come on, seriously. I'm
     dying here.

     LOKI
     I cannot reverse your fate. Nor can I explain why you did not mature
     to the proper age as you should have.

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, easy to see why they kicked you out of the science club.

     O'NEILL

     All right, I've heard enough.
     (He returns to the control console.)
     Carter,
     (Carter follows)
     Can you call Thor on this thing?

   [Carter walks to the console Young Jack used to beam them up.]

     LOKI
     Please, do not.

     CARTER
     We've already tried contacting the Asgard a number of times.

     YOUNG JACK
     You know, you'd think if Thor knew about this?

     CARTER
     Okay, pretty sure that's it.

   [Everyone waits. And waits.]

     YOUNG JACK
     All right, how long are we go--

   [He stumbles slightly, closing his eyes as if giddy.]

     O'NEILL
     You all right?

     YOUNG JACK
     Actually, no.

     DANIEL

     Uh, what do we do if Thor doesn't show up?
     (Thor beams aboard the ship)
     Never mind.

     O'NEILL
     Well, it's about time!

     THOR

     (as he walks to where Loki is restrained)
     I apologize for not coming sooner. Loki, what have you done?

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah, it seems he's been playing Dr. Moreau behind your back.

     O'NEILL
     Yes! Dr. Moreau!

     THOR
     You know why I am here. You should have known O'Neill's genetic code
     was safeguarded for his own protection.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     THOR
     A marker was placed in your DNA to prevent any attempts at genetic
     manipulation.

     DANIEL
     The abnormality?

     CARTER
     That's why the clone didn't mature.

   [Thor walks across to Young Jack and O'Neill.]

     THOR
     Yes. Loki will be punished for his actions.

     CARTER
     Is it true that Colonel O'Neill is the key to solving your cloning
     problems?

     THOR
     No.

     O'NEILL

     (whining)
     But I thought I was advanced?

     THOR
     Indeed, you are O'Neill, but our scientists have already determined
     that while you are an important step forward in the evolutionary
     chain, the missing link we have been searching for still eludes us.

     O'NEILL

     I'm sorry. THOR
     Again, I apologize for any inconvenience Loki may have caused.

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah, that's what I'd call it.

     THOR
     Unfortunately, the eventual genetic breakdown of the clone is not my
     doing, but rather a result of Loki's inept methods.

     LOKI
     There was no need for the clones to survive.

   [O'Neill looks at Young Jack, who is horrified by being written off
   this way. O'Neill feels for him.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, Thor? Is there anything you can do for him? The whining's
     starting to grate.

     THOR

     (amazed)
     You wish your clone to live?

     YOUNG JACK
     You can't just let me die!

     O'NEILL
     He's just a kid.

     THOR
     Are you certain, O'Neill?

   [O'Neill doesn't answer immediately and Young Jack smacks him in the
   arm.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm thinking! Yeah.

     THOR
     Very well. I will attempt to repair his DNA. If successful, he
     should continue to mature at a normal human rate.

   [Everyone reacts with relief at this news.]

     O'NEILL
     Thanks.

   [Thor bows.]

   EXT: DAY: COLORADO SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL

   [O'Neill's truck pulls up in front of the school. Young Jack is in the
   passenger seat. A song is playing loudly--"A Melancholy Day"]

     O'NEILL
     You're sure about this?

   [Jack obviously is not.]

     YOUNG JACK
     I've thought a lot about it. And, you know, you, me, I mean, we,
     never really did embrace high school. I don't know. Haven't you ever
     just wanted to go back and do it all over again? I mean, especially
     with all you know now?

     O'NEILL

     (absolute certainty)
     No.

     YOUNG JACK
     Well, from here on in, you and me are different. Which is why I'm
     gonna do this.

   [He gets out of the truck but pauses when O'Neill calls out to him.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, listen, do me a favour, huh?

     YOUNG JACK
     Don't worry, I, I wasn't gonna keep in touch.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, it'd just be a little--

     YOUNG JACK
     Weird.

     O'NEILL
     Weird, yeah.

     YOUNG JACK
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     But look, if you need anything, just, you know?

     YOUNG JACK
     Air Force has set me up, I'll be fine.

     O'NEILL
     You're sure about this? I mean, it's high school.

   [Young Jack turns and sees three girls eyeing him. They giggle to each
   other when he looks at them. Then he turns and fixes O'Neill with a
   significant look.]

     O'NEILL

     (enlightenment dawns)
     Yes! Go forth, young man!

   [Young Jack pulls out a pair of really cool sunglasses and puts them
   on, pats the side of the truck as the song swells, "Who am I? Who am
   I?"]

   [O'Neill smiles and drives away, leaving Young Jack alone. He turns
   immediately, catches up with the giggling girls and walks towards the
   school.]

   FADE OUT

Lily Frost, "Who Am I" song lyrics

   Today, on the street
   In the metro,
   It's a melancholy day
   No one speaks
   Passing you by
   Wondering why

   Today, like any day
   Rolled out of bed
   Talked on the telephone
   Went to the doctor, she said
   You're OK
   Still I wonder

   Who am I

   Today in the air
   On the water
   Ships pass you by
   Clouds fantasize
   Dragging shapes across the sky
   Wondering why

   Who am I

   Clarion plays for the courtsmans brigade
   Centuries before on this very stage
   Gypsies serenade, passed through DNA
   So it found its way

   Today in the air
   On the metro
   It's a melancholy day
