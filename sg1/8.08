   INT--OFFICE

     VOGLER
     Once you walk through that door, there's no turning back.

     COLSON
     Oh, I understand, Brian. I'm not having any doubts.

   [Vogler and Colson walk through the office. Colson picks up a jacket
   and puts it on.]

     VOGLER
     Alec, it is not just your credibility at stake here.

     COLSON
     You're right, there. It's the leaders of the democratic free world
     should be worried.

   [Colson walks into an elevator.]

     VOGLER
     Think about the people who work for this company. The shareholders.

     COLSON
     I am, Brian. They have a right to know the truth, as does everybody
     else.

   [Vogler joins Colson in the elevator.]

     COLSON
     Trust me, we're doing the right thing.

   [The doors close.]

   INT--PRESS CONFERENCE

   [A large number of reporters and cameramen are gathered in the room.
   Colson enters, acknowledging people and shaking hands. He and Vogler
   step up to a podium where a number of microphones are set up.]

     COLSON
     Thank you all for coming. As you all know, about five months ago our
     planet suffered a horrible tragedy. Over two thousand American
     servicemen and women were killed when a meteor shower disrupted
     global communications and hit a United States Naval Carrier Group on
     manoeuvres in the Pacific Ocean. I'm here today to challenge the
     facts of that incident as they've been conveyed to the general
     public.

   [The people present murmur, surprised at Colson's speech.]

   INT--SGC DANIEL'S LAB

   [Daniel is watching the press conference on television.]

     COLSON
     On the day in question, none of our satellites detected a meteor
     shower.

   [Carter enters.]

     CARTER
     Hey, what's going on?

     DANIEL
     Shh, sh, sh.

   [Carter leans on the desk, watching the television.]

     COLSON
     Now, I don't know how many governments around the world are in on
     this, but I do know we are being lied to and the truth is being
     covered up.

     CARTER
     Oh, oh.

   [Carter looks at Daniel as he grimaces.]

     COLSON
     Ladies and gentlemen. There is life beyond our world. There are
     aliens out there and they have a technology far beyond ours and they
     have been intervening in our existence for quite some time.

   [Daniel and Carter look at each other.]

     COLSON
     I have proof, and I am giving the governments of all the nations
     that are aware of this, 24 hours to reveal the truth...or I'm gonna
     do it for them. Thank you.

   [Colson leaves the podium.]

     DANIEL
     Well. There you go.

   [Daniel smiles mirthlessly.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are watching a TV report by Julia Donovan
   about Colson.]

     DONOVAN
     For those of you living on another planet for the past 20 years,
     Alec Colson, age 42. Net worth, over sixty billion dollars, runs a
     global empire of companies including communications, biotechnology,
     aerospace and aviation. He's number eight on the Fortune 500.

   [O'Neill enters the briefing room.]

     REPORTER
     He personally holds over 200 proprietary patents in both the
     military and domestic industries.

     O'NEILL
     Shut it off.

   [Carter turns off the television.]

     O'NEILL

     We know who he is.
     (to Carter, pointedly)
     Some of us better than others.

     CARTER
     We worked together briefly, sir. Colson Aviation developed the multi
     engine control systems for the F-302s. Colson didn't know what they
     were for, of course, but he is a brilliant engineer.

     O'NEILL
     He's also a little nuts, isn't he?

     CARTER
     You've test flown experimental aircraft.

     DANIEL
     We all go through the gate.

     O'NEILL
     This isn't about us.

     DANIEL
     Well, in a way, it is.

     CARTER
     The point is, sir, he's not some looney cult leader. People are
     taking him seriously.

     O'NEILL
     So, what do we think he knows?

   [O'Neill opens a file containing a photograph of Colson, in flying
   gear.]

     CARTER
     He owns several Earth observer and weather satellites. Maybe it's
     possible they picked something up. Pictures of Anubis' fleet in
     orbit, or the battle over Antarctica.

     DANIEL
     What I don't understand is how it could have come this far.

   [O'Neill reads from the file.]

     O'NEILL
     He's gotten the National Security speech from the Pentagon, several
     times. Apparently the President has called him personally.

     TEAL'C
     Why not merely tell him the truth?

     CARTER
     His personality was profiled and he was deemed a security risk.

     O'NEILL
     For obvious reasons.

     DANIEL
     Apparently his father was a newspaper reporter who was jailed during
     the McCarthy era. He believes pretty strongly in the freedom of
     speech and the rights of the people to know what the government is
     doing at all times.

     CARTER
     Leaking classified information could be considered treason.

     O'NEILL
     Alright, see if he can be convinced not to go public.

     DANIEL
     Without actually telling him anything?

     O'NEILL
     Right!

   [O'Neill walks into his office.]

   EXT--COLSON INDUSTRIES BUILDING

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

     VOGLER
     We've got all the major networks, over a dozen live radio broadcasts
     and reporters from newspapers, both legit and tabloids, all waiting
     for the next shooter draft.

     COLSON
     Brian, calm down!

     VOGLER
     Our stock price is trading down twenty five percent. We overextended
     ourselves competing for that last round of contracts. That stock
     price is the only thing covering our debt. And you are alienating
     our biggest client. We're going to have to start selling off assets,
     just to...

   [Colson pours himself a drink.]

     COLSON
     What does that matter, Brian? Given what we know?

     VOGLER
     I don't know, I guess I'm just trying to hold on to some shred of
     reality.

     COLSON
     Well, you, along with everyone else, are going to have to start
     dealing with a whole new reality from now on.

     VOGLER
     What if the world can't handle it? What if Washington's right and we
     should just keep this thing in the bag?

     COLSON
     Trust me. The truth is always right.

   [Vogler sighs.]

     VOGLER
     We've already caused mass hysteria. You have no idea how much chaos
     this could cause.

   [A woman enters the room.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Alec. They're here.

     COLSON
     Oh, show them in, would you?

   [He hands Brian the drink and slaps him on the arm.]

     COLSON
     It'll be okay.

   [Carter and Daniel enter.]

     COLSON
     Lieutenant Colonel.

   [He and Carter shake hands.]

     CARTER
     Alec.

     COLSON
     Radiant as ever.

   [Daniel reaches forward to shake Colson's hand.]

     DANIEL
     Daniel Jackson

     COLSON
     Oh Doc! I'm a big fan.

     DANIEL
     Really?

     COLSON
     Yes, I've been following you since your early career. Pyramids as
     landing pads for alien ships? Fascinating.

     DANIEL
     Uh, yeah, that was a long time ago.

     COLSON
     Yeah, what have you been up to since? It's like you just dropped off
     the map.

     DANIEL
     I've been around.

   [Vogler walks up behind Colson.]

     COLSON
     Ah. Oh, I beg your pardon. May I introduce Brian Vogler.

     CARTER
     Thank you for seeing us today.

     COLSON
     Well, shall we?

   [Colson walks further into the room towards a sofa and television.]

     COLSON
     Why don't we start with something I'm sure we can all agree on,
     hmmm?

   [Vogler, Carter and Daniel follow Colson, who turns on the television.]

     COLSON
     That meteor shower was a cover story, and a surprisingly weak one at
     that. Although under the circumstances, I'm not so sure I'd have
     come up with a better one.

     CARTER
     What makes you say that?

   [Colson shows a recording of Anubis' fleet in orbit over Earth,
   followed by images of a space battle and finally, the Prometheus.
   Daniel and Carter look uncomfortable.]

     COLSON

     (pointing to the screen)
     Oh! I'm guessing that's one of ours?

     VOGLER
     We lost contact with twelve communications and weather mapping
     satellites for over six hours on the day in question. When we got
     them back online they were able to transmit images stored in the
     buffers.

     CARTER
     Images like these can be faked.

     COLSON
     Or made to seem fake. I know why you're here, Sam.

   [Colson walks up to Carter and Daniel.]

     COLSON
     The Pentagon wants me to know that people like you are going to be
     trying to make me look like a fraud.

     CARTER
     People like me?

     COLSON
     Very smart people. Oh, we have more than this.

   [Colson gestures to the television.]

     COLSON
     Now obviously, I don't know everything but I do have a right to. As
     does everyone else.

     CARTER
     Anything we can say to stop you?

     VOGLER
     Believe me, I've tried.

   EXT--COLSON INDUSTRIES BUILDING

   [Carter and Daniel leave the building. Carter's mobile rings.]

     CARTER

     (into phone)
     Carter.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

     DONOVAN

     (into phone)
     Sam, it's Julia Donovan.

   EXT--COLSON INDUSTRIES BUILDING

     CARTER
     How did you get this number?

     DONOVAN
     I have my sources. Our camera track just caught you and a nice
     looking young man going into Colson Industries head office in
     Seattle an hour ago. I just saw the feed.

   [Donovan is speaking quietly, obviously not wanting anyone to overhear
   her.]

     CARTER
     And?

     DONOVAN
     Just wondering if you had an official comment.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I think your coverage is a little one sided.

     DONOVAN
     Come on, Sam. Colson's going to out the whole operation. You don't
     really think Washington can contain this?

     CARTER
     We'll see. Look, I don't have to remind you about the non disclosure
     agreement you signed, do I?

     CARTER

     (To Daniel)
     It's the reporter from the Prometheus incident.

     DONOVAN
     Colson doesn't seem to be worried about going to jail.

     CARTER
     Yeah, well, he hasn't done anything illegal yet.

   [Daniel and Carter get into a red sports car. Daniel is checking his
   mobile.]

     DONOVAN
     We had an agreement. You said that if something big was going to
     break you would call me first.

     CARTER

     I will, okay?
     (Carter closes the phone)
     Bye, bye.

     DANIEL
     I've got thirteen messages from Emmett Bregman.

   [Carter sighs.]

   INT--COLSON INDUSTRIES OFFICES

     FEMALE STAFFER
     The switchboard's been jammed ever since the press conference. Every
     crackpot in the world is calling.

     COLSON
     Yeah, I've arranged security for all of you and your families.

   [Colson, the woman, Vogler and a man are walking along the corridors.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Do you really think we need to be worried?

     COLSON
     I'd be more worried about the things we still don't know at this
     point.

     VOGLER
     I'm trying to convince him it's not too late.

     COLSON
     It is too late, Brian. Too late for the world to know there was a
     large scale alien attack against our planet which was barely
     thwarted. Too late for the general public to realise they've been
     lied to, by two different elected administrations, about the very
     nature of our existence.

     FEMALE STAFFER
     So, we're going public with everything.

     COLSON
     I was really hoping the Feds would come clean.

     VOGLER
     I can't believe Washington hasn't done more to try and stop us. Some
     sort of legal injunction.

     COLSON
     That would legitimise our claims. No, no, they're obviously going to
     try to play this as if we can't be taken seriously.

     FEMALE STAFFER
     We're one of the largest corporations in the world.

     COLSON
     And we're telling the truth.

     VOGLER

     (frustrated)
     Alec! It doesn't matter who we are, or how right we are. They can
     stop us if they really want to.

     COLSON
     Oh, come on, Brian, what are they gonna do, hmm?

   [Colson slaps Vogler on both arms.]

     COLSON
     Have me killed?

   [Colson walks into his office. Vogler is obviously concerned.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel, Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c are watching Donovan's report on
   Colson.]

     CARTER
     Well, he's gotta have something more significant than pictures.

     DANIEL
     I'm going over government contracts assigned to Colson's companies
     over the last few years. I haven't got through them all yet, but
     there's quite a few loosely related to R and D of alien technologies
     that we procured offworld.

   [O'Neill turns the up the television.]

     DONOVAN
     We'll now head to Colson Industries.

   [The television shows Colson holding another press conference.]

     COLSON
     Welcome, and thank you for coming.

   [Carter looks at her watch.]

     CARTER
     24 hours to the minute.

   INT--PRESS CONFERENCE

     COLSON
     Yesterday, I told you of our belief in the existence of intelligent
     life beyond our planet. I also told you that we believe several
     governments, including our own, have known about this and have been
     concealing the information for quite some time now. Yesterday, I
     challenged those governments to come clean. Reveal the truth. We got
     only silence. Which gives me no choice but to present to you what
     evidence I have. How do I know for sure that alien life really does
     exist? Ladies and gentlemen, seeing is believing.

   [Colson gestures to the back of the room. The reporters turn as an
   Asgard is brought into the room. Cameras flash as the Asgard stands,
   seemingly nervous and upset.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill turns from the television to face SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, I'd call that something.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

   [Donovan is making a news report, a recording of the Asgard on a screen
   behind her.]

     DONOVAN
     The world is in a frenzy after yesterday's startling revelation of
     what appeared to be a live alien, by billionaire industrialist, Alec
     Colson. Thus far there's been no official statement from the White
     House and sources inside Colson Industries promise that there is
     definitely more to come.

   INT--SGC DANIEL'S LAB

   [Carter is on the phone. Daniel is reading a report.]

     CARTER

     (into phone)
     Okay. Thank you, Sergeant.

   [She puts down the phone.]

     CARTER
     Well, we just got a message back from Thor. As far as he knows there
     are no Asgard currently on Earth.

     DANIEL
     Loki was here for years conducting experiments without the High
     Council knowing about it.

     CARTER
     Okay, here's a possibility. What if...it wasn't really an Asgard?

   [Daniel looks at Carter.]

     DANIEL
     Looked like one.

     CARTER
     Didn't sound like one.

     DANIEL
     Didn't say anything.

     CARTER
     That's my point. Colson wrapped things up pretty quickly without
     taking any questions.

     DANIEL
     It was a perfect likeness.

     CARTER
     Imagery of little grey aliens has been commonplace on Earth for
     years. For that matter, Colson could have a picture.

     DANIEL
     So not a real Asgard?

     CARTER
     No Asgard we know would allow himself to be used that way.

     DANIEL
     It did look a little vacant.

     CARTER
     Still, as much as he wants the whole truth I don't think Colson
     would perpetrate a hoax to get it.

     DANIEL
     Then what was it?

     CARTER
     I don't know.

   INT--COLSON INDUSTRIES OFFICES

     VOGLER
     The networks all want interviews.

   [Colson, the woman and Vogler are walking through the offices.]

     COLSON
     Too bad our friend can't talk.

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Well, we know he's capable. The MRI show larynx not too different
     from ours. But he doesn't seem to have anything to say.

     VOGLER
     They also want full access for independent medical and scientific
     personnel to verify that it's really what we say it is.

     FEMALE STAFFER
     How are we supposed to convince the world of alien intelligence when
     this guy doesn't seem to have any?

     VOGLER
     We can't just trot this thing out on television with wild claims we
     aren't going to be able to back up. Granted, it's an amazing genetic
     experiment, but we don't even know that the thing is really alien.

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

   [They enter the office.]

     COLSON
     What else could it be?

     FEMALE STAFFER
     All we know is that the DNA came from the Department of Defence.

     COLSON
     Look, we're trying to build a circumstantial case here. The more
     questions we can raise, the more the burden of proof is gonna shift
     to Washington. Sooner or later, they're gonna have to respond to the
     public pressure. Meanwhile, we stay quiet. The media's going nuts
     over this whole thing. So, let's just sit tight and see what
     happens.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill is sitting at the table as Daniel, Carter and Teal'c enter.]

     DANIEL
     Well, Sam was right. There's something different about Colson's
     Asgard.

   [Daniel, Carter and Teal'c sit at the table.]

     DANIEL
     Seems that a Colson biotech research company was given a copy of
     Asgard DNA for sequencing.

     CARTER
     We were trying to help with their cloning problem.

     O'NEILL
     Colson grew a clone?

     DANIEL
     They weren't told it was alien DNA, it was meant to be a blind
     study. But they obviously took their research a little further than
     the contract specified.

     CARTER
     Asgard DNA is programmed to grow a clone to maturity in just three
     months. But they're essentially an empty shell until an existing
     consciousness can be transferred into them.

     TEAL'C
     It did not speak because it was not capable.

     CARTER
     Exactly. They probably spent what time they had with it teaching it
     how to walk.

     O'NEILL
     Well, the Pentagon has lost all patience.

     DANIEL
     What are they gonna do?

     O'NEILL
     They want us to put a stop to it.

     CARTER
     How?

     O'NEILL
     We're calling in a marker.

   [O'Neill smiles as the others look confused. O'Neill looks at his
   watch, obviously waiting for something to happen.]

     O'NEILL
     Yep, calling in a marker.

   [O'Neill looks around, just as Thor beams in to the room.]

     THOR
     Greetings.

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

   [The female staffer strides through the corridor.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Excuse me!

   [She enters Colson's office.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     It's gone.

     COLSON
     What do you mean?

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Just disappeared right out of the lab. The alien! Computers,
     everything.

     COLSON
     How? What about security?

   [Colson stands, agitated.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Nobody took it. It disappeared. We were standing right there, there
     was a bright flash of light, and it was all just gone.

   [Colson reaches for his jacket.]

     COLSON
     Alright, have Ron send out the decoy car and get the plane ready for
     a trip to Washington. Have it ready by the time I get to the hangar.

   [Colson leaves as the woman turns to pick up the phone.]

   INT--TV STUDIOES

     DONOVAN
     You ready?

   [Donovan is sitting behind a desk. Carter, in dress blues, is sitting
   beside her being fitted with a microphone.]

     CARTER
     Not really.

     DONOVAN
     Just try not to think about the camera. Focus on me.

     CARTER
     It's not that. I respect Alec Colson. I don't like being asked to
     discredit a man who has every right to want the truth.

     DONOVAN
     But you've been ordered to do this.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     DONOVAN
     Well, if you want to go against those orders, feel free. I'll go
     with it.

   [Theme music begins as the countdown to going on air begins.]

     DIRECTOR

     (over intercom)
     In five, four, three, two...

   [Donovan is presenting the show.]

     DONOVAN

     We're here with Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the United
     States Air Force.
     (to Carter)
     Welcome.

     CARTER
     Thank you.

     DONOVAN
     Your background is astrophysics and you're one of the military's
     leading scientific researchers. We're all very eager to finally hear
     some reaction from Washington regarding the revelation made by Alec
     Colson.

     CARTER
     Well, first of all, I can assure people that if aliens really
     existed, and were visiting the planet, we would know about it.

     DONOVAN
     So, are you saying his claims have no merit? We all saw an alien on
     live television.

     CARTER
     Yes, well, Hollywood's been helping us see things on TV, for a long
     time now.

     DONOVAN
     Are you saying that the alien wasn't real?

     CARTER
     It depends on what you mean by real.

   INT--COLSON'S VEHICLE

   [Colson and Vogler are watching the interview on a small screen in the
   rear of the car.]

     COLSON
     Notice she hasn't actually lied once.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

     CARTER
     I can show you some advanced methods for creating realistic 3D
     images that we've been working on.

     DONOVAN
     By all means.

     CARTER
     We've been experimenting with technology that makes it possible for
     us to create anything you can imagine. Virtually.

   [Carter turns to the side as a hologram of an Asgard appears next to
   her.]

   INT--COLSON'S VEHICLE

   [Colson and Vogler look surprised as they see the image of the Asgard
   on the screen.]

     DONOVAN
     Wow, that looks just like the alien Alec Colson introduced to us.

     ASGARD
     Greetings, people of Earth.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

     DONOVAN
     That's amazing. He looks so real.

     ASGARD
     Though I look real, I have been created through the use of advanced
     holographic technology.

     DONOVAN
     That's just incredible.

   [Carter waves her hand through the hologram, making the image flicker.]

     CARTER
     It's just a projection. You'll probably be seeing technology like
     this in theme park rides in a few years.

   INT--COLSON'S VEHICLE

     COLSON
     Oh, she's good.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

   [The interview has ended. Donovan is reviewing the tape of the Asgard.]

     DONOVAN
     Not quite the exclusive I had in mind, but it'll still do huge
     numbers.

     CARTER
     You're hilarious. After everything you've been through you still
     care about ratings.

     DONOVAN
     How did you do it? I've seen visual effects before, Sam, and this
     was some sort of...

   [Donovan is handed a message.]

     DONOVAN
     ...some sort of alien technology, wasn't it?

   [Donovan reads the message, frowning.]

     CARTER
     What is it?

     DONOVAN

     Ten minutes ago, Alec Colson's private plane was forced into an
     emergency landing after almost crashing on take off from Sea-Tac.
     The plane suffered sudden depressurisation and loss of engine power
     but was able to land without serious incident. Excuse me, Sam, I've
     gotta get on the air with this.
     (to staffers)
     I need something on Colson's wife and his daughter. They died in a
     plane crash when he was twenty four.
     (to Carter)
     That's why he started Colson Aviation.
     (to staff)
     Let's go!

   [Carter's mobile rings.]

     CARTER

     (into phone)
     Carter.

     COLSON

     (over phone)
     Sam?

   INT--COLSON'S VEHICLE

     COLSON
     It's Alec Colson.

   INT--TV STUDIOES

   [Carter looks around and walks away from Donovan and other staff. She
   speaks quietly into the phone.]

     CARTER
     Are you okay?

     COLSON
     News travels fast. It was close. Brian's still as white as a sheet.

   INT--COLSON'S VEHICLE

   [Vogler joins Colson in the back of the car and makes himself a drink.]

   INT--TV STUDIOES

     CARTER
     How did you get this number?

     COLSON
     Oh, I have my sources. You know, the ground crew here found evidence
     the plane had been tampered with.

   [Vogler prepares himself a drink.]

     CARTER
     Someone tried to kill you?

     COLSON
     Seems that way. Any ideas?

     CARTER
     You think I know? Why would I go on TV to publicly discredit you if
     I knew you were about to be assassinated?

     COLSON
     To make sure it didn't look like Washington had anything to do with
     it. A fine job you did too, by the way.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, I was following orders.

     COLSON
     Yeah, I know. Don't worry, Sam. I don't believe for a second you
     were in on it. If it was our government I'm sure you were just a
     pawn.

     CARTER
     That doesn't make me feel any better. Look, Alec, I can assure you
     that...

     COLSON
     It's okay, it's okay, it wasn't my first rough landing, I'm sure it
     won't be my last. I won't be stopped, Sam. I promise you, one way or
     another, the world is gonna learn the truth.

   [Colson ends the call.]

   INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill is sitting behind his desk.]

     O'NEILL
     Um, how about a hyperdrive for the Prometheus?

   [Thor and Daniel are sitting in front of the desk. Daniel is making
   notes.]

     THOR
     That is something I must discuss with the High Council.

     O'NEILL
     Thor, come on! You said you wanted to get something nice for the
     President.

   [Carter enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     Sir, anything on who might have tried to kill Colson?

     O'NEILL
     It wasn't us.

     DANIEL
     We think that Colson may have fragments of downed Goa'uld ships
     recovered from the Antarctic. A subsidiary of his was involved in
     the salvage and the clean up.

     CARTER
     Are we just going to keep trying to discredit the man? I mean,
     aren't we the ones a little delusional to think that we could cover
     up an attack of this scale?

     O'NEILL
     What's the alternative?

     CARTER
     How about tell the truth?

   [Daniel and Thor look at Carter, surprised. Daniel and O'Neill look at
   each other, puzzled.]

     CARTER
     I mean to Colson. Look, I know he's been profiled and deemed a
     security risk and obviously that's an accurate assessment but what
     have we got to lose at this point? He's already trying to go public,
     let's show him why it's so important to keep the secret. Besides,
     think of the benefits of having a man with his resources on our
     side.

     O'NEILL
     Well, Thor and I are meeting with the President in five minutes.
     I'll bring it up.

     CARTER
     Five minutes?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

   [O'Neill grins at Thor, as they are both beamed away.]

     CARTER
     Right.

   [She looks at Daniel, who just shrugs.]

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

     COLSON
     Two o'clock, we go live. With the pictures, pieces of the alien
     ship, everything we've got.

     VOGLER
     Alec! They tried to kill us!

     COLSON
     You think that didn't work in our favour?

     VOGLER

     (loudly)
     Dying doesn't work in our favour!

   [Suddenly, Colson is beamed out of the office. Vogler and the female
   staffer stand in shock.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Colson materialises in the room, with Thor. As Colson sees Thor, he
   steps back in shock.]

     COLSON
     Okay. What just happened?

   [Carter and Daniel walk towards them.]

     DANIEL
     Well, in layman's terms, we beamed you up and then down again.

     COLSON
     Where am I?

     CARTER
     Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado. You know Daniel, of course.

   [Colson and Daniel shake hands.]

     COLSON
     Yeah, hi.

   [Carter gestures to Thor.]

     CARTER
     And this is Thor.

     THOR
     Greetings.

     COLSON
     Ah, so this is a real one.

     CARTER
     Yep.

     COLSON
     What happened to the clone?

     THOR
     It will become a host to an Asgard consciousness whose physical body
     is failing.

     COLSON
     Okay.

     THOR
     Now, I must take my leave. General O'Neill said he will see you all
     tomorrow.

   [Thor is beamed away.]

     COLSON
     Huh...wha?

     CARTER
     I want to show you something.

   [Carter opens the blast doors at the window, to show the Stargate.
   Colson comes to stand next to her.]

     CARTER
     We call it a Stargate.

   INT--SGC VIP ROOM

   [Colson is on the phone.]

     COLSON
     I'm okay, Brian. I promise you, I'm fine. I'll be back in a couple
     of days.

   [There is a knock at the door.]

     COLSON
     I've got to go. Alright, bye.

   [Colson puts down the phone as Carter enters the room.]

     CARTER
     Ready?

     COLSON
     Wow! Look at you.

     CARTER
     Yeah, soldier Sam.

     COLSON
     I get a uniform too?

     CARTER
     Yep.

   [Carter throws a bundled up uniform to Colson.]

     COLSON
     Alright!

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The gate is dialling out. Colson enters, joining Carter at the base of
   the ramp. As the Stargate activates, Colson steps back as the event
   horizon whooshes out. Carter smiles and starts up the ramp.]

     COLSON
     Whoa! So, where are we going?

   [Colson follows Carter onto the ramp.]

     CARTER
     P4X-650. We have an offworld base there.

     COLSON
     And how far away is that?

     CARTER
     640 light years.

   [They stop at the event horizon.]

     COLSON
     Really?

     CARTER
     Let's go.

   [They walk through the gate, and travel through the wormhole.]

   INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM

   [They step out of the gate into a large building. Colson looks at the
   gate as it shuts down. He looks at Carter in amazement.]

     COLSON
     Didn't feel a thing.

     CARTER
     You were de-molecularised.

   [An officer walks up to them.]

     CAPTAIN
     Welcome to the Alpha site.

   [Colson and Carter step down from the Stargate platform.]

     CARTER
     Alec Colson. Captain Sheffield.

   [Colson and Sheffield shake hands.]

     COLSON
     Well it's...it's nice.

     CARTER
     Our last Alpha site was destroyed in an attack. We decided to build
     this one inside a mountain, like the SGC.

     SHEFFIELD
     This is all a bit spartan but it's our home away from home.

     COLSON
     I guess I was just expecting something a little more, I don't know,
     otherworldly?

   [Carter opens blast doors, to show an F-302 in a hangar. Colson steps
   into the hangar, but stops in amazement.]

     COLSON
     Now that...that's more like it.

     CARTER
     It's called the F-302. Alien-human hybrid.

   [They walk towards the aircraft.]

     COLSON
     So this is what the MECs were for?

     CARTER
     Yeah, thanks to you it's capable of leaving the atmosphere and
     returning. We used a number of these to defend Earth five months
     ago.

   [Colson reaches up to touch the aircraft.]

     CARTER
     This is just one of the many advancements we've made as a result of
     technology procured through the Stargate. You wanna take a ride?

   [Colson smiles and nods.]

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

   [Vogler is in the office, standing at a terminal with a disc in his
   hand. The woman, noticing that he is there, enters.]

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Brian, what are you doing?

     VOGLER
     Alec wants all the evidence that we have about the alien cover-up
     duplicated, and secured off premises. You can get started on
     whatever we have left on the clone research.

     FEMALE STAFFER
     Okay.

   [The woman leaves just as Vogler's mobile rings. Vogler check that
   no-one is in the office, then answers it.]

     VOGLER

     (into phone)
     Vogler. I told you, I don't know where he is. I have a meeting with
     the SEC this afternoon. I understand. Don't worry, it'll work.

   [Vogler, looking worried, ends the call.]

   INT--ALPHA SITE HANGAR

   [The F-302 leaves the hangar.]

   INT--F-302

   [Carter is flying the plane, with Colson in the rear seat.]

     COLSON
     Beautiful.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     COLSON
     Must be hard, keeping all this secret. I don't know how you do it.

     CARTER
     I think of all the fear it would cause, the potential chaos.

     COLSON
     Ah, but what about all the greater meaning you could bring to
     people's lives? Just knowing that all this is out here.

     CARTER
     What's out here is an enemy so advanced, so evil, it's a miracle we
     haven't been wiped out or enslaved yet. We've been very lucky so
     far. I think most people would have a hard time living with the
     threat of constant impending doom.

     COLSON
     Oh, right, the old if you had cancer argument. Would you want to
     know you were gonna die, or would you rather live out your final
     days in blissful ignorance?

     CARTER
     Yeah, I guess I don't really buy it either.

     COLSON
     Well, I'd rather know, and try to cure it. If I couldn't do that,
     then I'd try to make my final days as meaningful as possible.

     CARTER
     You want a turn?

     COLSON
     I thought I was going to have to ask.

     CARTER
     Switching to co-pilot control. Go ahead, she's all yours.

   [Colson takes control of the aircraft and flies into a roll.]

     CARTER
     So, what do you think?

     COLSON
     Amazing! She manoeuvres like an F/A-22, and feels like a 747.

   [Carter nods in agreement.]

     CARTER
     That's the inertial dampeners.

     COLSON
     Alright, let's try this.

   [He dives the plane sharply to the ground. A number of alarms start
   ringing and a main engine rocket fuel warning flashes.]

     CARTER
     Alec! Alec, pull up!

   [Carter takes control of the plane and, as the aircraft skims treetops,
   she pulls it up.]

     ALPHA CONTROL

     (over radio)
     Flight, this is Alpha Command. Is everything okay up there?

     CARTER
     It is now, we're fine. Bringing her back in.

   [Carter shakes her head and sighs.]

   INT--ALPHA SITE HANGAR

   [The plane is brought into the hangar. Carter and Colson take off their
   helmets as the cockpit cover slides open.]

     CARTER
     Well, that was reckless.

     COLSON
     Ah, the 302 can handle it. I know. I may not have known its name but
     I helped you build it, remember?

     CARTER
     It was a joy ride. I took you up for a little fun.

   [Carter steps out of her seat.]

     COLSON
     This isn't a game, Sam! What you guys are doing up here? This is
     life and death, for all of us.

     CARTER
     We know that.

     COLSON
     It wasn't much fun feeling out of control like that, was it?

     CARTER
     You don't have to make your point with my life.

     COLSON
     Oh, come on! We were never gonna crash. Unlike my plane back on
     Earth.

     CARTER
     I told you. We had nothing to do with it.

     COLSON
     Yeah, well, someone did. And if you think that, or any of this, is
     gonna prevent me from telling the world what they have a right to
     know. You're dead wrong.

   INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM

   [Colson is studying the Stargate. Carter steps up on to the platform.]

     CARTER
     Alec. There's something else I need to talk to you about. There's a
     clandestine group of private businessmen like yourself who were
     informed of the Stargate program over six years ago by rogue
     elements of the NID. We've tried to identify them and bring them
     down but they are very highly connected. Former Vice President
     Kinsey's been linked to them. Now, instead of going public like you,
     they've been funding various secret endeavours, all aimed at
     controlling alien technology for their own purposes.

     COLSON
     Which are?

     CARTER
     You'd have to ask them. Personal profit. Maybe they think they can
     do a better job of defending the planet than we can.

     COLSON
     Why are you telling me all this?

     CARTER
     Because I'm guessing that's who tried to kill you. They'll never get
     control of the gate if the world finds out.

   [Carter and Colson sit at the top of the platform steps.]

     COLSON
     When I was young, all I ever dreamed about was flying. I had every
     make of aeroplane ever built hanging from my ceiling. And
     then...well, I take it you know about my wife and daughter.

   [Carter nods.]

     COLSON
     One of the down sides of celebrity. We really do have no secrets.
     Anyway, after the crash I vowed to make flying as safe as it
     possibly could be. I really thought that I could do it better than
     anyone else.

     CARTER
     But you have made a difference.

     COLSON
     But nothing's perfect, is it?

     CARTER
     No.

     COLSON
     Intergalactic travel. Advanced alien civilisations, humans living on
     other worlds? I do realise that there may be bad guys out there too.

     CARTER
     You have no idea how bad.

     COLSON
     But in the end, we have to believe in humanity. I mean, who knows,
     this might bring us all together as a planet.

     CARTER
     If we knew it would play out that way, then....

     COLSON
     You're afraid that knowing about the Stargate would fracture the
     world more than it already is.

     CARTER
     Yeah. Not just stop us fighting the Goa'uld but end things for good.
     We've seen it happen on other planets like Earth. In one case,
     public revelation of the Stargate caused an apocalyptic world war.

     COLSON
     That would be the ultimate irony, wouldn't it. You secretly save the
     world from destruction at the hands of alien invaders only for us to
     destroy ourselves out of fear, after the fact.

     CARTER
     Change your mind?

     COLSON
     Not really. I don't think it would happen.

   [Colson stands and walks to the Stargate, gesturing at it.]

     COLSON
     And if a truth of this magnitude, about the very nature of human
     existence, could lead us to destroy ourselves? Then I'd say we would
     deserve it. Wouldn't you?

   INT--STARGATE WORMHOLE

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel is watching television, where Donovan is reporting.]

     DONOVAN
     Investigators now believe that Alec Colson created the alien hoax in
     order to divert attention from his real corporate financial
     problems.

   [Carter and Colson enter.]

     DONOVAN
     Colson, who has still made no public statement...

   [Daniel turns off the television.]

     COLSON
     Corporate financial problems? What's she talking about?

     DANIEL
     The story broke about an hour ago. The President's halted trading on
     the markets. Your company's stock had fallen eighty percent, the Dow
     was down over 500 points on the whole.

     CARTER
     What's going on?

     DANIEL
     The SEC is investigating you for securities fraud.

     COLSON
     That's ridiculous!

     DANIEL
     They're saying there were irregularities in your company's last two
     financial statements.

     COLSON
     Well, it's not true! Come on! The timing of this...I'm being set up.

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

   [Vogler is sitting on a sofa, drinking. Colson and Carter enter.]

     VOGLER
     What's she doing here?

     COLSON
     She wants to help, Brian.

     VOGLER
     Oh, good. Why? Does she have a time machine so that we can go back
     and undo everything?

   [Colson sits in an armchair next to Vogler.]

     COLSON
     Brian. Brian, what's going on?

     VOGLER
     You wouldn't listen. You wouldn't stop.

   [Vogler stands, angry and upset.]

     COLSON
     So you admit you did this?

     VOGLER
     You go off on your adventures, you fly your planes, you drop by
     every now and then with a bright idea. Ever since we were kids you
     were always biting off more than you can chew, and I'm always having
     to bail you out.

     COLSON
     So you doctored the books?

   [Colson stands, angry.]

     VOGLER
     I had to. I had to do something. I told you, we were over extended.
     The stock price was the only thing keeping us afloat, and you
     wouldn't listen.

     COLSON
     No, I don't believe this.

     VOGLER
     Alec, who...who do you think told the SEC?

     COLSON
     Why? Why now? What difference could it make, Brian, once the truth
     came out...

     VOGLER
     Alec, I almost died in that plane too! I still have a family. They
     tried to kill us.

     COLSON
     Who?

     VOGLER
     Did you really think that they were gonna let you tell a secret like
     this?

     COLSON
     Brian, what are you talking about?

     VOGLER
     They call themselves the Trust.

   [Colson looks over at Carter, who looks uncomfortable. Vogler, who is
   almost in tears, sits.]

     VOGLER
     Look, all I know is they're very powerful. And, they think that
     Washington abdicated its duty to protect the planet, maybe even
     caused the problem in the first place. They see it as their
     responsibility to step in.

   [Colson sits in front of Vogler.]

     COLSON
     We can fix this.

     VOGLER

     (quietly)
     It's too late, it's done. It can't be undone.

     COLSON
     Brian, we'll both go to jail.

     VOGLER
     Yeah, but my family will be safe.

     COLSON
     What about the rest of the people that work for this company? What
     about their families?

     VOGLER
     Why weren't you thinking about them three days ago?

     CARTER
     How did they know? How did the people who threatened you know that
     you'd cooked the books? How did they know that there would be enough
     to indict both you and Alec?

   [Vogler doesn't respond. Colson looks at Carter and Vogler, pondering.]

     COLSON
     They got to you six months ago.

   [Vogler is in tears.]

     VOGLER

     Alec, they knew what you had. Don't ask me how. They had to make
     sure they could stop you. You were wrong, Alec.
     (quietly)
     You were not...this shouldn't come out. The world's not ready.

   [Colson walks over to Carter.]

     COLSON
     There must be something we can do.

     CARTER
     You signed false financial statements.

     COLSON
     I mean about the people who tried to kill us!

     CARTER
     All I know is that they operate above the law and that they've
     threatened people's lives before.

     COLSON
     Then we have to bring them down.

     CARTER
     We've tried, believe me.

     COLSON
     Well, we have to try again.

   [Colson looks over at Vogler, who sighs, hopeless.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and SG-1 exit an elevator.]

     CARTER
     So, Colson's convinced Vogler to arrange a meeting with his contact
     and wear a wire. Hopefully, we'll get enough to connect him to the
     rogue NID and then flip him for someone bigger. We're co-ordinating
     with Agent Barrett.

     DANIEL
     At the very least it may restore Colson's public image.

   INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

   [They enter the office.]

     CARTER
     Well yeah, especially if it turns out that someone in direct
     corporate competition with Colson Industries was pulling the
     strings.

   [O'Neill sits behind his desk, Daniel and Carter sit in chairs in front
   of him and Teal'c leans against a desk.]

     CARTER
     Unfortunately, without further evidence, Brian Vogler's word alone
     isn't going to be enough to undo all the damage already done to the
     company.

     TEAL'C
     What of Brian Vogler's safety?

     CARTER
     He's under close surveillance. His family's been taken into
     protective custody.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I guess the secret is safe...again.

     DANIEL
     For now.

   [The phone rings.]

     O'NEILL

     (into phone)
     O'Neill.

     CARTER

     (to Daniel)
     You know, I wouldn't count Colson out just yet. He still feels
     really strongly that the world should know the truth.

   [Daniel nods.]

     O'NEILL

     (into phone)
     Alright, thank you.

   [O'Neill puts down the phone.]

     O'NEILL
     Surveillance just found Brian Vogler, dead, in his bathroom.

     CARTER
     What? How?

     O'NEILL
     He hanged himself.

   [Carter, Teal'c and Daniel look shocked and upset.]

   INT--COLSON'S OFFICE

   [Carter enters and walks up to Colson who is sitting on a sofa, holding
   a handgun. Carter sighs.]

     CARTER
     Alec?

   [Carter pauses as she sees the gun, then goes to sit next to Colson.]

     CARTER
     I'm so sorry about Brian.

     COLSON
     I killed him. I might as well have put the gun against his head and
     pulled the trigger myself.

     CARTER
     You couldn't have known.

     COLSON
     You saw how scared he was. I know what his family meant to him. He
     was never going to do anything to put them in any danger.

   [Carter glances at the weapon.]

     CARTER
     Alec.

     COLSON
     He was my best friend.

     CARTER
     He betrayed you.

     COLSON
     No. I betrayed him.

   [Colson raises the gun in emphasis.]

     CARTER
     Why don't you put the gun down.

   [Colson looks at the weapon and sighs.]

     COLSON
     My life's over, Sam. Everything I worked for, everything I believed
     in, held to be true...

     CARTER
     Still exists. Apparently, Congress is looking into providing relief.
     The companies, the employees will survive.

     COLSON
     While I go to jail for something I didn't do?

     CARTER
     Back on the Alpha site you said, no matter what, you would rather
     make whatever time you had left meaningful. I'm here to give you
     that chance.

     COLSON
     How? By making all the indictments against me just disappear?

     CARTER
     I was thinking more along the lines of making you disappear.

     COLSON
     The problem with a guy like me, no place on Earth I can hide.

     CARTER
     Who's talking about Earth?

     COLSON
     Oh, no. No, I couldn't let you do that.

     CARTER
     Believe me, I wouldn't be here without the approval of my superiors.
     The President wasn't responsible for what happened to you but he's
     also not sorry that you were publicly discredited. Please, Alec,
     come with me. You can still make a difference. He who fights and
     runs away...

   [Colson puts down the gun.]

     COLSON
     Lives to fight another day. And no-one will ever know.

     CARTER
     Welcome to my world.

   FADE OUT
