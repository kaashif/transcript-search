   FADE IN

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Colonel Makepeace exits the Stargate and rushes out of the Gate room.]

     SERGEANT

     (over intercom)
     Welcome back Colonel Makepeace. Your briefing is scheduled at 14.30
     hours...

     MAKEPEACE
     Make a hole!

   [He dodges past SG personnel as he enters the Control Room.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Sergeant! I need to find General Hammond!

     SERGEANT
     He's in his office...Colonel!

   [Makepeace heads up the stairs.]

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [General Hammond is speaking with Major Davis.]

     HAMMOND
     What we need is support for three new teams. It's a big galaxy out
     there, Major.

   [He is cut off as Makepeace rushes in.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Sir!

     HAMMOND
     Colonel Makepeace, I'm sure you remember Major Davis.

     MAKEPEACE
     Yes, sir, I apologize. When scouting 254, sir, we came across
     several members of the Tok'ra. They told us the location of SG-1.

     HAMMOND
     Where are they, Colonel?

     MAKEPEACE
     They've been taken prisoner, sir...by Hathor.

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Makepeace spreads a blueprint across Hammond's desk.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, why do I get the feeling I'm looking at blueprints of my
     own base?

     MAKEPEACE
     Well in a way you are, sir. The entire section of the facility is a
     mockup of the SGC.

     HAMMOND
     It's damned peculiar.

     MAKEPEACE
     Well unlike Cheyenne Mountain, the Tok'ra say the exterior of the
     base is unguarded. We shouldn't face any resistance until we're
     already inside the facility, and even then it'll be light.

     DAVIS
     Can we trust them? The...Tok'ra?

     MAKEPEACE
     Their operative on the inside took a big risk just to get us this
     information, sir. I think so.

     DAVIS
     If they have someone on the inside, why can't they do something?

     HAMMOND

     They did do something, Major.
     (to Makepeace)
     You have the coordinates?

     MAKEPEACE
     Yes, sir. My team is ready to go.

     HAMMOND
     And you will, but not alone. Sergeant, I'd like you to get me the
     President on the phone.

     SERGEANT
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I want every available SG team ready to deploy in the Gate room
     within 2 hours.

     MAKEPEACE
     Yes, sir.

     DAVIS
     Sir, do you intend to commit the resources of this entire command?

     HAMMOND
     I only wish we could. Nearly half of our teams are off world right
     now on other missions.

     DAVIS
     General, that's not my point. SG-1 is a valuable asset, but they're
     still just one team.

     HAMMOND
     Major, you've got a lot to learn about how we do things around here.

     SERGEANT
     I have the President for you, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (to Makepeace)
     Let's get the job done.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate opens.]

     TECHNICIAN
     ...telemetry, tactical is go. Environmental is go.

   [The Gate room is full of SG soldiers, armed and ready to go. Hammond,
   standing on the Stargate's ramp, turns to address the gathered
   units.</blockquote>

     HAMMOND
     You've all been briefed on the mission by Colonel Makepeace. You
     know the enemy, you know the risks. What I'm trying to say is, I
     would rather not order you to do this. So, I would like all of those
     willing to attempt a rescue of SG-1 to take one step...

   [He is cut off as every soldier present takes one step forward.]

     HAMMOND
     Very well. SG units three, five, six and eleven...bring them home.

   [Colonel Makepeace walks up the ramp and Hammond salutes him.]

     HAMMOND
     Good luck Colonel.

     MAKEPEACE
     Yes, sir.

   [He turns to the soldiers and signals for them to head through the
   Stargate.]

     MAKEPEACE

     (cont'd)
     All right, let's go, move out!

   [The teams head through the Stargate. Hammond is left watching as the
   Stargate shuts down.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, FALSE GATE ROOM

   [The sound of the squealing Goa'uld can be heard. Hathor is still
   holding the writhing creature.]

     HATHOR
     We ask you once more. Which one of you shall be host to our new
     friend?

     O'NEILL

     (to Carter)
     It has her eyes.

     HATHOR
     Silence!

   [She comes before Daniel, stroking his face.]

     HATHOR

     (cont'd)
     Shall it be...our Beloved? We could spend an eternity together. Do
     you not remember the joys that we once shared in one another's arms?

     DANIEL
     I really try not to.

   [Hathor moves to stand before Carter.]

     HATHOR

     Shall it be the female then? She who would challenge us?
     (She pauses)
     You have since been possessed by a Goa'uld, we sense. Perhaps once
     more?

     CARTER
     I'm not afraid.

     HATHOR
     You should be, my dear, for the pain a symbiote can inflict in its
     host is unimaginable.

   [The Goa'uld in her hand lunges at O'Neill, hissing.]

     HATHOR
     It seems that our friend has chosen.

     O'NEILL

     (to the Goa'uld)
     What, the grey doesn't bother you? All right, fine, let's do it.
     Just, please, I beg of you, not in the back of the neck, I've got
     some problems...

   [He makes a grab for the Goa'uld, but Raleigh shoots him with her Zat.]

     HATHOR

     (to Raleigh)
     Fool!

     RALEIGH
     He would have hurt the symbiote.

     HATHOR
     Which you have done in his place! Return it to the safety of the
     Jaffa.

   [She looks down at O'Neill, who is still stunned.]

     HATHOR
     Take him somewhere where he can be properly restrained.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Makepeace orders his own team to remain with the Stargate.]

     MAKEPEACE
     All right, hold the fort.

     MARINE
     Yes, sir.

   [The SG units begin to cross the open ground, heading for the tree
   line.]

     MAKEPEACE
     What have you got?

     LIEUTENANT
     Picking up EM approximately one click away, sir. Probably power
     generation. No sign of SG-1's IFF or radio chatter.

     MAKEPEACE
     Roger that, Lieutenant.

   EXT--CHULAK (NIGHT)

   [Teal'c enters Bra'tac's darkened house to find it ravaged. He is
   attacked by an injured Bra'tac before the older Jaffa recognizes him.]

     TEAL'C
     Bra'tac.

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c. You grant a dying old man's wish.

     TEAL'C
     Do not speak of such things.

     BRA'TAC

     (trying not to move)
     Aaagh!

   [Teal'c gives Bra'tac some water.]

     TEAL'C
     Who has done this?

     BRA'TAC
     The last of Apophis' personal guard. They left me for dead.

     TEAL'C
     For what reason?

     BRA'TAC
     When I heard the news of Apophis, my heart soared Teal'c. I hoped
     there would be celebration among our people. Instead, they fear that
     with the death of Apophis, Klorel will return to claim his
     inheritance.

     TEAL'C
     They are cowards.

     BRA'TAC
     In too great a number for an old man of 135. What of your human
     friends?

     TEAL'C
     Prisoners of a Goa'uld. I have come to raise an army with which to
     free them.

     BRA'TAC
     That will not be so easy, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps. But I must try. Until then, you are in need of food and
     rest. And I am in need of armor.

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CRYOGENICS ROOM

   [O'Neill is strapped down in one of the cryogenic tanks.]

     HATHOR
     We are not pleased.

     O'NEILL
     Neither are we.

   [Hathor viciously yanks out O'Neill's memory device.]

     HATHOR
     Once host to a Goa'uld, you will take the lives of your friends.

   [She spares a glance at Daniel and Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     We don't think so.

     HATHOR
     You will have no say in the matter. You will witness their deaths
     through your own eyes...helplessly.

   [She reaches down and tears open his shirt.]

     HATHOR
     It may take some time for the Goa'uld to take control. But we will
     greatly enjoy experiencing your eventual defeat.

   [She takes the Goa'uld out of the Jaffa and places it on O'Neill's
   chest.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh god, no.

     HATHOR
     And when you awaken from the joining, you will kneel and pledge your
     loyalty to us.

   [The Goa'uld enters the back of O'Neill's neck, while Daniel and Carter
   can only look on helplessly.]

     O'NEILL
     God!

   [The discharge of a staff weapon, followed by gunfire, is heard
   throughout the pyramid.]

     HATHOR

     (to Trofsky)
     Jaffa! Kree mel!

   [Daniel and Carter are led away. O'Neill is left behind, horrified at
   what is happening to him.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [The SG units shoot an enemy Jaffa, before advancing.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Over there, over there! Secure the forward area.

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CRYOGENICS ROOM

     HATHOR

     (to Raleigh)
     Jaffa. Lok shak tal makka kree!

   [After Hathor has left with her Jaffa guards, Raleigh hurries over to
   the control panel and makes some adjustments, before returning to
   O'Neill, still trapped in the cryogenic tank.]

     RALEIGH
     O'Neill, you must fight it!

   [She turns his face to hers.]

     RALEIGH

     (cont'd)
     I am Tok'ra. The cryogenic process will prevent the melding, the
     Goa'uld within will die, but until then you must fight.

   [She closes the lid on the cryogenic tank.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [The SG units open fire on a group of enemy Jaffa. A SG soldier is a
   hit. Makepeace sees Trofsky arrive with reinforcements, and opens fire
   on the Goa'uld.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Three o'clock, three o'clock!

     TROFSKY
     Jaffa! Chel'ets!

   [The SG units kill the Jaffa and Trofsky retreats. Makepeace's rescue
   team enters the fake Gate room.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Yeah, there's no place like home. All right, area secure. Let's move
     out!

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [A lone Jaffa is escorting Daniel and Carter. Makepeace and the rescue
   team move out from their alcoves and aim their weapons at the Jaffa.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Surrender your prisoners and drop your weapon. Now!

   [Carter hits the Jaffa in the stomach, while Daniel knocks their
   captor's weapon away. They dive out of the way as the SG units open
   fire, killing the Jaffa guard. Carter quickly gets to her feet and
   approaches the rescue team.]

     CARTER
     Colonel Makepeace.

     MAKEPEACE
     Where's Colonel O'Neill?

     CARTER
     He's been taken as a host.

   [Makepeace looks at her in shock.]

     MAKEPEACE
     What?

   [Daniel appears to be still shocked by what has happened.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [Trofsky leads a group of Jaffa.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CRYOGENICS ROOM

   [The tank containing O'Neill is lowered into the icy pit, as Raleigh
   looks on. Hathor suddenly appears and confronts Raleigh.]

     HATHOR
     Jaffa kree!

     RALEIGH

     (defiantly)
     Kel'noc shree Jaffa! I am of the Tok'ra. If the Tau'ri do not
     destroy you, know this...we will!

   [Hathor uses a ribbon device on Raleigh, throwing her against the
   wall.]

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Makepeace's team are patrolling the Stargate clearing.]

     MARINE

     (into his radio)
     All secure here, sir. Whenever you're ready.

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [Carter is pulling on a BDU jacket as she follows Makepeace and his
   men.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Stand by. We're pulling out. ETA is 5 minutes.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [The marine guarding the Stargate watches as the ground starts to glow
   and a set of transport rings appear.]

     MARINE
     Sir, there's something happening back here!

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

     MAKEPEACE
     Razor, come in Razor. SG-3 we have lost radio contact, please
     respond.

     CARTER
     What's the situation?

     MAKEPEACE
     My team was covering the Stargate. Lieutenant, pass the word, we're
     moving out.

     DANIEL
     Wait, wait! What about Jack?

     MAKEPEACE
     He's a casualty.

     CARTER
     Sir, if we can get him back to Earth...

     MAKEPEACE
     Captain, if my team has lost control of the Stargate, we're not
     going anywhere. Now let's go people. We're pulling out, let's go!

   [Daniel and Carter exchange glances before moving after Makepeace and
   his men.]

   EXT--CHULAK (NIGHT)

   [A priestess, with two Jaffa guards, looks on as Teal'c approaches.]

     PRIESTESS
     I know you. Shol'va, you dare return to Chulak?

     TEAL'C
     The people of this world are my brothers and sisters. I have
     betrayed no one.

     PRIESTESS
     Except your god.

     TEAL'C
     False god. Dead, false god.

     PRIESTESS
     So you say. But his son lives.

     TEAL'C
     With you or without, he will be defeated, as was his father. Our
     people will taste freedom.

     PRIESTESS
     Bra'tac paid a heavy price for those words.

   [The priestess' guards move threateningly towards Teal'c. Angry, Teal'c
   quickly defeats them, then turns to the priestess.]

     TEAL'C
     You may tell your kinsmen that Teal'c has returned to Chulak! You
     will go to every home, of every warrior in this city. You will tell
     them that I will speak at the house of Bra'tac at dawn. Summon them!

   [The priestess runs off. Teal'c watches as she leaves.]

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (NIGHT)

   [Makepeace and his team, with Carter and Daniel, take cover at the edge
   of the clearing. Makepeace scans the Stargate clearing through his
   binoculars.]

     MAKEPEACE
     No sign of my men.

     CARTER
     Or the enemy.

   [Makepeace signals for the rescue team to move out. They cautiously
   cross the open ground, heading towards the Stargate. An SG soldier is
   suddenly thrown back as he hits an invisible barrier. The barrier,
   which briefly flares blue, prevents any of the units from approaching
   the Stargate.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Cover your flank!

   [On the Stargate platform, transport rings shoot up out of the ground,
   revealing Trofsky and a handful of Jaffa.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Open fire!

   [Carter and Daniel duck and cover their ears as the SG units open fire,
   but fail to penetrate the barrier. Trofsky, at the head of his Jaffa,
   watches and smiles.]

     MAKEPEACE
     What the hell is it?

     CARTER
     It's an energy barrier. We won't penetrate it.

     TROFSKY
     Jaffa, ha'tak.

     MAKEPEACE
     Fall back! Fall back!

   [A giant turret shoots up out of the ground, manned by a single Jaffa,
   cutting off the rescue team's escape. It is quickly followed by a
   second turret, which targets Makepeace.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Into the tree line!

   [The turrets open fire on the retreating SG units. An energy blast from
   one of the turrets kills an SG soldier and knocks Daniel off his feet.
   Carter goes back for her fallen teammate, who is looking at the dead
   soldier in stunned shock.]

     CARTER
     Daniel! Daniel, let's go!

   [Trofsky watches in satisfaction as the Jaffa manning the turrets
   target the fleeing SG personnel. Another SG soldier goes down as they
   run for cover. Makepeace, under fire, discovers a tunnel.]

     MAKEPEACE
     This way! This way! To me!

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [The SG rescue team, along with Daniel and Carter take shelter in the
   tunnel.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Secure that flank, secure that flank!

   [An SG soldier falls into the tunnel.]

     MAKEPEACE

     (cont'd)
     Is anybody behind you?

     SOLDIER
     No!

     CARTER
     These are Tok'ra tunnels.

     MAKEPEACE
     They have an operative on the inside.

     CARTER
     Who is it?

     MAKEPEACE
     Don't know, don't expect to find out anytime soon either.

   [He glances at Daniel, who has been injured.]

     MAKEPEACE

     (cont'd)
     How's the leg...can you walk?

     DANIEL
     It's just a deep, bleeding gash, but it'll be fine.

     MAKEPEACE

     (into his radio)
     Sierra Gulf Six, Sierra Gulf Six, this is Three Niner, come in...

     CARTER
     They could have made the tree line.

     MAKEPEACE
     Yeah, maybe.

     CARTER
     If we can't penetrate this barrier of theirs, maybe we can go under
     it.

     MAKEPEACE
     It's worth a try.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (NIGHT)

   [Trofsky is reporting to Hathor through a communication device.
   Hathor's image is held in the device.]

     TROFSKY
     They have fled into tunnels of Tok'ra construction. There must be a
     spy amongst us.

     HATHOR
     The Tok'ra spy has been taken care of. Take as many of the humans as
     you can alive. They will make an excellent addition to our new army
     of Jaffa.

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [The SG rescue team discovers the tunnel ahead is blocked by the energy
   barrier.]

     DANIEL
     Well I guess we can't go under it either.

     CARTER
     This isn't like any Goa'uld shield we've ever come across. It's more
     like a solid wall. The power output for something like this must be
     enormous.

     MAKEPEACE
     That's fascinating Captain, but now what'll we do?

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND
     How long are they overdue?

     SERGEANT
     Five hours, sir.

     HAMMOND
     The plan called for SG-3 to check in by now, if they lost contact.
     We'll open the Gate and send a message through. The MALP's relay
     antenna might be able to get a signal to our teams.

     SERGEANT
     Stand by to engage.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Trofsky and Jaffa are standing guard. The Stargate's chevrons begin to
   activate, signaling an incoming wormhole.]

     TROFSKY

     (to his Jaffa)
     Kree! Chappa'ai!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     SERGEANT
     Wormhole established, sir.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Trofsky and his Jaffa stand ready before the open Stargate.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

     HAMMOND

     (over the radio)
     SG-3, this is General Hammond.

   [Makepeace signals the others to stop.]

     MAKEPEACE
     Hold up, hold up.

     HAMMOND

     (over the radio)
     This is Hammond. Over.

     CARTER
     The energy barrier must be amplifying the signal.

     MAKEPEACE
     General, this is Three Niner. We hear you, sir.

     HAMMOND
     What's your status?

     MAKEPEACE
     We have two surviving Sierra Gulf Team One members, sir, but we have
     been cut off from the Stargate. We found cover in tunnels we presume
     were made by the Tok'ra, but we cannot reach the Stargate without
     reinforcements.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND

     (to the sergeant)
     See if you can direct the MALP's camera to get a picture of the
     Stargate itself.

   [He opens communications with Makepeace once more.]

     HAMMOND
     That'll take some time, Colonel. We'll try to send reinforcements
     through the Stargate in exactly six hours from now. Coordinate your
     offensive accordingly.

     MAKEPEACE
     Roger that, sir.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Trofsky sees the MALP's camera movement and shoots it with a zat gun.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [They lose contact with the rescue team on Hathor's planet.]

     HAMMOND

     Colonel Makepeace, come in. Colonel Makepeace.
     (after no reply)
     Damn!

   [The Stargate disengages.]

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

     HAMMOND
     One armored platoon should be able to take the Stargate.

     DAVIS
     General, sir, I'm sorry, it's not up to me. Even if it was, I don't
     agree with it.

     HAMMOND
     I don't really give a damn if you agree with me Major.

     DAVIS
     With all due respect, sir, you took a shot based on intelligence you
     believed to be trustworthy, but obviously...

     HAMMOND
     I promised reinforcements.

     DAVIS
     The President and Joint Chiefs are simply unwilling to risk further
     loss of life, sir. Those are their orders. I'm sorry. I'm afraid, if
     your people are going to make it back, they're going to have to do
     it on their own.

     HAMMOND
     I see. Thank you, Major.

     DAVIS
     Thank you, sir.

   [Hammond watches as Davis leaves his office.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [Makepeace and the others are resting.]

     CARTER

     (to Makepeace)
     Sir, I've been thinking. The energy barrier extends for miles around
     the facility. So it must be powered from the inside, some sort of
     field generator. Now the Tok'ra used these tunnels to access the
     facility...

     MAKEPEACE
     They must lead to it somehow.

     CARTER
     Right. Request permission to go back and try to shut it down.

     DANIEL
     I'll go with you.

     CARTER
     No Daniel, you're hurt.

     MAKEPEACE
     I'll send an SG team along to back you up.

     CARTER
     Even if I can knock out the generator, you're going to need everyone
     you've got to take on those towers.

     MAKEPEACE
     All right. If you can, blow the generator just before our
     reinforcements come through. We'll try to take on the towers at the
     same time. That might give us the tactical advantage we need.

   [Explosions are heard in the distance.]

     MAKEPEACE

     (cont'd)
     We'll try to hold the door open.

     CARTER
     Good luck.

     MAKEPEACE
     We'll try to hold the door open.

   [They hear the approach of enemy Jaffa.]

     MAKEPEACE
     All right, people, let's go. Move out!

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [Carter hides in an alcove as a pair of enemy Jaffa pass close by. When
   they have gone, she slips out and heads down the tunnel towards
   Hathor's facility.]

   INT--CHULAK, BRA'TAC'S HOUSE (DAY)

   [The room is full of cloaked and hooded people, waiting for Teal'c to
   give his speech.]

     BRA'TAC
     Teal'c has returned from the Tau'ri. If you care for this world, and
     for our people, you will listen to what he has to say.

   [Teal'c appears on the balcony above the gathered people.]

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld are not gods.

     PRIESTESS
     Shol'va!

     TEAL'C
     It is a lie we live each day. Only when he takes a host does a
     Goa'uld become strong. Even then, only as strong as the Jaffa who
     serve him. Without us, the Goa'uld are nothing.

     PRIESTESS
     Lies!

     TEAL'C
     We are their strength, we are their power...until we choose to serve
     them no more. I was witness to the final breath of Apophis. I
     watched him tremble with fear for what lay beyond. I believed that
     day would be honored for all time on Chulak. But instead, I see
     Jaffa taking up arms against one another. I see cowardice and I am
     ashamed. This is our time. It will not come again. But first we must
     grow stronger, as the people of the Tau'ri have done. I call for
     warriors to join me through the Chappa'ai, to gather weapons, to
     forge alliances with other Jaffa who seek freedom. To show the
     Goa'uld we will do battle with them wherever they may be. Who will
     join me?

   [At his words, most of the people who had gathered leave Bra'tac's
   house. Bra'tac rests his hand on Teal'c's shoulder as they watch the
   people go. As Teal'c moves to greet those who have remained, one of
   them removes his hood.]

     TEAL'C
     General.

     HAMMOND
     Not what I'd call an army, but it's a start.

     BRA'TAC
     Hammond of Texas.

     HAMMOND
     Master Bra'tac. Gentlemen, I need your help.

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CRYOGENICS ROOM

   [Carter discovers the injured Raleigh.]

     RALEIGH
     Forgive me, there was no other way.

     CARTER
     You're the Tok'ra.

   [Raleigh points to the control panel.]

     RALEIGH
     Those controls are set. Activate them.

   [When Carter does so, the cryogenic tank containing O'Neill is lifted
   out of the pit.]

     RALEIGH
     The Goa'uld within is gone. The cryogenic process destroyed it,
     before it had a chance to meld with the host. He will revive
     automatically.

   [Carter opens the cryogenic tank, revealing O'Neill. She begins to
   release the straps holding him.]

     CARTER
     Colonel? I don't feel its presence. You're going to be all right.

   [As she turns round, Hathor is waiting, armed with a glowing ribbon
   device.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [The surviving members of the rescue team, along with Daniel, are
   coming under heavy fire from enemy Jaffa. An SG soldier is hit. Daniel
   goes back for him, but Makepeace drags him away.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CRYOGENICS ROOM

   [Hathor is using her ribbon device on Carter, who is forced to her
   knees.]

     HATHOR
     We had hopes for you.

   [She is suddenly grabbed from behind by O'Neill.]

     HATHOR
     We will destroy you for this!

     O'NEILL
     We would just like you to go away!

   [He throws her into the cryogenic pit and, with a scream, she
   disappears.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter!

   [He pulls her upright and hugs her.]

     CARTER

     (recovering)
     What happened?

     O'NEILL
     Hathor's...gone.

     CARTER
     What about you?

     O'NEILL
     Cold, a little chilly, but...I'm me. I'm me.

     CARTER
     Colonel Makepeace came through with half a dozen SG teams to rescue
     us. But Trofsky's got us cut off from the Stargate. He's using an
     energy barrier. It originates from somewhere in this facility. The
     plan is to blow it before General Hammond sends reinforcements.

     O'NEILL
     And how do we plan to do that?

   [Behind them, Raleigh raises her head.]

     RALEIGH
     What you seek is hidden within the mockup of your Stargate facility.

     CARTER
     What about you?

     RALEIGH
     My symbiote may yet heal me. You must hurry. Go.

   EXT--CHULAK, WOODS (DAY)

   [Teal'c, Bra'tac and Hammond are walking through the woods.]

     HAMMOND
     What exactly are we looking for? We don't have much time.

     TEAL'C
     As you said, the Gate is carefully guarded.

     BRA'TAC
     The Stargate is most defensible. To be assured of victory, we will
     require an advantage, one hidden away, forgotten when I was still
     First Prime of Apophis.

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     BRA'TAC
     Few pilots could master it.

     HAMMOND
     And how long ago was it?

     BRA'TAC
     Some...hundred years. The forest has changed much in that time.

     TEAL'C
     There is an old Jaffa saying, General Hammond--they do not build
     them as they once did.

   [Bra'tac uncovers what appears to be an ancient Death Glider.]

     BRA'TAC
     Here!

     HAMMOND
     You intend to fly this thing?

     BRA'TAC
     Not I. Threading the needle is a skill for the young.

   INT--HATHOR'S PYRAMID, CORRIDOR

   [Carter and O'Neill are hurrying through Hathor's facility, looking for
   the generator.]

     CARTER
     The energy barrier extends around the facility for miles. The
     generators must be massive.

   [They enter Hathor's fake Gate room.]

     CARTER
     We're getting close. I'm getting energy readings off the scale. She
     was right, sir, the generator's somewhere in here.

   [O'Neill points to a lever.]

     O'NEILL
     What do you think?

     CARTER
     Try it.

   [O'Neill pulls the lever and a section of wall behind the fake Stargate
   slides back, revealing a huge turbine generator.]

     O'NEILL
     Found 'em!

   [Carter hands O'Neill some C4 and a detonator.]

     CARTER
     Set to detonate by remote?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [They walk up the ramp towards the generators.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, TUNNELS

   [Daniel, Makepeace and the surviving SG soldiers are captured by
   Hathor's Jaffa.]

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [O'Neill and Carter take cover against an embankment. The surviving SG
   units are kneeling in front of the Stargate, guarded by Trofsky and a
   handful of Jaffa. The two turrets are in position, standing guard out
   over the Stargate clearing. Carter surveys the scene through
   binoculars.]

     O'NEILL
     This part of your plan, Captain?

     CARTER
     No, sir.

     TROFSKY
     I know that you are still out there, Captain Carter! I grow tired of
     this. Surrender now, or your friends will be killed one by one.

   [Standing behind Daniel, Trofsky aims his zat at the back of his head.]

     DANIEL
     Don't listen to him, Sam!

     TROFSKY
     Silence! I will give you one minute.

     CARTER
     The reinforcements should come through in a couple of minutes. We
     could detonate the C4.

     O'NEILL
     No. Trofsky's going to start shooting any minute, we gotta buy some
     time.

   [A thought occurs to him.]

     O'NEILL
     He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?

     CARTER
     Right.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that Gate.

     CARTER
     What if they don't?

     O'NEILL
     What if they don't?

     CARTER

     (quickly)
     They will, they will.

   [O'Neill scrambles over the embankment and heads across the clearing,
   towards the waiting Jaffa. Trofsky watches.]

     O'NEILL
     Jaffa, kree!

     TROFSKY
     Kel mak, Goa'uld! Kree tak!

   [O'Neill obviously doesn't understand what Trofsky has just said.]

     O'NEILL
     You heard me, I said Kree!

     DANIEL
     Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Hey guys. Makepeace, nice rescue. Good job.

     TROFSKY
     Silence!

     O'NEILL
     All right, listen up. There's something you should know before you
     start shooting and killing and ruining what could be the start of a
     beautiful friendship--our beloved Hathor...is dead.

     TROFSKY
     What you say is impossible. Hathor is a queen. More than that, she
     is a goddess.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah ok, ex-goddess, maybe. I killed her myself. You should trust me
     on this, she's gone. She is no more. She's...well, let's face it,
     she's a former queen. So why don't we just put an end to this right
     now?

     TROFSKY
     We will end this with your surrender!

   [The chevrons on the Stargate begin to activate.]

     TROFSKY
     Jaffa kree, Chappa'ai!

   INT--CHULAK, DEATH GLIDER (DAY)

   [Teal'c, along with General Hammond, is sitting in the ancient Death
   Glider.]

     TEAL'C
     Firing the weapon will be your responsibility, General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     Understood.

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

     O'NEILL
     Now.

   [Carter blows the C4, destroying the generator.]

   INT--CHULAK, DEATH GLIDER (DAY)

     HAMMOND
     What exactly did he mean by threading the needle?

     TEAL'C
     Observe.

   [He hits the control panel and the glider races through the wormhole.
   It shoots out the other end and fires at the first turret, destroying
   it. O'Neill pulls out his sidearm, aiming at Trofsky.]

     O'NEILL
     Get down!

   [The captured SG soldiers duck, as O'Neill fires at Trofsky. Carter
   sees the second turret target O'Neill and runs across the clearing,
   shooting at the Jaffa manning the gun.]

     CARTER
     Colonel!

   [O'Neill turns at her voice, then dives out of the way just in time.
   Bra'tac, along with half a dozen of his Jaffa, emerges from the
   Stargate. As Trofsky climbs to his feet and raises his weapon, Bra'tac
   shoots him, this time killing him.]

   INT--HATHOR'S PLANET, DEATH GLIDER

     TEAL'C
     Fire.

   [Hammond fires the Death Glider's weapons, destroying the final
   turret.]

     HAMMOND
     Yeeeehaaaw!

   EXT--HATHOR'S PLANET, STARGATE CLEARING (DAY)

   [Bra'tac and his people capture Trofsky's Jaffa.]

     BRA'TAC
     Jaffa! Tal bet! Tal bet!

   [Trofsky's remaining Jaffa surrender and Bra'tac heads over to
   O'Neill.]

     BRA'TAC
     Human.

   [Teal'c and General Hammond, having landed the Death Glider, approach
   the gathering. They all share a moment of triumph before heading
   towards the Stargate.]

   FADE OUT
