   INT--HOSPITAL

   [A doctor is hurrying through the corridors of the hospital and enters
   an operating theatre. A patient is lying on a table, his face obscured
   by a green sheet.]

     DOCTOR
     Let us proceed.

   [The viewpoint continues until it is shown to be Teal'c on the
   operating table, an oxygen mask being placed over his face. Teal'c
   opens his eyes and sees that the doctor is Apophis. The Goa'uld's eyes
   glow.]

     APOPHIS
     Scalpel.

   INT--COMMUNAL SLEEPING QUARTERS

   [T wakes up, breathing heavily. He gets up and splashes water on his
   face at a basin.]

     PROBIE
     You all right?

     T
     What?

     PROBIE
     Another nightmare?

     T
     Yeah.

     PROBIE
     What about?

     T
     Nothin'! Look, I'm fine. Go on back to sleep, Probie, you got a big
     day tomorrow.

     PROBIE
     Hey, you know, if I was doing what you're doing for my stepfather,
     I'd, well...

     T
     I'm fine with it.

     PROBIE
     I know you are. I'm just saying that I'd be having nightmares too.
     Listen T, you made me feel like one of the team. If there's anything
     I can do, just...

     T
     Probie, forget about it. Now, go on back to sleep, man.

     PROBIE
     You sure you're okay?

     T
     Yeah. Yeah, man, now go on, get out of here.

   [Probie leaves. T looks down at his stomach.]

   INT--TEAL'C'S QUARTERS--SGC

   [Teal'c is kel'no'reeming in his quarters at the SGC. He touches his
   stomach gingerly. His pouch has gone.]

   END TEASER

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Carter is choosing a dessert from the display. Teal'c enters.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter.

     CARTER
     Teal'c. I thought you were going to get in a few hours of
     kel'no'reem.

     TEAL'C
     I was unable to do so.

     CARTER
     Does that happen often?

     TEAL'C
     It is rare, but it does happen. Most often when recovering from an
     injury.

     CARTER
     You look okay to me. Why don't you try a glass of warm milk?

     TEAL'C
     I would prefer not to consume bovine lactose at any temperature.

     CARTER
     Cup of herbal tea then? Can't hurt.

   [She pours a mug of tea.]

     TEAL'C
     Very well.

     CARTER
     You know you might just be preoccupied with the upcoming mission. I
     mean, there's a lot at stake, this could be the rebel Jaffas' last
     chance.

   [As Teal'c lifts the mug to his lips, the scene transitions to]

   INT--FIRE STATION

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Don't deny you're worried about it. It's all over your face.

     T
     What's on my face?

     CHIEF O'NEILL

     (entering)
     You know, T, maybe Carter's right. You should think about this a
     little more.

     T
     What?

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     The whole kidney thing.

     T
     You're talking about the transplant.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Yeah, T man, we're talking about the transplant.

     T
     Hey, what do I need with two, right?

     PROBIE
     Yeah, one'll do you right. Well, isn't it true that you can lead a
     perfectly healthy life with just one kidney?

   [O'NEILL and T look at him.]

     PROBIE
     I'll go check on breakfast.

     O'NEILL
     T, this is major surgery.

     T
     I know that. Look, we've gotten second and third opinions and second
     and third opinions on those opinions and they all come back the
     same. They're not going to find a better match than I am. Either I
     do this or Bray dies. And frankly, after all Bray's done for me, I
     owe him.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     All we're saying is if there was another option...

     T
     It's already arranged and booked. I go in day after tomorrow.

   [Probie enters, banging a triangle.]

     PROBIE
     Gentlemen and lady, breakfast is served.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     That's Captain to you, Probie and it had better be good.

   [The alarms sound. All the firefighters get up and start to gear up.
   Chief O'Neill gets into a van, the others board fire trucks, which then
   pull out of the station, sirens sounding.]

   EXT--The cabin of Engine 7

     DESPATCH

     (over radio)
     Rescue to Engine seven, we have a two-car head-on collision with
     possible multiple injuries. Be advised one of the vehicles is
     leaking gas.

     CAPTAIN CARTER

     (into radio)
     Roger that, Despatch. Confirm location at Taylorway Overpass.

     DESPATCH
     Roger that.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     ETA five minutes.

     DESPATCH
     Ten-four.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Ten-four, over and out.

     T
     Okay, Probie, great way to get your feet wet.

     PROBIE
     Ready.

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Yes, you are.

   EXT--TAYLORWAY OVERPASS

   [As the fire engines pull up, a man and a boy, both clearly badly
   injured, are trapped in a car. Another man is lying in the road, with a
   woman kneeling beside him.]

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Probie, air up. Ray, stretch out a pre-connect. Terry, I want foam
     on that line.

     T

     (talking to the man lying in the road)
     Can you hear me?

     FIRE FIGHTER 1

     (to Chief O'Neill)
     Chief, we got one adult male and a kid trapped in side the
     northbound vehicle, other driver's outside and the red vehicle's
     leaking gas pretty bad.

     FIREFIGHTER 2

     (to Captain Carter)
     I got the gas leak.

     CAPTAIN CARTER

     Great.
     (Then, to the child in the car)
     Hi there, can you hear me?

   [The child nods weakly.]

     CAPTAIN CARTER

     Good boy. I need you to stay still, we're gonna get you out of here
     soon.
     (To someone off-scene)
     He's alert and responsive. What have you got?

   [Probie shakes his head, indicating that the man in the car is dead.]

     CAPTAIN CARTER

     Okay, give me a hand here.
     (To officers off-scene)
     Let's pop the door!
     (To the boy)
     Okay, stay still, we're gonna get you out. Come on, Probie.

     T

     (Still with the man in the road)
     Hurry up with that clamp!
     (To the injured man)
     It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
     (To the other firefighters)
     Easy now, on my count--three, two, one.

   [The firefighters turn the man over, to reveal Apophis. T jumps back,
   shocked. By the red car, the firefighters are cutting the door open.
   The car is suddenly on fire.]

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     Car's on fire! Let's get this fire out!

     FIREFIGHTER
     Can't change the line. There's no pressure!

   [As they try to get the driver out of the car, the flames blaze up. T
   looks over at the car and sees Bray reaching out towards him.]

     CHIEF O'NEILL

     (Into radio.)
     Everybody out of there!

   [The firefighters all pull back, except T.]

     CAPTAIN CARTER
     T, get you ass out of there, that's an order!

   [T leaps over the burning car and talks to the driver.]

     BRAY
     Save yourself!

     T
     I'm getting you out, old man.

     BRAY
     Save yourself!

     T
     No!

   [T tries to smash the windscreen with his elbow, but the car explodes
   and he is thrown across the road.]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Teal'c collapses to the floor.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c! Get a medical team down here now!

     SF
     Yes, Ma'am.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is examining Teal'c.]

     FRAISER
     Well, whatever happened, you seem fine now. Still, I've never heard
     of any Jaffa fainting before, let alone you.

     TEAL'C
     I did not faint, Dr. Fraiser.

     CARTER
     Sorry, Teal'c, but you did. One minute I was talking about the
     upcoming mission, the next minute you were lying flat on your back.
     Could this have anything to do with his inability to kel'no'reem
     earlier?

     FRAISER
     Well, kel'no'reem meditation is like sleep in the sense that it's
     necessary in order for a Jaffa to rejuvenate his body but not being
     able to reach a state of kel'no'reem on just one occasion wouldn't
     cause you to faint like that, would it?

     TEAL'C
     No, it would not.

     FRAISER
     And you're not in any pain?

     TEAL'C
     None.

     CARTER
     Maybe you were just with what I was saying?

   [Teal'c looks at Carter.]

     CARTER
     No, fine. On that note, I'll say goodnight.

     FRAISER
     Night, Sam.

     CARTER
     Prescribe him some warm milk.

     TEAL'C
     I have no intention of remaining here, Doctor Fraiser.

     FRAISER
     Teal'c, this has never happened to you before, so I do want to run a
     few tests.

     TEAL'C
     That would be completely...

     FRAISER
     Ah! Doctor's orders! And close your eyes and try to relax, okay?

   [Teal'c lies down.]

     TEAL'C
     Very well.

   INT--HOSPITAL ROOM

   [T is in bed. Chief O'Neill is sitting on a bed opposite.]

     T

     (sitting up)
     O'Neill. Bray. Bray, he was in that car!

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     What?

     T
     He was in the car.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Who was?

     T
     Bray. Did you get him out?

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     T, he's two floors up. Waiting for his new kidney. We're trying to
     arrange for him to come down for a little visit.

     T
     The guy in the car, what happened to him?

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Ah, there's no way--he was dead before we got there.

     T
     I could have sworn...

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Well, listen, um, they're thinking of postponing the surgery for a
     day or so.

     T
     I'm fine.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Sure you are. How's your head?

     T
     Pretty bad.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Why don't I go and see what Western medicine has for your, huh?

     T
     Chief, thanks for being here for me, man.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Any time.

   [Chief O'Neill leaves.]

   INT--HOSPITAL HALLWAY

   [Chief O'Neill comes across Bray in a wheelchair, pushed by Shauna.]

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Bray, you old fart, you still alive?

     BRAY
     Chief, you sorry excuse for a human being. When are you going to get
     the message and stop visiting me?

     CHIEF O'NEILL

     Like a moth to flame, I can't help myself.
     (To Shauna)
     Hi, honey.

     SHAUNA
     Hi, Jack. Is he awake?

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Yeah. He's got a little bit of a headache.

     BRAY
     I'm not surprised he's in pain. He was sent flying, the way I hear
     it.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Yeah. Why don't you go on in?

     SHAUNA

     Uh, Jack?
     (To Bray)
     You go ahead without me.

   [Bray goes into T's room.]

     SHAUNA
     Um, did T say anything about Bray?

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     About thinking he was the guy in the car?

     SHAUNA
     Yeah, I mean he's been mumbling in his sleep. Do you think he's
     okay? I mean, do you think this transplant thing is making him...

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     This is a big deal. I think it'd mess with anyone's head. Look, I
     know a resident psychologist here. I'll have a talk with him. He's
     good, you'll like him.

     SHAUNA
     Thanks, Jack.

     CHIEF O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   INT--HOSPITAL ROOM

   [T and Shauna are kissing. Bray is looking out of the window.]

     SHAUNA
     I don't know what I would do, my love.

     T

     You'll never have to know. BRAY
     You want to tell me what the hell you were thinking? Hm?

     T
     I guess I wasn't.

     BRAY
     We're firemen. There's putting your life on the line and there's
     being stupid. Guess which one you picked?

     T
     I know, I know.

     SHAUNA
     His only fault is he wants to help people.

     BRAY
     By sacrificing himself?

     SHAUNA
     Doesn't matter now. It's over. He's all right.

     BRAY
     No, he's not.

     T
     Bray, what are you talking about man? You're starting to scare me.

     BRAY
     You should be scared.

     SHAUNA
     Bray.

     BRAY
     Why aren't you burned anywhere? The car exploded right in your face
     and you come away from it with a headache? Something's wrong. And he
     knows it.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

     TEAL'C
     What's happening?

     FRAISER
     I'm sorry, Teal'c. I didn't mean to wake you.

     TEAL'C
     Wake me?

     FRAISER
     According to these readings, you've been fast asleep for most of the
     night.

     TEAL'C
     My mind was filled with images. Thoughts of me yet I was not
     entirely myself.

     FRAISER
     Happens to humans all the time.

     O'NEILL
     It's called dreaming, Teal'c.

     FRAISER
     You don't dream while in kel'no'reem meditation?

     TEAL'C
     Not in this manner. While in a state of kel'no'reem I am in complete
     control of my thoughts.

     FRAISER
     So how do you feel?

     TEAL'C
     It was so real.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, I love it when that happens.

     FRAISER
     It's not uncommon especially in the first moments after one wakes up
     to feel disoriented. Not uncommon for humans, very strange for
     Jaffa.

     O'NEILL
     So, Doc, this is Teal'c we're dealing with here, right. I mean,
     aside from the bad dreams and the odd fainting spell, he's
     still...what

     FRAISER
     He's still better off than ninety-nine percent of my patients. Tests
     show you're in otherwise perfect health.

     O'NEILL
     Good. So he can go back to work?

     FRAISER
     Yeah, so long as the dreams don't become debilitating or you faint
     again, I don't see why not.

     O'NEILL
     Excellent. Let's go.

     FRAISER
     Ah, just two more minutes, Colonel. I'd like to perform a routine
     examination of his symbiote and then you can go.

   [Fraiser draws the curtain. It is drawn back with a swish.]

   INT--HOSPITAL ROOM

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Hi.

     T
     Hi.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     I'm Doctor Daniel Jackson. I'm one of the resident psychologists
     here. I heard you might like to talk.

     T
     So, Daniel Jackson.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Ah, you can just call me Daniel if you like.

     T
     You think I'm crazy?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     No, not yet. We just met.

     T
     We haven't met before?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     No, no, I don't think so.

     T
     I'm sure we have.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Well, maybe in another life or something like that, you know if you
     believe in that sort of thing, some people do. I just came by to
     talk.

     T
     About what?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Whatever's on your mind. Possibly about this operation that's
     scheduled for what is it, tomorrow? Course it had to be postponed
     because apparently you were blown twenty feet across a street, so...

     T
     I'm going through with it.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     I never said you shouldn't go through with it, but a couple of your
     friends just thought you might want to talk about it. So, just so
     you know. Could we get out of here, maybe go for a walk or
     something?

     T
     Sure. You're the doctor.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Right, let's go.

   EXT--HOSPITAL GROUNDS

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     So, how did Bray become your stepfather?

     T
     Well, technically, I guess he isn't, I just think of him that way.
     He raised me after my father died.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Good. You got a good job, you help people out and from what your
     friends tell me, you're quite the hero.

     T
     Yeah, well that was just plain stupid.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     What was?

     T
     What brought me here in the first place. We came on a crash site and
     one of the drivers was hurt pretty bad.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     You thought he was Bray, your stepfather.

     T
     Who told you that?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Your friends care about you, that's why they've asked me to see you.
     It's a good thing. You're giving up a part of yourself, a vital part
     and you're doing it out of love.

     T
     So?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     So, so, maybe you're afraid. Maybe subconsciously you're afraid that
     you won't be yourself any more.

     T
     The doctor told me I would lead a perfectly normal life after the
     transplant.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Self-preservation is a powerful instinct.

     T
     I'm not afraid, Doc. Not one bit.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     That's quite a burden to carry, all that denial. And until you're
     willing to let it go, I can't let you go through with the operation.

     T
     No, you can't stop me.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Ah, yes, I can actually and I will.

     T
     Why?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     In medicine we don't destroy one man's life to save another. That's
     not how it works.

     T
     Look at me, Doc. I'm the healthiest damn human being you've ever
     seen and you know it. I'm a hundred percent.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     I'm not just talking about your body.

     T
     Then what?

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     You've been having nightmares, almost every night, from what I've
     been told.

     T
     Big deal.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     And? And it's a big deal and, yesterday you had a full-blown
     hallucination. I'm sorry, but that is a big deal. Look, all I'm
     saying is that your life is every bit as important as Bray's, so if
     you're going to go through with this, you have to accept what it is
     going to do to you.

     T
     I want to save Bray.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     I know you do. And I want to help you do that. That is a promise.
     Now, if you know your way back to your room, I have to go. I'm
     extremely late for another appointment. So, uh...

     T
     What is it Doc, is my hour up already?

   [Doctor Jackson walks quickly away.]

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     No, actually, your twenty minutes are up. We'll work our way up to
     an hour.

   [T walks back through the hospital grounds. As he passes through some
   bushes, he emerges in...]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c walks into the Gate room. The Stargate is active. O'Neill,
   Carter and Jonas are waiting on the ramp.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, let's go. You know how much it costs to keep that thing on?

     TEAL'C
     I'm ready.

     O'NEILL
     Good, let's move out. What's wrong with you?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing is wrong, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     I need you to focus.

     TEAL'C
     I am ready.

     O'NEILL
     All right then.

   [Teal'c enters the wormhole. When he exits at the other end, he is
   in...]

   INT--HOSPITAL HALLWAY

   [Teal'c walks into a room. Apophis is standing there in all his
   finery.]

     APOPHIS
     You are afraid to die.

     TEAL'C
     No.

     APOPHIS
     Because you know I will be waiting for you in the afterlife.

     TEAL'C
     Who are you?

     APOPHIS
     You know who I am Teal'c. I am your god.

     TEAL'C
     No!

   [A nurse comes up behind Teal'c.]

     NURSE
     Excuse me, Sir? Are you lost?

   INT--HOSPITAL WARS

   [The ward is full of male patients, looking up in surprise.]

     T
     No, I'm...

     NURSE
     Are you sure you're all right?

     T
     I'm fine. It's the wrong room. Sorry.

   [He leaves. The nurse follows him.]

     NURSE
     Sir? Sir?

   [T runs along a corridor until he reaches a door. He turns to see
   Apophis dressed as a surgeon.]

     APOPHIS
     You cannot escape your fate, Shol'va.

   [Teal's opens the door and enters...]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     O'NEILL
     Hey, come on, let's go. You know how much it costs to keep that
     thing open? Bra'tac's waiting for you.

     TEAL'C
     Something is wrong.

     CARTER
     What is it?

     TEAL'C
     He must have taken it.

     JONAS
     Who must have taken what?

   [Teal'c grabs at his clothes, trying to undo his jacket.]

     O'NEILL

     (gesturing at the Stargate)
     Shut it down! Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     My symbiote is gone.

     O'NEILL
     Fraiser just gave you a clean bill of health.

     TEAL'C
     My symbiote is gone! My symbiote is gone!

   [He collapses to the floor.]

     O'NEILL
     Get a medical team down here right now!

     TEAL'C
     Help me, help me.

   EXT--PLANET

   [On a planet, a battlefield is seen, covered with dead Jaffa. Only
   Teal'c and Bra'tac appear to be alive. They are lying together at the
   shore of a large lake.]

     TEAL'C
     Hold on, old man.

   [Teal'c takes the symbiote from Bra'tac's pouch and places it in his
   own.]

     TEAL'C
     Help me, help me.

   INT--NIGHT--T's BEDROOM

   [T and Shauna are in bed.]

     SHAUNA
     It's just a nightmare, you're safe.

     T
     I was in the hospital.

     SHAUNA
     That's right. They performed the transplant and you recovered. They
     sent you home.

     T
     I don't remember.

     SHAUNA
     You saved his life.

     T
     I don't remember coming home.

     SHAUNA
     But you are home. With me. And everything's all right.

   [T sits up and touches the large scar on his side.]

     T
     O'Neill. O'Neill picked me up and he took me home.

     SHAUNA
     That's right. Bray's gonna be fine. And so are you. It's just a
     nightmare, my love.

     T
     I feel like, Shauna, I feel like I'm going insane.

     SHAUNA
     A few bad dreams.

     T
     You can't tell anybody about this, okay? Because I don't want people
     to start thinking I'm going crazy.

     SHAUNA
     I promise.

     T
     When I'm there, this is the dream.

     SHAUNA
     When you're there?

     T
     I'm part of something. Military or underground. A secret place.

     SHAUNA
     Sweetheart, I don't understand what you're saying.

     T
     I'm serious.

     SHAUNA
     It's a dream.

     T
     They say this is the dream. And when I'm there, I believe it. When
     I'm there, it makes sense that this can't be real. When I'm here...

     SHAUNA
     Honey, look at me. Look at me. Kiss me.

   [They kiss.]

     SHAUNA
     How can that not be real?

   [She rests her head on his shoulder.]

     EXT--HOSPITAL

   INT--HOSPITAL HALLWAY

   [T walks along the corridor and enters Bray's room.]

     BRAY
     Hey. How're you feeling?

     T
     Better. And you?

     BRAY
     They haven't told you? They say my body's rejecting the new kidney.

     T
     What?

     BRAY
     They're pumping me fill of anti-rejection drugs. This and that and
     everything, but I got to say, if it doesn't take, I'm ready to go. I
     really am. How do you know this operation isn't keeping me from
     going to a better place?

     T
     Come on, Bray, don't even start talking like that!

     BRAY
     Why are we so afraid of dying? I'm not afraid.

     T
     I am, okay? I'd rather die myself than let you go. So you hang in
     there, old man. Because I did not go through this so you could give
     up on me.

   EXT--HOSPITAL GROUNDS.

   [T is sitting at a picnic table as Doctor Jackson approaches.]

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Am I late? I thought it was supposed to be at eleven?

     T
     It is.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Oh, good. Been up to see Bray?

     T
     Just came from there.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     How's he doing?

     T
     His body is rejecting the new kidney.

     DOCTOR JACKSON

     (Sitting down opposite T.)
     Well, you knew that might happen.

     T
     There's got to be something we can do.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     You've done everything humanly possible.

     T
     I didn't go through this so Bray could die.

     DOCTOR JACKSON
     Why are you going through this? I mean, why do you think this is
     happening? You know, Bray, the nightmares you've been having, all of
     it?

     T
     The nightmares are gone.

     DANIEL
     You're not dreaming you're part of some secret military operation
     underground?

     T
     Shauna told you.

     DANIEL
     No.

     T
     Then how the hell do you know?

     DANIEL
     Just, I know. It doesn't matter.

     T
     Fine. I'll ask her myself.

   [T stands up. Daniel follows. They walk through the grounds.]

     DANIEL
     Because we've talked about this before. You just don't remember,
     just like you don't remember the operation or getting discharged
     from the hospital, right? Right? Well, tell me about it again.

     T
     I'm part of something, a team.

     DANIEL
     Who's on this team?

     T
     Same as the fire hall. Chief O'Neill, Captain Carter, hell even
     Probie's there.

     DANIEL
     Probie is who?

     T
     Probationary fireman. It's the same as calling someone a rookie.

     DANIEL
     Right.

     T
     His name's Jonas.

     DANIEL
     And what does this team do? The one in your dream?

     T
     Go places, you know, try to make a difference. Help people.

     DANIEL
     You're a fireman.

     T
     No, we um...

     DANIEL
     You're just going to have to trust me.

     T
     All right. We go to other planets through a big ring of shimmering
     blue water. I'm not even human.

     DANIEL
     So you're a...

     T
     A Jaffa. I carry this thing around in my gut, that's ah, is called a
     symbiote. Helps keep me alive.

     DANIEL
     Something like a kidney, something you might be hesitant to give up?
     Let me ask you this, does Bray fit anywhere into your dream?

     T
     Which one? Hell, I don't even know what's real any more.

     DANIEL
     Well, you're not alone in that. I mean, philosophers have been
     trying to figure out the answer to that question for a long time. So
     just let me get this straight.

   [They sit on a bench.]

     DANIEL
     When you're there, this is the dream, and when you're here, that's
     the dream?

     T
     They're both so real, I...

     DANIEL
     And in both you're having nightmares?

     T
     Hell, I'm not even supposed to dream in the other one.

     DANIEL
     Because you're Jaffa?

     T
     Don't ask me. I...

     DANIEL
     Well, it's really neither here nor there. The point is, both can't
     be real.

     T
     No.

     DANIEL
     So you're trying to figure out which of the two lives you seem to be
     leading is the real one so that you can stay there or here or
     wherever it is you're supposed to be once and for all. But maybe the
     answer to that question is something you haven't even considered.
     Maybe neither one is real.

     T
     What?

     DANIEL
     Think about it. If you can't distinguish between them, if the one
     seems equally as real as the other, maybe you don't belong in either
     one.

     T
     Then what do I do?

     DANIEL
     Hang in there, just a little while longer.

   [Daniel stands and walks away.]

     T
     You can't leave me here like this!

     DANIEL
     I haven't left your side, Teal'c. And I'm not going to. That's a
     promise.

   [As O'Neill puts his hand on Teal'c shoulder, the scene shifts to...]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c is lying wounded on the ramp.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

     FRAISER
     It's okay.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, you're gonna be all right. Just hang in there.

     FRAISER
     Teal'c, listen to me okay. This is very important. How long have you
     gone without your symbiote?

     TEAL'C
     Bra'tac?

     FRAISER
     It's okay. It's okay. He's alive, thanks to you but I need to know
     how long...

     TEAL'C
     You must save Bra'tac!

     FRAISER
     We'll do our best, okay. Let's take them both directly to OR One.
     Let's move. Easy.

   [Teal'c is lifted onto a gurney and the medical team wheel him out.
   Hammond enters.]

     HAMMOND
     What happened, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     It was a set-up from the get-go, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     The meeting of the rebel leaders?

     O'NEILL
     There was no meeting. It was an ambush.

     CARTER
     We found over a hundred rebel Jaffa dead. Every single one of them
     had had their symbiotes removed, except one.

     O'NEILL
     Bra'tac.

     JONAS
     He and Teal'c were the only warriors left alive.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c left for this meeting over three days ago. How did he manage
     to survive that long without a symbiote?

     CARTER
     Sir, it's possible Teal'c survived the ambush and used his own
     symbiote to keep both he and Bra'tac alive until we got there.

     JONAS
     He knew we'd show up as soon as he was late.

     HAMMOND
     Well how long can two Jaffa survive with only one symbiote between
     them?

     CARTER
     We've no idea, Sir. Up until a couple of hours ago, we didn't even
     think it was possible.

     HAMMOND
     Report to the briefing room in one hour.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Fraiser and Hammond climb the spiral staircase to the briefing room.]

     FRAISER
     We've managed to stabilise them by using the same method Teal'c must
     have used to keep them both alive otherwise he would have been dead
     when they found him. You see, we're essentially transferring the
     symbiote from one to the other.

     HAMMOND
     How long can you keep them both alive that way?

     FRAISER
     I really don't know, Sir. It's a miracle they've survived this long.
     Don't ask me how Teal'c had the strength or the wherewithall to keep
     it up.

     JONAS
     Dr. Fraiser, forgive the obvious, but why can't we just get him
     another symbiote?

     CARTER
     We've looked into it. It's all but impossible right now to find a
     symbiote that isn't already being used.

     JONAS
     Right.

     HAMMOND
     We contacted the Tok'Ra as soon as we received your emergency radio
     transmission and apprised them of Teal'c and Bra'tac's condition.
     Jacob's on the way.

     O'NEILL
     Sir, if it comes down to a choice...

     HAMMOND
     Jack, we have to consider that Teal'c has already made a choice.
     Now, according to Dr. Fraiser, he's gone through hell in order to
     see it through.

     O'NEILL
     Well, let's hope it doesn't come down to that.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Carter walks up the ramp towards the open event horizon as Jacob
   arrives.]

     CARTER
     Dad, thank god you're here.

     JACOB
     Hopefully I'm not too late.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac are lying on adjacent beds.]

     JONAS
     How are they?

     TEAL'C
     Shauna...

     JONAS
     Shauna?

     FRAISER
     Shau'nac. She was very important in Teal'c's life. You see, when a
     Jaffa goes without a symbiote for any protracted length of time, at
     least according to Jaffa legend, his life flashes before his eyes.
     You know, it might help if you talk to him.

     JONAS
     Yeah. Teal'c, you gotta hang in there. I need you. You made me feel
     like one of the team. If there's anything I can do...

     TEAL'C
     Don't worry about it, Probie. Go back to sleep.

     JONAS
     Probie?

   [Jacob, Carter, O'Neill and Hammond enter the infirmary.]

     JACOB
     Dr. Fraiser, what's their condition?

     FRAISER
     They're critical. All three of them.

     O'NEILL
     Three?

     FRAISER
     Due to his advanced age and the fact that his body is showing signs
     of rejecting the symbiote, Bra'tac has had to have it longer than
     Teal'c. Now it seems that the strain of keeping them both alive is
     too much for the symbiote. I don't think it could restore either one
     of them at this point.

     JONAS
     Well, what about a hand device?

     JACOB
     I brought something better. Something that could work as effectively
     as a symbiote. At least for the short term.

   [Jacob holds up a vial.]

     O'NEILL
     What's that?

     CARTER
     Tretonin, Sir.

   [Jacob hands the vial to Fraiser.]

     JONAS
     The drug the Pangarans offered us?

     O'NEILL
     Whoa! That's ground Goa'uld, isn't it?

     JACOB
     It's a little more refined than that, Jack, but yes, it is derived
     from Goa'uld symbiotes.

     CARTER
     It supplanted the immune systems in the Pangarans, why couldn't it
     do the same for the Jaffa?

     FRAISER
     I've already considered it. It won't work. The sample I studied was
     designed to take the place of a human immune system.

     JACOB
     We've since refined it specifically for Jaffa physiology. The Tok'Ra
     have been looking forward to an end to the Jaffa dependence on
     symbiotes for centuries now. We've been working on this Tretonin
     variant ever since you introduced us to the Pangarans. But it hasn't
     been tested.

     FRAISER
     But even if it does work, I mean, Teal'c and Bra'tac will become
     just as dependent on the Tretonin as the Pangarans.

     JACOB
     Given time, we can solve that problem. But at least they'll be
     alive.

     FRAISER
     If I knew for a fact that this is what Teal'c wanted...

     CARTER
     Janet, this could ultimately lead to freedom from Goa'uld oppression
     for all Jaffa. That's something that Teal'c and Bra'tac want more
     than anything.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

     FRAISER
     Yes, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c without Junior. That's a concept.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Teal'c is lying in bed. He awakes to see Daniel standing by the bed.]

     DANIEL
     Hey, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Am I dreaming?

     DANIEL
     No, not this time. It's late, everyone's gone home for the night. I
     just wanted to make sure you're okay.

     TEAL'C
     What of Bra'tac?

     DANIEL
     Bra'tac's fine. Thanks to you.

     TEAL'C
     And to you as well, I believe.

     DANIEL
     No, no that was you. I don't know anyone that could have done what
     you did. You kept him alive for three days without ever thinking
     about yourself. Every time you gave up your symbiote, you know it
     might be for the last time.

     TEAL'C
     This experience has been very different for me. It seemed so real.

     DANIEL
     Your mind took you where it needed to go to get you through this. I
     promise you this is real. You're just going to have to trust me on
     that. You go to sleep. When you wake up, everything is going to be
     fine.

     TEAL'C
     Is that a promise, Daniel Jackson?

     DANIEL
     That's a promise.

   [Teal'c nods, then closes his eyes. As the rest of the infirmary comes
   into view, Daniel is no longer there.]

   Fade out.
