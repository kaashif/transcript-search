   TEASER

   EXT--DARK WOODS, NIGHT

   [Mist is rising from the ground. Two soldiers in partial SGC uniforms
   run through the woods, chased by several native men leaping through the
   trees. The men are clad in breechclouts with painted faces and bodies.
   Some are wearing headdresses made from long grass; others have clay
   helmets that cover their entire head. The men with headdresses have
   blowguns.]

     CONNOR
     Come on, Frakes, let's go!

   [As they run, a GDO falls to the forest floor.]

     FRAKES
     Connor! Connor, I've lost the remote!

   [Frakes runs back and drops to his knees, trying to find the GDO. The
   men in the trees close in. Connor joins him.]

     CONNOR

     (picks up something)
     Got it!

   [One of the natives puts his blowpipe to his lips. A dart shoots out
   and hits Frakes in the shoulder. Frakes falls. Connor runs on, not
   noticing. Connor reaches the DHD and starts pressing the glyphs for
   Earth. Frakes stumbles down the path behind him, the arrow still stuck
   in his shoulder. The natives close in. Frakes pauses, his eyes rolling
   back. He falls face-first onto the ground. Connor punches in the last
   symbol and hits the red center of the DHD. The wormhole opens. Connor
   punches in the code on the GDO. He looks behind him, obviously just
   noticing that his companion is not with him.]

     CONNOR

     Frakes!
     (runs back down the path)
     Frakes!

     FRAKES

     Go.
     (looking desperate)
     Go!

   [Connor looks around at the forest. Frakes falls back to the ground.
   Looking unhappy, Connor whirls around to run back to the Stargate.
   Behind him, Frakes pushes himself up, then crumples sideways. He looks
   up to see himself surrounded by the natives in clay helmets, the men in
   headdresses right behind them. Another man, this one wearing some kind
   of robes over an SGC uniform pushes through the crowd, a rifle in hand.
   Grabbing Frakes' hair, he pulls him into a seated position. Another
   man, covered from head to foot in a robe, comes out of the crowd to
   stand before them. Although we can't see his clothing beneath, dogtags
   catch the light.]

     HANSON

     (reprovingly)
     Frakes, Frakes, Frakes. I'm disappointed in you, my son.

   [Hanson pulls out a pistol and primes it. He aims the gun at Frakes.
   The natives mutter uneasily. Hanson fires.]

   [At the Stargate, Connor turns to look back.]

   [Hanson motions to the natives, who run toward the Stargate. As Baker
   and Hanson look down the path, the wormhole blinks out of existence.]

     HANSON
     So. Connor got through.

     BAKER
     What about this one?

     HANSON

     (looking back)
     Burn him.

   [One of the natives douses Frakes in a liquid. Baker lowers a torch and
   ignites the liquid. Flames rise as Frakes' body catches fire.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Teal'c exits wormhole, followed by O'Neill. As the wormhole closes,
   Daniel and Carter are standing by the DHD. They all look at the
   surrounding foliage.]

     DANIEL
     For a planet with a U.V. radiation as high as this one's supposed to
     have, the plant life seems to be doing very well.

     CARTER
     Apparently, Abydos was the exception, not the rule, as far as trees
     are concerned.

     DANIEL
     Well, that makes sense. I mean, in order for a planet to support
     human life, there must be some form of carbon-based vegetation,
     right?

   [Carter nods.]

     TEAL'C
     It is no accident. Many Stargate worlds were terra-formed by the
     Goa'uld centuries ago.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, let's take a quick look around the Gate before we move out and
     find SG-9.

     CARTER
     They can't be that far.

     DANIEL
     I don't know, this Stargate is literally out in the middle of
     nowhere. I doubt it plays an active role in anybody's culture.

   [O'Neill walks away, Daniel following. Carter looks uneasily up at the
   trees.]

     TEAL'C
     Is there a problem, Doctor Carter?

     CARTER
     No birds.

   [She looks around again, then moves away, following O'Neill and Daniel.
   Teal'c looks up, his gaze sober.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The sun is shining brightly. Daniel walks alone through the woods.]

     DANIEL
     There should be a road up here or something, or...Jack? Guys?

   [Under his feet, the leaf covering shifts. Connor jumps up from his
   hiding place and wraps an arm around Daniel's neck.]

     DANIEL
     Aaah!

   [Connor grabs Daniel's gun and aims it at his neck as Daniel tries to
   pull his arm away.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, okay. Don't shoot.

   [O'Neill suddenly appears behind Conner, his own gun out. He aims it at
   Connor's temple.]

     O'NEILL

     (grating)
     That's very sound advice.

   [Connor pulls the pistol away from Daniel. O'Neill grabs it with his
   free hand, the pistol on Connor never wavering.]

     CONNOR

     (not losing his grip on Daniel, but looking surprised.)
     Colonel O'Neill!

   [He looks relieved.]

     O'NEILL
     Lieutenant Connor?

   [Connor sags. O'Neill and Daniel catch him as he falls.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, all right.

   [O'Neill and Daniel each grab an arm and help Connor walk away.]

   EXT--PLANET

   [The team rests on the Stargate platform, clustered around Connor.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, Connor, what's going on? Command received your signal six
     hours ago, and no one came through. Why?

     CONNOR
     Hanson.

     CARTER
     Where is he? We need to talk to...

     CONNOR

     (interrupting)
     No! Don't.

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     CONNOR

     (eyes widening)
     Frakes. He...

   [Connor jumps up, runs down the path. SG-1 follows him. Connor stops,
   bending down beside a pile of ashes and bits of bone on the ground.]

     O'NEILL
     Connor?

   [As SG-1 comes to a halt in front of him, Connor picks out dogtags,
   which are all that's apparently left of Frakes.]

     O'NEILL
     Connor. I need to know what happened.

     CONNOR
     Permission to speak freely about a superior officer, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Go ahead.

     CONNOR
     He's lost it. He's out of control.

     CARTER
     Captain Hanson?

     CONNOR
     Maybe it was the sun. The, uh, radiation...

     DANIEL
     What are...Are you saying that the sun did this to Frakes?

     CONNOR
     No, sir. Captain Hanson did that to Frakes.

     CARTER
     What?

     CONNOR
     For trying to get back through the Gate.

     O'NEILL
     I don't buy that.

     CONNOR
     Sir. We were trying to warn Command about what's really going on.
     The people here...they believe he's their god.

     TEAL'C
     Because you came through the Stargate.

     CONNOR
     No, no. You don't get it. Hanson believes it too.

   [SG-1 is silent for a moment.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

   [Carter follows O'Neill away from Connor.]

     O'NEILL

     (pulls off his sunglasses and rubs his eyes.)
     I want you to take Connor back through the Stargate. Report to
     General Hammond what's happened here.

     CARTER

     (looking obstinate)
     No, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (incredulous)
     "No, sir?"

     CARTER
     If you're going after Captain Hanson, I should go with you. I can
     get to him.

     O'NEILL

     (testy)
     Look, Captain. Either we're bringing him back to face a court
     martial, or not. I think we both know what the 'not' means.

     CARTER
     I know him, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, that would be the problem, wouldn't it?

     CARTER
     I gave back the ring because I know him. I know how he thinks, how
     he operates.

     O'NEILL
     How he likes to play God?

     CARTER
     I don't understand how that could happen any more than you do. But
     if SG-1 is going after him, then I am going with you.

     CONNOR

     (interrupting)
     Wait a minute. No. You...you...you can't do that. There are
     hundreds, probably thousands of them. He's...he's their god. They'll
     die for him; they'll kill for him in a heartbeat.

     O'NEILL
     That's not your problem. Now, I need someone to report back to the
     General, and that is you.

   [He looks at Connor.]

     CONNOR
     No, sir.

     O'NEILL

     (looking incredulous again)
     "No, sir?"
     (turning to look at Carter)
     Does it say "colonel" anywhere on my uniform?

     CONNOR
     I know the planet and the situation. I think it's suicide. But if
     you're going, I'm going, sir.

     TEAL'C
     But you are not physically able.

     CONNOR
     Frakes was my friend.

     CARTER
     This isn't about revenge.

     CONNOR
     Maybe not for you.

   [Carter stares at Connor, who looks away and brushes past her. ]

     CONNOR
     We've got to move now. In daylight.

     O'NEILL

     (sighs)
     Well. We're off to see the wizard.

     CONNOR
     Hope you packed lots of sunblock.

     DANIEL
     Well, we're mostly under cover.

     CARTER
     The probe's data indicated that shade, even heavy cloud cover won't
     protect us. It can be pouring rain and we'll still burn.

     CONNOR
     She's right.

     O'NEILL
     Then why on Earth are we travelling during the day?

     CONNOR
     We're not on Earth. People here live in caves. I think they used to
     be mines. They only come out at night. They're probably still after
     me, sir.

   [O'Neill registers that, but pulls on his sunglasses anyway.]

     O'NEILL
     To Oz.

   [The team follows Connor, looking around them at the woods first.]

   EXT--PLANET--HANSON'S CAMP

   [Baker looks up at the sun, then enters a cave lit by several fires
   burning.]

     BAKER
     You were right. They sent SG-1.

   [Hanson, his face marked with angry red burns, lifts his dogtags away
   from his neck and stares at them, then pulls, snapping the chain. He
   throws them away.]

   EXT--SG-1 CAMP, NIGHT

   [Daniel and Carter are sitting side by side in front of a fire. Daniel
   is eating, Carter is examining something.]

     DANIEL
     This tastes like chicken.

     CARTER
     So what's wrong with that?

     DANIEL
     It's macaroni and cheese.

   [Behind the tents, Teal'c and O'Neill are standing guard in the woods.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     The perimeter is established.

   [Teal'c picks up and throws a rock. A beeping noise ensues, and a light
   high in a tree comes on. Teal'c reaches down and turns off both.]

     O'NEILL
     Perfect. If any little rocks sneak up on us, we'll have plenty of
     warning.

   [Connor approaches the fire. Carter looks up.]

     CARTER
     So, uh, any indigenous lions, tigers, or bears I should lie awake
     worrying about?

     CONNOR
     The plant life's all that seems to live very long in the sun.

     DANIEL
     You know, how could something like this actually happen? I
     mean...the SG teams are supposedly made up of well-trained
     professionals.

     CONNOR
     Well, when we first met the cave dwellers, they immediately bowed
     down to us. Thought we were gods.

     DANIEL
     Well, that's a fairly common phenomenon. I mean...uh...it happens.

     CONNOR
     Except Hanson didn't deny it. Told us it might be safer if we
     allowed them to think he was a god for awhile. Said it was
     the...system of government they needed to retake their world.

     DANIEL
     And...you were okay with that?

     CONNOR

     Frakes was our anthropologist. He agreed with Hanson that it might
     be safer. But the longer we stayed here, the stronger they believed.
     In our fourth or fifth week here, a young child wandered out of the
     caves.
     (shakes his head)
     Must have gotten lost. Hanson went out after him. He was gone for
     two full days before he came back, carrying the child, barely alive,
     in his arms.

     CARTER
     The cave dwellers must have loved him for that.

     CONNOR
     Yeah, they did. He wasn't sane after that.

     CARTER
     You're saying that that's what sent him over the edge? The sun?

     CONNOR

     (sighs)
     It wasn't any one thing. If it was, me and Frakes, we could have
     seen it coming. Done something about it, before...

     TEAL'C
     Before what?

     CONNOR
     There were a few cave dwellers who...got the idea that Hanson was
     just a man like they were. Thanks to...Frakes and I. He had them
     tied to stakes and left out in direct sunlight. If they lived seven
     days, they were allowed back in the caves.

     DANIEL
     A number of significant biblical events took place over the course
     of seven days.

     CONNOR

     (staring into the fire)
     By then they were blind. Giant bleeding burns all over them. Just
     took them a little longer to die. Personally, I'd rather eat a
     bullet.

   [Everyone stares at him, stricken. O'Neill looks around at his team.]

     O'NEILL
     I'll take first watch.

   [They sit in silence.]

   EXT--HANSON'S CAMP, NIGHT

   [Hanson exits the cave. He walks to a cliff, looking down to see the
   cave dwellers working by torchlight, digging on ladders on the sides of
   the cliff. Some are moving wagons around on the flat portion of the
   ground.]

   EXT--PLANET, SG-1 CAMP, NIGHT

   [O'Neill is on guard. Connor is sleeping on a pallet on the ground. He
   awakens, quietly rising to his feet. He walks past a sleeping Carter
   and Daniel, past Teal'c, who is meditating, and over to O'Neill.]

     CONNOR
     Hey, Colonel. I'll take watch now.

   [O'Neill looks around into the woods, not looking at Connor . Both spot
   movement in the trees. Connor crouches, and follows O'Neill back into
   the camp. In the woods, the cave dwellers are moving closer. O'Neill
   touches Teal'c, shaking him from his kel-no-reem. He then leans down to
   shake Daniel's shoulder.]

     O'NEILL
     Let's go. We've got company.

     DANIEL
     Are you sure?

   [An arrow hits the tree trunk beside Daniel's head. Both men look at
   it.]

     O'NEILL
     Pretty sure.

   [The cave dwellers move through the trees, setting off the alarm and
   the lights. O'Neill fires his gun towards the invaders. Connor does as
   well. The Cave dwellers shoot their darts. Teal'c waits, finally
   shooting his staff weapon at a tree. It catches fire. The alarms stop.]

     TEAL'C
     It appears they are gone.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     Connor? Connor?

   [They look. Connor is gone.]

   EXT--HANSON'S OPERATION, DAY

   [The torches have been extinguished; there are no people in sight.]

     HANSON
     The temple is taking too long to build.

     BAKER
     They're working as hard as they can.

     HANSON
     But not as long as they can. Divide them into shifts; day and night.

     BAKER
     You can't.

     HANSON
     What?

     BAKER
     They'll die.

     HANSON

     Sacrifice.
     (shrugs)
     Their way to salvation.

   EXT--WOODS

   [Daniel and Carter are walking. O'Neill is behind them, intent on
   keeping guard on the woods around them.]

     DANIEL
     Well, they were probably just instructed just to...take Connor; send
     us a message that Hanson is in control.

     CARTER
     Sounds familiar.

     DANIEL
     Which part?

     CARTER
     He likes control.

     DANIEL
     Well, what did you see in him?

     CARTER

     (grimaces)
     I dunno. I guess I've always had a soft spot for the lunatic fringe.
     He was...He was charming.

     DANIEL
     Well, that's good. Charming is good.

     CARTER
     I don't know, I should be more surprised by this than I am, but I'm
     not. You know, he had this in him Daniel. Too many years of black
     ops.

     DANIEL
     Well, that's typical of our government's evaluation of soldiers. The
     crazier they are, the more extreme the situation they seem to be put
     into.

   [Daniel glances back at O'Neill, who doesn't acknowledge he's been
   listening.]

     CARTER
     I can't really...He wasn't happy when I broke off the engagement,
     but he seemed like he'd really pulled himself together when we met
     up at Stargate Command.

     DANIEL
     Apparently not.

   [Teal'c raises a hand, stopping the group. He puts his finger to his
   lips, motioning for silence. O'Neill pushes past Daniel and Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     What've you got, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     This way.

   [The team follows the path. It comes out at the top of a cliff,
   overseeing the building of the temple. They pause, watching the
   workers. Hundreds of people toil, breaking rocks, moving boulders,
   clearing away rubble.]

     TEAL'C
     The road out of the valley, toward the mountain.

   [O'Neill looks through binoculars in that direction, seeing several men
   tied to stakes in the center of the activity. They are sunburned, their
   heads hanging. Two appear to be natives; Connor is the third man in
   line. He looks exhausted, but he's still alive. O'Neill sighs and
   shakes his head.]

     O'NEILL
     I'll be back in thirty minutes.

     TEAL'C
     If you are thinking about rescuing Connor...

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     Not yet. Captain? When the time comes, I'll need your help to get in
     the front door.

     CARTER

     (nods)
     I'm prepared for that, sir.

   [O'Neill takes off through the woods.]

     TEAL'C
     There will be none left to worship him if this continues.

     DANIEL
     They're like Abraham.

   [Carter and Teal'c look at him, puzzled.]

     TEAL'C
     Who was Abraham?

     DANIEL
     A Biblical figure. Believed to be the father of man. God tested his
     faith by instructing him to make a great sacrifice. His son, Issac.

     TEAL'C

     (frowns)
     Did he sacrifice his son?

     DANIEL

     (nods)
     He gave it a good shot before an angel stopped him. At the last
     minute.

   [Carter looks through the binoculars and sees one of the workers fall.
   Several other men try to catch him. Down at the site, Baker sees it
   too.]

     BAKER
     Get up!

     CAVE DWELLER
     He worked straight through the night. He needs rest.

     BAKER

     Shut up.
     (leans in close, shouting at the fallen man.)
     Do I have to make an example? Do I?

   [The native cringes. Baker swings back his rifle, and hits the worker
   several times. The boy cries out, flinching away as he is hit. His
   friends desert him. Carter hands the binoculars to Teal'c.]

     CARTER
     Hey. Look over there.

   [She points to the beating taking place. As Teal'c looks, Carter rises
   to her feet.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa. Where you going?

     CARTER
     I can't just stay here and watch him beat that man to death.

     TEAL'C
     You will be captured.

     CARTER
     Uh-huh.

     DANIEL
     Uh, and you think that's a plan?

     CARTER
     Daniel, I can get to Hanson. That's what the Colonel was talking
     about.

     DANIEL
     Well, can you at least wait until he gets back?

     CARTER
     The man could be dead by then.

   [Carter takes off.]

     DANIEL
     We should have stopped her.

     TEAL'C
     We would have failed.

   [O'Neill is at the top of another bluff, looking at the proceedings
   from a different angle. Picking up his rifle, he looks through the
   telescopic sight at the prisoners and at Connor.]

   [Teal'c looks through his binoculars at Baker, still beating the young
   native. Carter comes up behind him, pulls the gun away, then punches
   the guard in the face. Baker falls.]

     CARTER
     Well, that was refreshing.

   [O'Neill runs down the path, joining Teal'c and Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     Connor looks bad. There's two guards be...

   [His voice trails off as he sees what's happening below. Carter raises
   her hands, then takes off her rifle as she's taken prisoner.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel.

   [Daniel wordlessly motions to Carter. His mouth moves, but no words
   come out.]

     O'NEILL

     (sighs)
     Never mind. It's probably our only way in without a firefight
     anyway.

   [Carter walks to Hanson's cave, trailed by two native guards and
   Baker.]

   INT--HANSON'S CAVE

   [Baker pushes Carter in front of him with the rifle.]

     CARTER
     All right, all right.

   [The cave is full of people. Fires burn in various spots. Hanson sits
   in a corner, on a large chair obviously meant to be a throne. Three
   young native girls sit at his feet.]

     HANSON

     (throws off his hood)
     Well. It's about time.

     CARTER
     Hello, Jonas.

     HANSON

     (nods and grimaces)
     And you never thought I'd amount to anything. Quite a leap, isn't
     it? From Captain to...

     CARTER

     (interrupting)
     What's happened to you, Jonas?

     HANSON
     Please. Sit down.

   [He motions to a chair. Carter sits.]

     HANSON
     These caves were once mines; they permeate the hillside for miles.
     But these people have been multiplying like rabbits. They don't have
     the technology to dig themselves more space; they don't have the
     courage to leave the caves. It's like a third world country in a
     bottle.

     CARTER
     And you think you're saving them.

     HANSON

     Oh. I know I am.
     (They stare at each other in silence for a moment.)
     These people, they're human beings. They're like us. How can we turn
     our backs on them? Kidnapped from Earth. Forced into slavery for
     centuries...

     CARTER
     We can't change that.

     HANSON
     Yes! We can. We must help.

     CARTER
     Well, how does posing as a god and slowly working these people to
     death help them?

     HANSON
     I hate that word. Stop using it. I am not posing.

   [Carter shakes her head in disbelief.]

     HANSON
     It is a matter of definition. My people need me. They believe in me.
     And because they believe, they work.

     CARTER
     To death.

     HANSON
     We're building a civilization, Sam. There are going to be
     sacrifices. It's better than rotting in caves, living and dying in
     squalor like you've never seen! I'm creating a great people.

     CARTER
     In your image?

     HANSON

     Yes.
     (He smiles.)
     It's going to be wondrous. You'll see. You'll see.

   EXT--BLUFF OVERLOOKING WORK SITE, DAY

     O'NEILL
     All right, we're going to have to get one of them alone. Talk to
     him.

     TEAL'C
     They could give us away.

     DANIEL
     Maybe not.

   [He looks through the binoculars as the young man who was beaten by
   Baker stumbles away from the site.]

     DANIEL
     Maybe not. I think I've got just the candidate.

   EXT--BESIDE A STREAM

   [The young native is bent down, splashing water on his face. He
   examines a wound on his arm, pulling out a cloth to clean it. Daniel
   moves up and squats beside him, giving a friendly wave. The boy
   nervously turns away, but O'Neill moves to stand at his other side. He
   turns to run, but Teal'c is standing behind him. When the boy looks up
   at Teal'c, the Jaffa moves one finger to his lips.]

     TEAL'C
     Shhh.

   INT--HANSON'S CAVE

   [Hanson is examining the cave paintings on the wall. There are pictures
   of an antelope-like animal being hunted by stick figures. An orange
   shape rises above them.]

     HANSON
     I really wish I understood these drawings.

     CARTER
     Why don't you ask your people?

     HANSON

     (spreads his arms ruefully)
     All-knowing.

     CARTER
     You knew I would come, didn't you?

     HANSON
     How could you not? Healer of the emotionally wounded. I was your one
     failure. The bird with the broken wing that wouldn't heal.

     CARTER
     You seem to be flying well enough on your own.

     HANSON
     I'd hoped that you would understand.

   [While Hanson turns his attention away, Carter grabs a pistol, primes
   and aims it at him.]

     CARTER
     I do understand. You're sick and you need help.

     HANSON
     That's your idea of help?

     CARTER
     Yes. You're coming back with me.

     HANSON
     Well, you're going to have to use it, Sam.

   [Carter stares at him, her hand steady.]

     HANSON
     Go on.

   [Carter's hand starts to tremble.]

     HANSON
     It's still loaded. Pull the trigger.

   [Hanson starts to move closer. Carter's hand shakes.]

     HANSON
     Do it!

   [Carter jumps and readjusts her grip.]

     HANSON
     'Cause so help me, that is the only way you're going to stop me.

   [Carter's eyes tear up. Her hand is visibly shaking.]

     HANSON
     What's a few deaths compared to the survival of my people. Killing
     their savior might irritate them a little, but at least I'd be gone.

   [Carter is shaking her head, the gun bobbing up and down.]

     CARTER
     Don't make me do this.

     HANSON

     (whispering)
     Go on, pull the trigger. One more fraction of an inch.

   [Hanson moves closer. Carter blinks back tears. Hanson reaches out and
   takes the gun from Carter's grasp. She chokes back a sob.]

     HANSON
     You had the gun. You appeared to have all the power. Yet I was in
     control. That is the strength of a god.

   EXT--BESIDE STREAM

   [The man that Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c snuck up on is huddled under a
   bush, clearly frightened.]

     JAMALA
     My name is Jamala. Jamala. Please don't kill me. Please don't..

     DANIEL

     (raising hand)
     No! We won't.

     JAMALA
     Jonas said that you would come. Devils with power like him; here to
     destroy us.

     DANIEL

     No! No, we're not devils
     (yanks off sunglasses)
     we're men like yourself. We're uh...I'm Daniel, this is Jack, and
     he's Teal'c.

     O'NEILL
     Hi.

   [He smiles.]

     JAMALA

     (whispers)
     Is he Jaffa?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     JAMALA
     Don't kill me. Please don't

     DANIEL
     No. No, It's okay. He's...friendly.

   [Jamala looks at Teal'c in disbelief.]

     DANIEL
     He's a friend.

   [Daniel stands and walks to stand beside Teal'c, putting his arm around
   Teal'c's shoulder.]

     DANIEL

     See?
     (to Teal'c)
     Smile, look friendly.

   [Teal'c raises his lip in an attempt to smile. It looks more like a
   snarl.]

     O'NEILL
     You're going to have to work on that a little bit.

     DANIEL
     Now, how do you know he is Jaffa? Have you seen one before?

     JAMALA

     (shakes his head)
     No. Just stories from when I was a young boy. Long ago.
     (looks to O'Neill)
     He is a servant of the old gods, yes?

     O'NEILL
     Well, yes and no. He's from another place. So are we.

     JAMALA
     Another place?

     O'NEILL
     Earth. It's way, way out there. Where we're from. Jonas too. See,
     he's not a god, he's just a man. A crazy man, granted but...

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     Okay. Okay. Jonas is bad.

   [Jamala skuttles backward. Daniel rolls his eyes.]

     O'NEILL
     But it's all right. He can't hear you right now. He can't hurt you.

     DANIEL
     But he will if you and your people continue to believe in him and
     follow him.

     JAMALA
     No, he will save us.

     TEAL'C
     By laboring you in the sun until extinction?

     JAMALA
     If we finish the temple, Jonas will make the sky orange. It will be
     safe to come out in the light. There will be no more sickness.

     O'NEILL
     The sky? Orange?

     JAMALA
     The sky. Up there.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I know what the sky is. Why?

     JAMALA
     When the sky is orange, it's good. There's no more sickness.

     TEAL'C
     And Jonas can make the sky orange?

     JAMALA
     Yes. He can.

     TEAL'C
     How do you know?

     JAMALA
     He says he can.

     O'NEILL
     You know what he's talking about?

     TEAL'C
     I believe so.

   EXT--OUTSIDE HANSON'S CAVE, DAY

   [Carter follows Hanson out. He stops and motions to the work going on.]

     HANSON
     Going to be magnificent, isn't it?

     CARTER
     What's the point, Jonas? By the time it's built there'll be no one
     left to worship you.

     HANSON

     Please. Mere survival for these people will require unquestioning
     faith. Pure devotion. They must believe in me. If I am to lead them
     into the desert, to the Promised Land. I'm merely separating the
     wheat from the chaff.
     (his voice changes)
     Besides, I'm supposed to be crazy, right?

     CARTER
     I never said you were crazy.

     HANSON

     But you think it, don't you?
     (laughs)
     Well, that's all right. I still have faith in you, even if you don't
     believe in me. Yet. You'll come around.

     CARTER
     I don't think so, Jonas.

   [Hanson frowns, studying her face. He grabs her arm.]

     HANSON
     Come here.

   EXT--WOODS

   [On a small notepad, Teal'c sketches a shape similar to the object in
   the cave paintings.]

     DANIEL
     What is it?

     TEAL'C
     It is something I have seen the Goa'ulds use. It creates an energy
     force high in the air.

     DANIEL
     What, protection from radiation? Like...like this planet's sun?

     TEAL'C
     The device I saw appeared to turn the sky orange.

     JAMALA
     The cave paintings tell of this. They show this symbol.

     O'NEILL
     Have you ever actually seen one of these things he's talking about?

   [Jamala nods.]

     DANIEL
     Where?

   INT--HANSON'S CAVE

   [Hanson strides in, Carter behind him. He whips off a curtain, and
   leads her to a material-covered object. He pulls off the material to
   reveal an actual device like the one Teal'c has just drawn.]

     CARTER
     What is it?

     HANSON

     (shrugs)
     Looks like something the Goa'ulds left behind. What I've gathered
     from the local folklore is that the ancient...gods used it to make
     the sky orange, to protect the people from the sun sickness.

     CARTER
     Some sort of shield.

     HANSON
     Yes.

     CARTER
     You don't know how to work it.

     HANSON
     Not my area of expertise.

     CARTER

     (snorts)
     You never cared about my coming here because you wanted me, Jonas.
     You just wanted me to figure out how to turn this thing on for you.

     HANSON

     Oh, no. That's not true.
     (He puts his hands on her arms, staring at her)
     I sincerely hope that one day, you will agree to be my goddess.

   [Carter is unmoved.]

     HANSON
     Turn it on.

     CARTER
     What if I won't?

     HANSON

     (intently)
     Then we will watch every last cave dweller die in the sun before I
     kill us both.

   [He walks away to stand on the other side of the device.]

     HANSON

     (proclaiming)
     "He hath not failed one word of His good promises."

   [Hanson reaches into his robe and pulls out a small bible.]

     HANSON

     I've been carrying this for years. All along, I've been looking for
     God...
     (shrugs and looks heavenward)
     ...And here I am.

   EXT -- WOODS, DAY

   [Jamala, dressed in O'Neill's uniform, is speaking with Teal'c. Behind
   them, O'Neill, dressed in Jamala's clothing, with pants, is smearing
   his face with camouflage makeup, to look like dirt.]

     JAMALA
     So...you betrayed your gods, as I am betraying mine?

     TEAL'C
     The beings I betrayed were not gods. They had power, but power alone
     does not make one a god. Do you understand?"

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     I can't leave Connor out there another day. He'll die.

     DANIEL
     We also have to do something about Captain Carter. But if Teal'c can
     turn on this device, we could seriously undermine Hanson's power.

   [O'Neill wraps a cloth around his head, similar to the natives'
   headcovering.]

     TEAL'C
     There is a problem with your plan, Daniel.

     DANIEL
     Wait, don't tell me you don't know how to turn it on?

     TEAL'C
     Yes, I can turn it on. But there must be two.

     DANIEL
     What are you talking about?

     TEAL'C
     The shield technology involves a force field being bounced back and
     forth between two devices.

     JAMALA
     I have only seen one, in his cave.

     DANIEL
     Hanson may not know he needs a second device.

   [Pulling out the small notebook, Teal'c draws triangles to represent
   the surrounding mountains.]

     TEAL'C
     This is the valley. Here is the Stargate.

   [He draws a circle on one end to represent the Stargate, and a building
   on the other.]

     TEAL'C
     Here is the temple.

   [Teal'c points to the sketch of the building.]

     JAMALA

     (sounding impressed)
     Good drawing.

     TEAL'C
     Thank you. Where was the first device found?

   [Jamala points to a spot near the Stargate. Teal'c marks an x near
   where Jamala pointed.]

     TEAL'C
     Then the second device is...

   [Teal'c places a second x and circles it; all the way across the valley
   and near the temple. He draws an arc, joining the two and making a
   shield over the valley.]

     O'NEILL
     You're assuming the Goa'ulds just shut them down and left them in
     place.

     TEAL'C
     That is correct.

     O'NEILL
     I'm sorry Teal'c, but your calculations could be way off. Connor
     doesn't have time for us to be wrong. I'll go after him. You try and
     find that second device. I'll try to meet you back here.

   [O'Neill leaves.]

   EXT -- WOODS, DAY

   [Teal'c and Daniel follow Jamala through the woods. Where Teal'c had
   placed the x, they discover a ruined temple; but there is no shield
   device in sight.]

     JAMALA
     This place is like where the other one was found on the far side of
     the temple.

   [Daniel and Jamala walk up steps and kneel on what was the floor of the
   temple. Daniel begins wiping debris off the stones.]

     DANIEL
     Agh. This is like solid rock, well never be able to get through
     this.

   [Teal'c joins Daniel and Jamala. He taps the platform with the end of
   his staff weapon. Nothing happens, but the tapping sounds hollow.]

     TEAL'C
     Stand aside.

   [Daniel looks up at Teal'c, then jumps up, grabbing and pushing Jamala
   off the platform and into the woods. Teal'c moves off the platform. He
   aims and fires his staff weapon at the stone floor. A large, perfectly
   circular hole is the result. Daniel runs to it, Teal'c and Jamala
   follow.]

     DANIEL

     (looking down into the hole)
     Ah. I just hope it still functions.

   EXT -- HANSON'S OPERATION, DAY

   [O'Neill makes his way toward the poles. He stops behind one of the
   mined blocks of stone and pulls out a blowgun. He aims at one of the
   guards and blows. The dart hits the guard in the chest; the man passes
   out and falls down the cliff. O'Neill walks up to Connor, who is
   slumped against the pole, his eyes closed.]

     CONNOR
     Kill me.

     O'NEILL
     Are you sure? I've come all this way.

   [Connor's head snaps up in surprise. O'Neill unties him.]

     O'NEILL
     Can you walk?

     CONNOR
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Let's go.

   [O'Neill takes Connor's arm, supporting him as they start slowly
   walking away. Both duck their heads as several workers and a guard pass
   them.]

     O'NEILL
     Think we can pick up the pace a little bit here?

   [There is a shout from behind them, Baker walks out from behind another
   stone block, several guards following him. Baker cocks his gun. O'Neill
   and Connor stop. They turn around. The guards surround the O'Neill and
   Connor .]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, how you doing? You know we'd love to stick around but some
     brain-dead sycophant left my buddy out here to die. So we're out of
     here.

   [Baker backhands O'Neill across the face.]

     O'NEILL
     Ow.

   [Baker takes O'Neill's gun and knife.]

     BAKER
     Move.

   [He pushes O'Neill, and they all start to walk.]

   INT -- HANSON'S CAVE

   [Carter is analyzing the shield device.]

     CARTER
     The main control board seems to follow the same basic circuitry
     patterns as the Gate technology.

     HANSON

     (uninterested)
     Just turn it on.

     CARTER
     What if I can't?

   [O'Neill and Connor are pushed into the cave.]

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     Captain.
     (sarcastically)
     I see everything's working out just as we planned.

   [O'Neill raises his eyebrows. Hanson walks up to O'Neill and uncuffs
   his hands.]

     HANSON
     Shoot him!

     CARTER
     No! All right I'll...

     O'NEILL
     Wait, you're going to turn this thing on in here?

     HANSON
     Do it now. If it works, I'll spare him.

   [Carter looks to O'Neill, who nods and waves her to do it. Carter turns
   the device on; an orange beam of light shoots up into the sky. Nothing
   else happens.]

     HANSON
     It's beautiful.

   EXT -- WOODS

   [Daniel wipes debris from the second shield device. Teal'c is
   watching.]

     DANIEL
     Will it work?

     TEAL'C
     I do not know.

   [Jamala runs at top speed towards Daniel and Teal'c.]

     JAMALA
     Everyone is being forced to gather at the circle of the gods.

     DANIEL
     The Stargate.

   EXT -- STARGATE

   [The Stargate has been tilted so that it's flat on the ground. The
   stairs now provide an improvised stage above the Stargate. Connor and
   O'Neill kneel on this platform, their hands tied. Baker stands behind
   them, holding a gun. Hanson stands beyond that, beside the first shield
   device. Natives surround the Gate, gazing at Hanson.]

     HANSON
     My children. Today is a great day! "The sun hath stood still in the
     heavens, and hastened not to go down about a whole day. I have the
     power to help, and to cast down. But fear not, stand still, and see
     the salvation of the Lord."

   [As Hanson crosses to the DHD, Carter is revealed, standing on the
   stairs, her hands bound.]

     HANSON
     Today, we will bury the doorway that brings forth demons who
     threaten to undo us. But first...I will send those evil undoers who
     have already invaded our world, back to the hell from whence they
     came.

   [Hanson points to O'Neill and Connor . He turns, and presses the
   symbols on the DHD for Earth.]

     HANSON
     Fear not, for I the lord your god, control the gateway to the
     underworld.

   [Hanson presses the crystal in the center of the DHD. The natives jump
   as the wormhole is engaged. The even horizon shoots straight up, in a
   tower of what looks like water. The natives cower in fear. Carter
   stares.]

     CARTER
     You said you wouldn't kill them.

     HANSON
     I'm not, I'm sending them back to Earth.

     CARTER
     Without sending the signal to open the iris, they'll die.

     HANSON

     (sarcastically)
     Please, Sam, I'm having a moment here.
     (to the crowd)
     I am the lord your god; there is nothing I cannot do. No one is
     greater then I. No one is more powerful than I.
     (to Baker, quietly)
     Throw them in.

   [O'Neill and Connor are pushed to the edge of the rock platform
   overlooking the wormhole. As they look down, Daniel appears. He jumps
   up onto a rock, where he can oversee the crowd.]

     DANIEL
     Wait! Stop!

   [Jamala shoots Baker with Teal'c's staff weapon before he can fire.]

     JAMALA
     Back away!

   [Hanson pulls out a gun; Carter jumps, and kicks it out of his hands.
   Hanson whirls around and backhands her. As Hanson and Carter fight,
   Jamala shoots the staff again; the blast just misses Hanson. He stops
   and turns, losing interest in Carter, who's on the ground.]

     DANIEL
     Listen to me, no matter what Jonas has shown you or done for you, he
     is not a god.

     HANSON
     Don't listen to him! They are demons, agents of the devil! I am your
     savior!

     O'NEILL
     We're not demons, for cryin' out loud!

     DANIEL
     This...

   [Daniel jumps to the ground, picks up a gun and jumps back up on the
   rock again.]

     DANIEL
     This...this is not magical power. It is called a gun, and it is a
     machine.

   [Daniel makes the clip fall out. The natives gasp.]

     HANSON
     Do as I say! Or you will all die!

     O'NEILL
     Do as he says and you WILL die.

     HANSON
     Do not betray me; after all I have done for you! I promised you I
     would bring you out of the caves, into the light. Today I fulfill
     that promise.

   [He moves to the shield device.]

     HANSON

     Behold...the magical power that belongs to your god!
     (he points to himself)
     I give you the sun.

   [Hanson turns the device on.]

     HANSON
     I give you the world!

   [Again, the orange light goes straight up. The natives cower and stare
   expectantly, but the light does nothing more. As O'Neill gets the ropes
   off his wrists, Hanson goes over to Carter. He jerks her by her vest.]

     HANSON
     What's wrong?

     CARTER
     I don't know!

     HANSON
     Fix it!

     DANIEL
     It's the machine. I can make it work, and so can you, just like
     Jamala there can fire that staff. Now, I'll show you how. There are
     two devices. And both must be turned on for the shield to work.
     Watch.

   [Daniel nods to Jamala, who shoots the staff weapon into the air. On
   the other side of the valley, Teal'c sees the shot. He turns on the
   other shield, a beam of orange light shoots into the sky. His light
   arcs toward the other, and the two beams hook together like a rainbow.
   A large orange dome forms.]

     MAN
     Look! Look!

   [After a quick look around at the natives, Hanson grabs Carter.]

     HANSON
     I'm taking you with me!

   [O'Neill pushes Connor out of the way and tackles Hanson. Both men and
   Carter fall of the platform and to the ground. The natives rebel as one
   in an angry wave. They attack Hanson, picking him up. Working with one
   mind, they toss Hanson into the wormhole. Carter looks on, shocked and
   sad. There was no chance to dial the iris code.]

   EXT -- STARGATE, DAY

   [The Stargate is upright again. The sky is still orange. SG-1, Jamala,
   Connor and a few natives are hovering. Carter walks over to O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     Uh, I think we're ready.

     O'NEILL
     Think we should tell them to bury the Gate after were gone?

     CARTER
     Teal'c seems to think the Goa'ulds won't be back.

   [Daniel joins them.]

     DANIEL
     Maybe we should come back and check on these guys.

     CARTER
     I think we've done enough, don't you?

   [Daniel looks at her, then nods and walks away.]

     O'NEILL
     Something else on your mind?

     CARTER
     I had the chance to end this, Colonel. He literally asked me to do
     it.

     O'NEILL
     Killing a man is no badge of honor, Captain.

     CARTER
     I know.

     O'NEILL

     Look, I'm no expert on this thing.
     (waves Hanson's bible)
     I generally remember one commandment, and I think it's the first.

     CARTER
     "I am the Lord your God, and you shall take no other Gods before
     me?"

     O'NEILL

     (stops and makes a face)
     Okay, it's not the first one. I'm talking about the "No Killing"
     one. No matter what the reason, every time you break it, you take
     one step closer to Hanson.

   [He looks at Carter, who nods.]

     CARTER
     Thanks.

   [O'Neill hands her the bible, then goes to where the rest of SG-1 and
   the villagers are talking.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Jamala)
     So, you gonna be all right?

     JAMALA

     Yes.
     (He shakes O'Neill's hand)
     The world outside the caves...it's very big, yes?

     DANIEL
     Yeah...it's bigger then you can imagine.

   [Daniel and Jamala shake hands. Daniel walks and to DHD and dials
   Earth. Carter transmits the iris code. SG-1 and Connor walk through the
   Gate. The natives watch them go, Jamala at their head. He looks up at
   the orange dome, which is now keeping his people safe.]
