     O'NEILL
     Barber. When you get there, give this to Daniel, will you?

     BARBER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     We had a bet. I lost.

     CARTER
     What'd you bet on?

     O'NEILL
     Sports related. Just give it to him. He'll know what it means.

     BARBER
     Yes, Sir.

     What sport?

     O'NEILL
     Hmm?

     CARTER
     What sport did you bet on?

     O'NEILL
     Curling.

     CARTER
     Daniel bet on curling?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yes. His team won the big Bonspiel.

     CARTER
     Okay. You don't want to tell me what the bet is, that's fine.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Have fun.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter and O'Neill walk down from the control room along the corridor
   towards the Gate room.]

     CARTER
     So, Sir, are you sure you'd rather take the weekend off than come
     with me to see this place?

     O'NEILL
     Ahh, you know I get that way when I work my ass off. In fact, I'd
     have figured you'd want some time off yourself by now.

     CARTER
     Oh, I do but Daniel says that of all the...That was the bet? Whether
     or not I'd go? Don't you have anything better to do?

   [Barber starts to run up the ramp.]

     O'NEILL
     Barber!

   [Barber is disintegrated by the wormhole engaging.]

     CARTER
     Oh my God!

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel and SG-5 walk down the ramp from the Gate. O'Neill is waiting
   for Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, you've got to see this.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel. There's been an incident.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I know, I got your message, but this is really important.
     There is this light in this amazing...

     O'NEILL
     Barber's dead.

     DANIEL
     What?

     O'NEILL
     Come on.

   INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, Teal'c and Hammond sit around the table.]

     HAMMOND
     Did Lieutenant Barber show any signs of depression while on the
     mission?

     DANIEL
     The opposite. He was fine.

     O'NEILL
     How long had he been back?

     CARTER
     Well, he hadn't been even been Earthside for forty-eight hours.

     O'NEILL
     What was he doing?

     TEAL'C
     Awaiting the results of a translation with which I was assisting
     Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     If you're asking me if he was suicidal, he wasn't. He was fine--he
     was better than fine. Didn't anyone talk to him or, like, notice
     anything?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing.

     CARTER
     We were all taken by surprise.

     DANIEL
     Well, so am I. I don't even know what to say.

     HAMMOND
     We'll continue to investigate what may have compelled him to do what
     he did, but it's been my experience that these questions often go
     unanswered.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Jackson, perhaps you can tell us more about this Goa'uld palace
     you were studying? Dr. Jackson?

     DANIEL
     Yes. Ahh sorry. Umm...

     TEAL'C
     Were there any signs of recent Goa'uld activity?

     DANIEL
     No. I'm pretty sure no one has been there for hundreds of years but
     there was this room where there was this pedestal which projected
     this light matrix hologram onto the ceiling and it was...absolutely
     stunning.

     HAMMOND
     Any idea to its purpose?

     DANIEL
     Ideas, yes, but I was hoping this might tell me more.

   [Daniel reaches into a case on the table and pulls out a small hand
   device.]

     DANIEL
     It's kind of like a Goa'uld hand held computer. When it's turned on,
     it displays this Goa'uld dialect I've never seen before, and there
     are similar writings all over the pillars of the palace. I'm
     thinking or hoping--crossing my fingers, actually--that they're
     instructions.

     TEAL'C
     I would be happy to provide further assistance with the translation,
     Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     Thank you. I was counting on it.

   EXT--STOCK SHOT, MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, NIGHT

   INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill enters. Teal'c is sitting at a computer screen. Daniel is
   restlessly pacing the office.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey. What're you watching?

     TEAL'C
     A digital image. I am endeavouring to translate the Goa'uld writings
     of which Daniel Jackson had spoken.

     O'NEILL
     How goes the endeavouring?

     TEAL'C
     Upon a second viewing I have discovered a figure moving in the
     background. It does not appear to be one of our personnel.

   [Daniel slams a book down on the desk and looks at the hand device in
   frustration. O'Neill and Teal'c look at him suspiciously.]

     O'NEILL
     He never mentioned anyone else.

     DANIEL
     What is wrong with this thing? This thing isn't working.

     O'NEILL
     Did you check the batteries?

     DANIEL
     I need to go back to the planet and figure out what's going on.

     O'NEILL
     Hammond suggested we do that tomorrow.

     DANIEL
     Well, this thing isn't working, and tomorrow isn't good enough.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, it is.

     DANIEL
     I'm going to talk to Hammond.

   [Daniel walks out.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey!

   [O'Neill goes after Daniel.]

   INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is standing leaning on the desk Hammond is seated at. O'Neill
   is leaning with his back against the wall.]

     HAMMOND
     Have you slept at all since you returned?

     DANIEL
     I fail to see what that has to do with anything.

     HAMMOND
     SG-1 has been hard at it for weeks. I'm not sending you anywhere
     until you've all had at least a night's sleep.

     DANIEL
     I'm fine.

     HAMMOND
     You're physically and mentally exhausted.

     DANIEL
     I admit I may have been pushing myself a bit, but this device could
     hold the key to everything about that entire place, and I can't make
     any more progress on it here.

     HAMMOND
     You're scheduled to leave tomorrow morning. One more day isn't going
     to make a difference.

     DANIEL
     I'm telling you it is.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you for your time, Sir.

     DANIEL
     You know, it is beyond my comprehension how anybody like yourself
     who has so much power can miss the point entirely.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, knock it off!

     HAMMOND
     It's all right, Colonel. This letter is to Lieutenant Barber's
     family explaining that he died in the service of his country. I've
     spent the last two hours on it. I can't tell them anything about how
     he died or anything about the work he did here, only that he's gone.
     Do you get the point?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir, he does.

     HAMMOND
     Get him out of here.

   [Daniel walks out. O'Neill hesitates, then follows.]

   EXT--STOCK SHOT, MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, DAY

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter are geared up ready to Gate out.]

     HAMMOND
     What's the delay?

     CARTER
     Daniel hasn't reported in this morning, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     What?

     CARTER
     I just called him. I think he picked up, but now I just get a busy
     signal.

     HAMMOND
     Yesterday he was demanding to leave immediately.

     O'NEILL
     Maybe I should give him a wake-up call, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Sounds to me like he could use one.

   EXT--DANIEL'S APARTMENT, TOP FLOOR OF A FOUR-STORY BLOCK

   INT--DANIEL'S APARTMENT

   [O'Neill pushes open the front door, which is ajar.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

   [O'Neill walks into the apartment and closes the door behind him. Sound
   of the busy tone on the phone that is off the hook on the sideboard.
   Daniel's glasses are there too. sound of the kettle whistling on the
   stove. O'Neill approaches the kitchen, then turns. The balcony door is
   open. The apartment seems empty. O'Neill approaches the balcony door
   and sees Daniel standing out on the ledge, over the rail. Daniel is
   holding onto the rail leaning forward, looking like he is about to
   jump. His eyes are closed, and he's dressed casually.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

   [O'Neill steps into the doorway but doesn't go out onto the balcony.]

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing out here?

     DANIEL
     None of it means anything.

     O'NEILL
     Um. Daniel, why don't you come inside here?

     DANIEL
     I tried. It just goes away.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Then we'll get it back.

     DANIEL
     You can't get it back.

     O'NEILL
     Whatever's wrong, we'll...we'll fix it.

   [Daniel's head is bowed; he's obviously upset.]

     DANIEL
     You don't even know what I'm talking about.

     O'NEILL
     No. No I don't. But come inside.

   [There's a sudden change. Daniel looks around like he's just woken up.]

     DANIEL
     Jack?

   [O'Neill quickly steps out onto the balcony and grabs Daniel's arm.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [O'Neill rubs Daniel's shoulder and arm, holding him there while Daniel
   looks about, confused.]

   INT--SGC, INFIRMARY

   [Daniel is lying in a bed, oxygen monitor on his finger, oxygen tubes
   in his nose, a whole host of monitor wires running up from under his
   medical gown. He is unconscious. Fraiser is standing behind a computer
   screen showing a PET scan. O'Neill is standing at the foot of Daniel's
   bed with Hammond.]

     FRAISER
     The PET scan reveals his neurological activity is slowing.

     O'NEILL
     So?

     FRAISER
     Neurotransmitters relay messages within the body. Too many or too
     few of these chemicals transmissions can result in anxiety,
     depression, or a number of emotional or physical disorders.

     O'NEILL
     Does this have anything to do with Barber's thing?

     FRAISER
     The remaining members of SG-5 are reporting almost identical
     symptoms. Yes, it seems almost certain. Now the only good news is
     that it doesn't seem to be the result of a contagion.

     O'NEILL
     Well, if it's not a disease, what?

     FRAISER
     I don't know. Such a drastic shift in levels is generally
     drug-induced, but all of their systems are void of any foreign
     substances. Not to mention that preliminary MALP readings of P4X-347
     have ruled out all the usual suspects--air, radiation...

     O'NEILL
     So if we retrace SG-5's tracks we may be able to come up with
     something?

     HAMMOND
     I'm afraid so, Colonel, until we get a grasp on in.

     O'NEILL
     General, we saw the shadow on the video. Now something or someone is
     affecting these guys.

     FRAISER
     More than affecting them, Sir. If their brain function continues to
     fail, they could be facing a worst-case scenario.

     O'NEILL
     So we go in MOP2, and bring back samples of the usual suspects.

     HAMMOND
     You've made your case, Colonel. Watch your step.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Sir.

   STOCK SHOT, GATE TRAVEL THROUGH THE WORMHOLE

   INT--GOA'ULD PALACE

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter step through the Gate wearing environmental
   masks.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, I can see why Daniel was so hot on this place.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     O'NEILL
     What'cha got?

     CARTER
     The air's fine, just like the MALP indicated. Whatever affected
     Daniel and SG-5, they didn't breathe it in.

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c remove their masks.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay, watch your step.

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c start to look around. They see a shadow
   moving between the pillars. They approach cautiously. The shadow is a
   boy.]

     CARTER
     It's just a kid. Obviously scared to death of us.

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c step into a room in which a blue/purple
   light is being projected from the top of a pedestal over the ceiling
   and down the walls.]

     TEAL'C
     I believe this is the room of light of which Daniel Jackson has
     spoken.

     O'NEILL
     Really? Carter, what are we looking at here?

     CARTER
     Ahh, it doesn't seem to be giving off any detectable radiation,
     other than visible light. I think it's just decorative.

     O'NEILL
     Safe?

     TEAL'C
     It is most difficult to believe that something so beautiful could be
     dangerous, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     No.

   [Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c stare at the light, almost hypnotised.
   O'Neill looks away with some difficulty.]

     O'NEILL
     Phew. We'll come back to look at it. Let's go.

   [O'Neill walks out of the room. Carter and Teal'c remain staring at the
   light.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, let's go.

     CARTER
     Right. Sorry, Sir.

   INT--PALACE CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c are walking along.]

     CARTER
     Sir, I'd like to perform a full spectrum analysis on that light.

     O'NEILL
     Later.

     CARTER
     I think there might be a relationship between the light and what's
     happening to Daniel.

     O'NEILL
     Thought you said it wasn't dangerous?

     CARTER
     I'm sure it isn't, Sir, it's just...

   [Carter approaches a slightly open door, weapon aimed as she peers
   inside. O'Neill pushes the door open slowly and steps inside the room.
   Carter and Teal'c follow. O'Neill finds the boy, Loran, hiding behind a
   pillar.]

     O'NEILL
     Hi. I'm Jack. And you are...? Nice digs. Kind of remind me of my
     first apartment. How are the people upstairs?

     LORAN
     Loran.

     O'NEILL
     I'm sorry, I don't know what Loran means.

     LORAN
     It's me.

     O'NEILL
     Hi, Loran.

     LORAN
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Anyone else live here with you?

     LORAN
     Mother and father.

     O'NEILL
     Can you take me to them? I'd like to talk to them.

     LORAN
     No. They're not here.

     O'NEILL
     Not in this place? So you're here alone?

     LORAN
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Well, Loran, some of my people came here a few days ago.

     LORAN
     I was hiding.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well you hide very well, because they didn't even know you
     were here. The thing is, when they came home they all got very sick.
     We'd like to figure out why. Do you know?

   [Loran shakes his head no.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay, well, we're going to have to look around a little more. Maybe
     you should come along?

     CARTER

     (voice over radio)
     Colonel. General Hammond has activated the Gate and is on the radio.

     O'NEILL
     All right go ahead. I'll be there. Come on.

   INT--MAIN PALACE GATE ROOM

   [The MALP camera is activated. Carter and Teal'c are seen coming in to
   the room by the camera. O'Neill approaches the camera, followed by
   Loran.]

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM.

   [Hammond is standing in front of the MALP computer screen.]

     HAMMOND
     This is Hammond. Come in, Colonel.

   [On the screen we see O'Neill and Loran talking.]

     LORAN
     Where is he?

     O'NEILL
     He's just sending his voice over the radio through this thing here.
     We read you, General.

     HAMMOND
     I see you've made a friend, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir. Loran, General Hammond.

     LORAN
     He can see me?

     HAMMOND
     Yes I can, Son.

     LORAN
     Hi.

     O'NEILL
     We haven't found anything yet, Sir, but we've only been at it a few
     minutes.

     HAMMOND
     It's been well over an hour, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that can't be.

     HAMMOND
     Jack, I have some bad news. All of SG-5 are dead.

   INT--PALACE GATE ROOM

     CARTER
     Oh, no.

     TEAL'C
     What of the condition of Daniel Jackson?

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Fraiser's doing everything she can, but I'm afraid he's fallen
     into a deep coma. We don't know how much time he has left.

   INT--SGC, GATE ROOM

   [The iris opens and the wormhole engages. O'Neill steps through and
   walks down the ramp to be greeted by Fraiser and a medic. O'Neill hands
   Fraiser a large vial.]

     O'NEILL
     Here are your samples.

     FRAISER
     Did you get the boy's?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, it's in there.

     FRAISER
     Get this off to the lab.

   [Fraiser hands the vial to the medic, who leaves the Gate room.]

     O'NEILL
     How's he doing?

     FRAISER
     I'm afraid his condition is unchanged, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [Carter is working, but she is drawn back to stare at the light.]

   INT--PALACE, LORAN'S ROOM

   [Teal'c is holding a photo of Loran and his Mother and Father.]

     TEAL'C
     So approximately how long ago was this image recorded?

     LORAN
     That's my home. Before we came here.

     TEAL'C
     So your parents brought you here from another world?

     LORAN
     Yeah. They were explorers. Kind of like you I guess. So they came
     here then...What was it that we were looking for?

     TEAL'C
     If you cannot give us an explanation to our friend's illness, we
     must continue to search for clues as to what may have caused it.

     LORAN
     Well, none of your friends are in here. Hey, I have to show you
     something. This was a present from my father on my birthday.

   [Loran fetches out a toy phaser weapon. Teal'c draws his zat gun.]

     LORAN
     No, it's not real.

   [Loran offers Teal'c the toy. Teal'c takes it.]

     TEAL'C
     Children of the Tau'ri also seem to enjoy colourful weapons that
     have no function.

     LORAN
     It's fun.

   [Teal'c activates the toy. The tip lights up different colours and
   there is a sound of a phaser.]

     TEAL'C
     I see. On my home world of Chulak we do not celebrate the
     anniversary of one's birth.

     LORAN
     No presents?

     TEAL'C
     It is a day like any other.

     LORAN
     Well, how do you know how old you are?

     TEAL'C
     I am one hundred and one years of age.

     LORAN
     You don't look that old.

     TEAL'C
     So I have been told.

     LORAN
     So when do you turn 102?

     TEAL'C
     In forty-seven days.

   [Teal'c offers the toy back.]

     LORAN
     Keep it. It's a birthday present.

     TEAL'C
     I cannot.

     LORAN
     In forty-seven days you'll be gone. Right? You keep it.

   [Teal'c activates the toy again and smiles.]

   INT--SGC, INFIRMARY

   [Daniel is still unconscious on the bed. The sound of monitors
   measuring his heart rate and brain functions. O'Neill is sitting on the
   bed next to Daniel's. Fraiser is checking another patient on a bed
   behind them. O'Neill gets up and walks to the foot of Daniel's bed. He
   picks up a medical chart on a metal clip board and slams it down on a
   trolley, leaning his elbows on the trolley and putting his head in his
   hands.]

     FRAISER
     Colonel? Are you all right?

     O'NEILL
     What kind of dumb-ass question is that? My friend is lying here on
     his deathbed. I'm fine.

     FRAISER
     We're working on the problem, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     I don't want excuses!

     FRAISER
     Colonel O'Neill, if you don't calm down right now, I will have you
     removed from my infirmary. Is that clear?

     O'NEILL
     I'm fine.

     FRAISER
     Sir, I'd like to recheck your dopamine levels.

     O'NEILL
     It's happening to me, isn't it?

     FRAISER
     Let me find out, please.

   [O'Neill is lying on a bed. A medic has checked his blood pressure.
   Hammond approaches.]

     FRAISER
     Whatever's causing this actually accelerates neural activity in the
     brain and causes a dopamine- like effect in the body.

     O'NEILL
     Kind of like drugs.

     FRAISER
     Only as long as you're on the planet. Shortly after you returned,
     neural activity begins to decrease and depression results. Bloodwork
     confirms it.

     HAMMOND
     Does the boy carry any immunity we could use to our advantage?

     FRAISER
     No. His bloodwork came back the same. I don't think he'll be able to
     leave the planet without experiencing the same narcotic withdrawal
     symptoms.

     HAMMOND
     But Colonel 'Neill was only on that planet for a little over an
     hour.

     FRAISER
     Yes, Sir, this addiction appears to be almost instantaneous.

     O'NEILL
     You're telling me I'm addicted to that place?

     FRAISER
     The intensity of your mood swing into depression seems to be
     proportional to the time you spent on the planet. All we can do is
     hope that your exposure wasn't long enough for your symptoms to get
     as bad as they did with Daniel and the others.

     O'NEILL
     Great. All those years of just saying no.

     HAMMOND
     Jack, I tried to recall Major Carter or Teal'c. They haven't
     responded, and I can't risk sending another team.

   [Daniel's monitor starts to beep.]

     O'NEILL
     What's that?

     FRAISER
     His EEG is sporadic. This is exactly what happened to the members of
     SG-5 before they died. Sir you're going to have to take him back to
     the planet.

   INT--SGC, CORRIDOR

   [Medics, O'Neill and Fraiser are rushing Daniel on a gurney along the
   corridor.]

     FRAISER
     Once you're there I'll need you to send me his vital signs every...

   [The ECG flatlines.]

     FRAISER
     He's coding. No time to resuscitate. Let's go!

   [They enter the Gate room. The Gate is already active. They stop at the
   base of the ramp. O'Neill lifts an unconscious Daniel over his
   shoulders and carries him up the ramp and through the Gate.]

   INT--PALACE, GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill dumps Daniel on the floor, cradling his head as he follows him
   down.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel. Daniel. Come on, come on. Dammit. Daniel. Let's go, come on.

   [O'Neill attempts to revive Daniel by shaking his shoulders and
   smacking his cheeks.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter! Teal'c!

   [Loran appears from behind a pillar.]

     O'NEILL
     Where are my friends?

     LORAN
     With the light.

     O'NEILL
     Get them for me, will you?

     LORAN
     They won't come.

     O'NEILL
     Well, try!

   [Daniel starts to come to.]

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [O'Neill walks in, Loran stays outside.]

     LORAN
     I'm not allowed to go in there.

   [O'Neill shakes Carter, who is standing staring at the light with
   Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     For God's sake. Carter! Carter, wake up.

     CARTER
     You're back, Sir! When?

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c? Teal'c come on. Yeah, come on out of here right now.

   INT--PALACE, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel is sitting on the Gate platform, arms folded across his knees,
   head on his arms. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c enter.]

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson.

     O'NEILL
     Yep. Had to bring him back. It was the only thing that was going to
     keep him alive.

   [O'Neill sits down beside Daniel on the platform.]

     CARTER
     Sir, how long were you gone?

     O'NEILL
     Few hours. Hammond tried to contact you.

     TEAL'C
     He did not.

     LORAN
     He did. I heard his voice.

     CARTER
     Where were we?

     LORAN
     In there.

     CARTER
     I can't explain it, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Fraiser thinks we're all addicted to something here that alters our
     brain chemistry. And dollars to doughnuts, it's that damn light.

     CARTER
     Oh, I don't see how that's possible.

     O'NEILL

     (to Loran)
     Hey. You knew, didn't you?

     LORAN
     No.

     O'NEILL
     That's why you're not allowed in there.

     LORAN
     My father said I was too young.

     O'NEILL
     Uh-huh.

     CARTER
     Sir, if it's the light itself, then how did Daniel recover just by
     arriving on the planet?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know, Major, but I want you to find out. Otherwise we're
     stuck here indefinitely, and that's not acceptable. Ahh, screw it,
     we're shutting that thing off.

   [O'Neill heads out of the room.]

     LORAN
     No.

     O'NEILL
     You stay here.

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [Carter and O'Neill are looking around.]

     CARTER
     What are we looking for, Sir?

     O'NEILL
     The off switch. All right, if we can't shut the thing off...we'll...

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

     O'NEILL
     Aww, man. Damn, that thing's dangerous.

     CARTER
     My guess is the control mechanism is somewhere inside this pedestal.
     If we focus our attention, on that we should be all right.

   INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond is standing in front of the MALP computer. We see Daniel on
   the screen, back in the palace.]

     HAMMOND
     Glad to see you're alive and well, Dr. Jackson. We thought we'd lost
     you.

     DANIEL
     To be honest, I don't really remember much after yelling at you.
     Sorry about that, by the way.

     HAMMOND
     That's all right. Is there anything you need?

     DANIEL
     Glasses. Um, supplies. It looks like we're not going anywhere for a
     while. And that little remote computer thing I couldn't make work
     before.

     HAMMOND
     I'll send it through immediately. Where's Colonel O'Neill?

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [Daniel walks in.]

     DANIEL
     Guys, I've figured out how to...

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are standing staring at the light. Daniel
   activates the hand-held device. The light switches off.]

     CARTER
     How did you do that?

     DANIEL
     Remote control.

     O'NEILL
     I thought that thing was broken.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you were right--it was the batteries.

     O'NEILL
     I was?

     DANIEL
     At least, I think it draws power from something in the room itself.
     That's why I couldn't get it to work back on Earth.

     O'NEILL
     How long were we standing here?

     DANIEL
     I'm not sure. General Hammond sent some supplies and Loran and I
     figured out how to translate the writing on this thing, so...

     O'NEILL
     That long?

     DANIEL
     Well, perception of time is one of the first things to go when
     you're...high. From what I've been able to translate so far with
     Loran's help, the Goa'uld used to use this place as some sort of
     opium den. The only difference is their symbiotes must have kept the
     host's mind chemically balanced once they left.

     TEAL'C
     Then it is most likely I will be able to leave.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, how nice for you.

     CARTER
     Wait a minute. If you turned it off, how come I'm not getting
     depressed?

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps it will take some time to feel its effects.

     O'NEILL
     Let's take advantage of that time.

   [O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c walk through to the palace Gate
   room.]

     O'NEILL
     Loran.

     LORAN
     Jack.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Where did your parents actually go?

     LORAN
     Far, far away from here.

     O'NEILL
     How far? Which direction? Kid's hiding something. Teal'c, Carter,
     with me.

   EXT--A BEACH WITH STATUES LINED UP ALONG IT

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     I guess the reality that we may never go home is setting in.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, Hammond'll keep us supplied with everything we'll need until we
     can figure this out. It's a nice beach.

     CARTER
     It'd be a good excuse for you, wouldn't it?

     O'NEILL
     Huh?

     CARTER
     To do nothing for a while.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     CARTER
     Forget it.

     O'NEILL
     That would be, "Forget it, Sir."

     CARTER
     Oh, please--you think I'm keeping that up if we're stuck here
     forever?

     O'NEILL
     Listen, Major...

     CARTER
     No way.

     O'NEILL
     That's "No way, Colonel."

     CARTER
     I'm supposed to accept that. That's the way it's going to be?

     O'NEILL
     That's the way it is.

     CARTER
     What difference does it make? It's not up to you.

     O'NEILL
     Carter! You're in withdrawal.

     CARTER
     Oh, I'm in withdrawal?!

     O'NEILL
     Yes! So am I.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill. Major Carter. I believe I have located the parents of
     Loran.

   [Teal'c shows Carter and O'Neill two half-buried skeletons.]

   INT--PALACE, GATE ROOM

   [Daniel is seated on the platform reading an instruction manual. Loran
   shows him a photo of his parents on the back of a camera.]

     LORAN
     That's my mother and father there. That's me.

     DANIEL
     You were a lot younger there.

     LORAN
     Yeah, it's old.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, about that...

     LORAN
     Hey, can I take an image of you?

     DANIEL
     Sure.

   [Loran takes Daniel's photo.]

     LORAN
     That's great. I'm sorry that you can't leave.

     DANIEL
     Are you? I mean it makes sense that you'd want some company. I'm
     just thinking maybe that's the reason you didn't tell us how
     dangerous the light was.

     LORAN
     No.

     DANIEL
     It's okay, I'm not mad.

     LORAN
     That's not why.

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c enter.]

     DANIEL
     What's wrong?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, we're going through that withdrawal thing again.

     DANIEL
     I felt fine the whole time you were gone.

     CARTER
     Actually, Sir, I'm starting to feel myself again.

     O'NEILL
     Me too. What's going on?

     CARTER
     Well, something other than that light must be affecting us.

     TEAL'C
     And we must stay in close proximity.

     DANIEL
     So not only are we stuck here--we're stuck here.

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [Daniel, O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Loran are standing next to the
   pedestal.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, it's sure not as much fun to look at with the light off.

     TEAL'C
     I feel no compulsion to remain here.

     CARTER
     Sir, I think you're maybe onto something.

     O'NEILL
     How's that?

     CARTER
     The light isn't what's affecting our minds--it's just something to
     take advantage of our altered state of our brain chemistry.

     DANIEL
     So...entertainment?

     CARTER
     Probably more than that. The colour and light interaction with our
     optic nerve probably triggers the chemical responses, but it's not
     the direct cause of the imbalance.

     O'NEILL
     What is the cause, then?

     CARTER
     There must be a hidden device emitting some form of energy or
     radiation that we can't detect with our instruments.

     O'NEILL
     All right, Loran. Why doesn't this room seem to affect you?

     LORAN
     Too young.

     O'NEILL
     How do you know that?

     LORAN
     My father told me.

     CARTER
     It is possible that this place can only affect an adult physiology.

     O'NEILL
     Fraiser says he's just as addicted as we are.

     LORAN
     She's right. The light didn't have any affect on me.

     O'NEILL
     Then what'd it do to your parents? We need to know what this thing
     does.

     LORAN
     When they get back, they'll explain.

     O'NEILL
     They're not coming back! You know that.

     LORAN
     They are.

     O'NEILL
     Someone buried those bodies! Now how do you shut that thing off?!

   [Loran activates the pedestal and the base lowers to expose a power
   core.]

     O'NEILL
     Figure that thing out.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

   INT--PALACE, LORAN'S ROOM

   [Loran is sitting looking at his picture of his parents. O'Neill enters
   and sits next to Loran.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey. I'm sorry. Nice picture. Your parents?

     LORAN
     I killed them.

     O'NEILL
     You did? I find that...What happened?

     LORAN
     We found this place. All that they would do is stare at that light.
     All day. The light didn't affect me--my father said it was because I
     was too young. But they didn't let me in the Light room anyway. I
     told them to stop every day. But they'd just tell me to bring them
     things.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. So you did that. And?

     LORAN
     One day I stopped. It was days before their hunger was stronger than
     the light. Then they came out, looking for me, looking for food, and
     I snuck into the light room...and I turned it off. Not just the
     light, everything. I didn't know that it would hurt them. I just
     wanted to go home.

     O'NEILL
     It's not your fault.

     LORAN
     They died because of me. They were screaming. They ran outside. They
     didn't make any sense. So I did, I turned it back on. But they were
     already in the water, so far...and they just kept on going, they
     just kept going and screaming and I'd turned it back on, but they
     just kept on going. And then they were gone. Next day I found them
     on the shore.

     O'NEILL
     Loran. You were trying to help them. You were trying to free them
     from something. It wasn't your fault.

     LORAN
     I miss them.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   INT--PALACE, THE LIGHT ROOM

   [Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are messing in the pedestal base.]

     O'NEILL
     What have you got?

     DANIEL
     We think we can turn it off.

     LORAN
     Don't let them. You'll die like my parents.

     CARTER
     If we shut if off cold turkey, Loran is right, we'll go into
     withdrawal again. But Teal'c and Daniel have translated some of the
     writing inside this thing, Sir, and we think it was designed to be
     turned down incrementally.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld who used this place needed human slaves in order to tend
     to their needs while they were here.

     CARTER
     We've already taken it down a notch without any harm.

     TEAL'C
     Within two or three weeks your brain chemistry will return to
     normal. You may then return home.

     O'NEILL
     So three weeks in a palace by the beach? Teal'c, you don't have to
     hang around. Why don't you head back and let Hammond know what's
     going on?

     TEAL'C
     Very well.

     LORAN
     And then you'll leave?

     O'NEILL
     I think we all will. Right?

     CARTER
     Yeah. He should return to normal along with the rest of us.

     LORAN
     Then I can go with you?

     O'NEILL
     Sure. Come on. Let's go see Teal'c off. You like ice cream?

     LORAN
     What's ice cream?
