   FADE IN

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET--P5S-381

   [We see a village tent settlement as the camera pans across the area.
   Children play in the foreground as the camera pans onto SG-1. They are
   sitting at a long table pilled with food and surrounded by the
   villagers. The village leader starts to talk to the gathered
   villagers.]

     HEDRAZAR
     Hundreds of villages like this one have cause to celebrate the
     transportation of our people to this great new land. We are
     especially honoured today by the presence of those responsible for
     finding this planet for us and saving us from certain doom. How can
     we ever repay them?

   [The leader takes O'Neill's hand and we see that she is blind. Carter
   and the others smile at her statement.]

     ELIAM

     (joking)
     By not boring then with long speeches, Hedrazar.

   [The villagers laugh.]

     HEDRAZAR

     (smiling)
     I meant what I said. You are all heroes to my people.

     O'NEILL
     It was our pleasure.

   [Hedrazar takes Eliam's hand. He is her son and is sitting next to his
   pregnant wife.]

     HEDRAZAR
     When my grandchild arrives, it will be the first Enkaran to be born
     in our new homeland. We will name the child after you, Colonel.

   [O'Neill looks up embarrassed from pouring a drink. Carter, Daniel and
   Teal'c smile.]

     NIKKA
     Eliam, it seems to be getting cold.

   [Eliam takes a coat and wraps it around Nikka.]

     ELIAM
     It seems to be getting colder each day since you visited.

     CARTER
     Yes, our atmospheric monitoring equipment is indicating that. We
     only had a short time to asses the planet's conditions but it
     appears that you may be in for a more severe winter than we first
     predicted.

     HEDRAZAR
     We are a hearty people and we will survive.

     CARTER
     The naquada reactor that we brought you should provide enough energy
     to keep your new city for a year.

     DANIEL
     Well, you've certainly accomplished a lot already.

   [Daniel nods towards the building development nearby.]

     HEDRAZAR
     And it has only been but one cycle of the moon! Come back in a year
     and you will find this planet transformed.

   [Suddenly a man runs up to the gathering.]

     CALEB
     Help! Help me please.

     HEDRAZAR
     What is it?

   [They all stand to help the running man.]

     ELIAM
     It is Caleb. He comes from the west.

   [Some of the villagers catch Caleb as he falls to the ground and help
   him up.]

     CALEB

     (panicked)
     It's so big! It destroyed out whole village! You must all flee!

   [They all look shocked. Caleb is breathing heavily obviously panicked
   and shocked.]

     ELIAM
     What are you talking about? Caleb, catch your breath!

     CALEB
     It comes this way!

     O'NEILL
     What does?

     CALEB

     (to SG-1)
     You must see it.

   EXT--P5S-381 STARGATE SITE

   [Caleb, Eliam and SG-1 run to near the Stargate then stop, shocked.]

     CALEB

     (pointing)
     There!

     O'NEILL

     (shocked)
     Whoa!

   [We see what is so shocking. It is an alien spaceship, massive in size.
   It is emitting what appears to be a `wall of fire' onto the planet
   destroying what is there already. Carter observes it via binoculars.]

     ELIAM
     What is it?

   [We see the spaceship close up destroying whatever is in its path.]

   END OF TEASER

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [We see a representation of the spaceship on the main computer display
   on the wall. Hammond, Carter, Daniel and O'Neill are sitting around the
   table studying it along with reports and photographs.]

     CARTER

     (to Hammond)
     We estimate the ship to be about two miles in diameter. The curtain
     of energy it's using to sweep the landscape stretches for over
     twenty miles. It seems to be depositing a yet unknown gas like
     substance that is spreading like a wake behind the ship. Now it
     extends beyond the range of the UAV but it appears to cover hundreds
     of miles.

     DANIEL
     Teal'c said he hadn't seen the technology before.

     CARTER
     We're still waiting for the analysis of the atmospheric samples
     taken by the UAV but you can see the damage being done.

   [Hammond studies some photographs of the damage and the ship.]

     DANIEL
     There don't appear to be any recognisable or discernible markings on
     the ship. If there's any good news it would appear that whoever's in
     control doesn't have any specific intention of attacking the
     Enkarrans.

     HAMMOND
     Why do you say that?

     DANIEL
     It just seems there would be a more direct approach.

     O'NEILL
     What difference does it make?

     CARTER

     (to Hammond)
     Sir, the Colonel's right. Based on the ships current speed I
     estimate it will take approximately 26 hours to reach Hedrazar's
     village.

     O'NEILL
     But it'll take out the Stargate first.

     HAMMOND
     Can we evacuate the Enkarrans in time?

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c's prepping them right now.

     CARTER
     The concern is where to send them. Even low level radiation can
     cause the Enkarrans to go blind. Without the density of ozone on
     this particular planet they'll all die.

     DANIEL
     The only other planet we know with similar conditions is the Enkaran
     home world and according to Enkaran verbal history there's no
     Stargate there.

     HAMMOND
     Right, the Goa'uld kidnapped their ancestors with ships.

     CARTER
     Even if we had a method of transportation the Enkarans of today
     would have no concept of where that planet is in the galaxy.

     HAMMOND
     I've put SG5, 6 and 9 out looking for another suitable planet.

     CARTER
     It's doubtful they'll find one in time sir.

     HAMMOND
     How long can we keep the Enkarans on Earth here in the mean time?

     CARTER
     A matter of days. Their condition would degrade the longer they were
     here.

     DANIEL
     There are thousands of them outside of Hedrazar's village spread a
     fair distance from the gate. It took us two weeks to transplant them
     to P5S-381 in the first place.

   [O'Neill looks directly at Hammond]

     O'NEILL
     The point is, General, we could never save them all.

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [We see a number of samples the UAV picked up next to the microscope.
   Carter is examining them as O'Neill and Daniel walk in.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, what have you got?

     CARTER
     Then analysis of the atmosphere in the wake of the ship shows a high
     incidence of Sulphur Dioxide.

   [O'Neill looks shocked.]

     O'NEILL
     Chemical warfare?

   [Daniel raises his eyebrows at this statement.]

     CARTER
     I don't think so sir. Take a look at this.

   [Carter moves away from the microscope and O'Neill peers down the
   viewer. We see orange spheres on the microscope.]

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Oh yeah! Little fuzzy orange things!

   [He looks at Carter.]

     CARTER
     They're microbes sir.

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

     CARTER
     The alien ship is depositing them on the planet's surface.

   [O'Neill moves so Daniel can take a look at the microbes. Daniel looks
   with his glasses on then takes them off to look again.]

     CARTER
     Now as near as I can tell they bond with Sulphur leeched out of the
     soil and when they decay they release Sulphur Dioxide.

     DANIEL
     So the big mean alien ship is trying to stink up the planet?

     CARTER
     It's a little bit more than that Sir. The microbes are only
     deposited after all of the native organisms have been destroyed. I
     think they're meant to replace them. Now if my theory is correct
     we're looking at the first building blocks of an alien ecosystem.

   [Daniel stands up from looking down the microscope realising what
   Carter is getting at.]

     DANIEL
     It's a terraformer.

     CARTER
     It's changing the environment to support an entirely different kind
     of life. An organic system based on Sulphur instead of carbon.

     DANIEL
     So is the ship is allowed to continue the process the whole planet
     will be remade?

     CARTER
     Look, all I know for sure is that the atmosphere on the other side
     of that energy curtain will not support life!

   [We then see a shot of gate travel.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET--P5S-381

   [Daniel and O'Neill have travelled back to Hedrazar's village. They are
   met by Teal'c. There does not appear to have been any preparations made
   to evacuate the area.]

     O'NEILL
     What's going on?

     TEAL'C
     They do not wish to leave, O'Neill.

   [O'Neill looks at Teal'c annoyed and they all walk over to the main
   tent in the village.]

   INT--MAIN VILLAGE TENT

   [We see O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c walk in and over to where Hedrazar,
   Eliam and other village elders are standing.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c say's that you don't want to go?

     ELIAM
     If we go with you to Earth and you cannot find another world on
     which we could live, we will die there.

     O'NEILL
     Give us a chance.

     HEDRAZAR
     Would there be time to take every Enkaran?

     O'NEILL
     No.

     HEDRAZAR
     We cannot leave our people behind.

     O'NEILL
     Look, I understand how you feel...

     ELIAM

     (interrupting)
     Generations ago our ancestors were kidnapped from our home world and
     taken away in giant ships. Since then we have all prayed for a place
     that we can call home. Thanks to you we have found it.

     HEDRAZAR
     We must stay here and fight for it.

     O'NEILL
     With what?

     ELIAM
     Have you not weapons to aid us?

   [O'Neill looks at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     We're going to try to communicate with whatever's on that ship
     first.

     ELIAM
     Clearly they intend to destroy us

     O'NEILL
     We don't know anything for sure.

     HEDRAZAR
     I know that if the Enkaran people are to die then we shall all die
     here, together!

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET--P5S-381 GATE

   [Carter is setting up some scientific transmitting equipment near to
   the gate. The alien spacecraft is in the background slowly advancing.
   O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c approach from the village.]

     CARTER
     The transmitter's now operational sir. Let's hope we get a bite.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Do you think a well placed stinger would do some damage?

   [Carter looks back on the ship.]

     CARTER
     Well we have no way of knowing what material the ship's made of,
     sir.

     TEAL'C
     Or if it possesses shield technology.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, just fantasising

     DANIEL
     Any intelligence capable of engineering something like that has to
     be capable of reason.

     CARTER
     Question is; will they listen?

     O'NEILL
     Well the real question is; will they have ears?

   [Suddenly SG-1 are enveloped in orange shafts of light and they are
   `beamed away'.]

   INT--SPACESHIP

   [SG-1 materialise inside a room on the spaceship. Everything is pure
   white in appearance. There are tubes along the walls filled with water
   with bubbles of air travelling up them. SG-1 are immediately wary.
   Carter and O'Neill hold their weapons and look around cautiously.]

     DANIEL
     Somebody heard something!

     TEAL'C
     It appears to be a storage facility of some kind.

     O'NEILL
     I'm going to assume that we're onboard that ship.

   [O'Neill looks at the `bubble tubes'. They go high up to the ceiling.]

     CARTER
     You know, it's strange. The aliens went to so much trouble to change
     the atmosphere on the planet. Yet the air in here is perfectly
     breathable.

     DANIEL
     They were expecting us!

   [Carter touches the walls exploring them. They appear to be sectioned
   off into compartments.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter.

     CARTER
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     Should we really be opening draws and things?

   [As O'Neill is saying this Daniel lightly touches one of the
   compartments and it springs out to reveal a drawer full of circular
   containers. Daniel jumps back slightly.]

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     What did I just say?

   [Daniel looks embarrassed.]

     DANIEL
     Sorry!

   [O'Neill and Carter walk over to the compartment. Daniel touches
   another of the segments and another draw comes out of the wall full of
   containers. Carter takes one of the containers out and studies it.]

     CARTER
     It looks like some kind of tissue sample.

     O'NEILL
     Of what?

     CARTER
     I'm not sure.

   [Daniel takes one of the containers and studies it also.]

     DANIEL
     The ship's terraforming the planet right? What if these are the new
     life forms it's creating the planet for?

     CARTER
     Recreating an entire civilisation!

     DANIEL

     (thoughtfully)
     Millions of samples.

     O'NEILL
     So, every one of these things is a...what?

     DANIEL
     Plant, animal, insect.

     O'NEILL
     Alien?

     DANIEL
     Who knows?

     CARTER
     It's still just a guess.

   [A hissing sound of a door opening is hears and a man's voice is
   heard.]

     LOTAN
     A good one.

   [They all spin round. Carter and O'Neill have their weapons drawn. We
   see a man in white robes and the appearance of an Enkaran step through
   a doorway.]

     LOTAN
     I am Lotan. You need not fear me.

     O'NEILL

     (unconvinced)
     Yeah...listen, what's going on around here?

     LOTAN
     I have been assembled in order to more easily facilitate
     communication between this ship as you call it and yourselves.

   [Daniel and O'Neill exchange worried glances.]

     O'NEILL
     Assembled you say?

     LOTAN
     I am a biomechanical representation of the beings now occupying this
     planet. When they were first encountered several Enkarans were
     scanned by the ship and a randomised but similar appearance was
     selected.

     CARTER
     Wait a second, that was yesterday! This ship analysed a new life
     form and created a new replica in one day?

     LOTAN
     Yes.

   [Lotan holds out his hands and studies them.]

     LOTAN
     Fascinating as I am.

     DANIEL
     I suppose that explains why you look like an Enkaran.

     O'NEILL
     Sort of!

   [Lotan stares at Carter with a puzzled expression. Carter immediately
   raises her gun again.]

     LOTAN
     You are not!

     DANIEL
     Err no...we're from a planet called Earth. This is Major Samantha
     Carter, I'm Daniel Jackson. This is Jack O'Neill and this is Teal'c.

   [Daniel points to everyone as he introduces them. Lotan looks at Teal'c
   who bows his head.]

     O'NEILL
     Actually we're friends of the people your ship seems bent on wiping
     out.

     LOTAN
     Yes, that is unfortunate. I was created to deliver a message to
     them. However by the time I was completed the Enkarans in the
     immediate vicinity seemed to have disappeared.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, see, that's called running away. What one does to avoid being
     slaughtered!

   [Lotan looks at O'Neill confused.]

     DANIEL
     There are still quite a few Enkarans living on the planet.

     LOTAN
     Since you are friends with the Enkarans would you deliver the
     message to them?

     O'NEILL
     That would depend.

     LOTAN
     When the transformation process was first begun there were no
     sentient life forms present.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well there are now.

     LOTAN
     Yes. Unfortunately for your friends once the process has begun it
     must be completed.

   [Daniel looks worriedly at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Are you saying someone went to the trouble of making you just to
     come here to tell those folks, tough luck, get out?

     LOTAN
     We wish no harm to come to the Enkarans. However upon examination of
     their physiology it had been determined that they will not be able
     to exist in the planets transformed environment.

     O'NEILL
     So stop transforming it!

     DANIEL

     (to O'Neill)
     Jack, they're just trying to get the point across the best way
     possible.

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     I know what the point is. It's the PR guy.
     (to Lotan)
     I think we should be talking to your boss.

     LOTAN
     Assumption of hierarchical command structure! Interesting, follow
     me.

   [Carter looks back at O'Neill who nods. Daniel replaces the sample that
   he has been examining, closes the drawer and they follow Lotan. We see
   SG-1 follow Lotan into another chamber. Lotan stops by a console and
   activates it. In the centre of the chamber we see that an image of an
   alien being is projected. SG-1 all stare at it.]

     LOTAN
     The ship is fully automated. The beings that built it are called the
     Gadmere.

   [SG-1 look at the Gadmere appearance. It is a completely alien form.]

     O'NEILL
     Not exactly ET!

     LOTAN
     They have placed all of their knowledge within the ships memory.
     Science, mathematics, medicine, art, philosophy. Ten thousand years
     of civilisation. This is their legacy, they were a very advanced
     race compared to the Enkarans. However they were also peaceful and
     fell victim to a superior military power. So they built this ship in
     the hopes that their world would be born again far from the reach of
     their enemies.

   [Daniel walks over to the image.]

     DANIEL
     This is fascinating. I'd love a chance to study some of it.

     LOTAN
     I could provide you with translations. Your language is simple by
     comparison.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me, about why we're here?

     LOTAN
     The ship has only enough raw material to transform one planet. Now
     that the transformation has been started it must be finished here or
     the entire Gadmere civilisation will be lost forever. The Enkarans
     must leave of they will die.

     O'NEILL
     Alright, now see, right there we've got a problem!

     TEAL'C
     The Enkarans cannot leave.

     CARTER
     Their lives depend on the very rare environmental conditions that
     are unique to this planet.

     LOTAN
     That is unfortunate.

   [O'Neill looks at Lotan amazed.]

     O'NEILL
     That's it!

     LOTAN
     Please explain the situation to the Enkarans.

     CARTER
     But...

   [SG-1 are enveloped in the orange light again and are beamed off the
   ship.]

   EXT--HEDRAZAR'S VILLAGE

   [We see Eliam talking to Hedrazar and other villagers. He looks round
   and sees SG-1 approaching.]

     ELIAM
     They're back!

   [He runs over to SG-1.]

     ELIAM
     Well...did you speak with the Aliens?

     O'NEILL
     In a way.

   [Hedrazar sees the looks on SG-1's faces.]

     HEDRAZAR
     It did not go well?

     O'NEILL
     No. It didn't.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY

   INT--CONTROL ROOM STAIRS

   [Carter and Hammond are walking up the stairs in the control room to
   the briefing room. Carter is explaining the situation.]

     CARTER
     The tests on the alien microbes show that they are also vulnerable
     to UV radiation. That's probably why they chose this planet.

     HAMMOND
     The dense ozone layer.

     CARTER
     Among other things I'm sure. The same conditions that make P5S-381
     ideal for the Enkarans make it ideal for the transformation.

   [They step up into the briefing room where Daniel and O'Neill are
   sitting at the table. Carter and Hammond sit at the table.]

     HAMMOND
     Can this information be used to stop the alien ship?

     CARTER
     I'm not sure how sir.

     DANIEL
     That's assuming we have a right to stop them at all.

   [O'Neill looks surprised at Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     DANIEL
     I don't mean to sound insensitive to the Enkarans but we'd be
     interfering with the rebirth of an entire alien civilisation. Now if
     you believe Lotan, an incredibly advanced and peaceful one.

     O'NEILL
     So the best society wins here?

     DANIEL
     No I wasn't saying that.

     O'NEILL
     You're talking about a bunch of freeze dried aliens whose
     civilisation was lost a long time ago. The Enkarans are there now!

     DANIEL
     I don't want to see anything happen to them either.

     HAMMOND
     What about this robot? Could he be convinced to delay the
     transformation long enough for us to relocate the Enkarans.

     O'NEILL
     The robot's a robot sir.

     CARTER
     He's basically just a messenger sir.

     DANIEL
     But he was created in the image of the Enkarans so that they could
     relate to him, understand his explanation of what was happening to
     them and why. Now that could work to our advantage!

     O'NEILL

     (unconvinced)
     How?

     DANIEL
     Well, it might make him more sympathetic to their plight.

     O'NEILL
     It's a robot!

   [Daniel and O'Neill stare at each other with growing tension.]

     DANIEL
     He is an incredibly advanced alien creation. We shouldn't just
     assume that he's incapable of reason or feelings.

     CARTER
     Well he didn't seem very concerned with helping.

     DANIEL
     Well if he's capable of learning we might be able to get him to
     think outside his program.

     O'NEILL
     What if he isn't and we can't?

     HAMMOND
     What do you propose Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     I say we throw everything we've got at that ship!

     HAMMOND
     I'm sorry. I can't authorise a military strike in this situation,
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Look General. I apologise if all this seems to have taken on a
     personal edge for me. But we spent months getting to know these
     people. They trusted us and we screwed up.

     HAMMOND
     I understand your feeling. We've all invested a lot into this
     operation. No one wants to see it end badly for the Enkarans.

   [O'Neill looks down realising the situation.]

     O'NEILL
     But you're not going to give me any effective weapons or personnel?

     HAMMOND
     Find another way out of this.

   [Hammond looks at the others.]

     HAMMOND
     Dismissed

   [He gets up and walks away. O'Neill and Daniel look at each other,
   annoyed.]

   EXT--HEDRAZAR'S PLANET

   [Carter, Daniel and O'Neill walk back into the village. They walk up to
   where Teal'c, Eliam and Hedrazar are waiting. Eliam points at the alien
   ship in the distance.]

     ELIAM
     The alien ship draws closer.

   [We see the ship is not far from the village.]

     O'NEILL
     Hedrazar, you can still save the people of your village.

     HEDRAZAR
     Our resolve has not changed. We will not abandon the rest of our
     people.

     TEAL'C
     Did General Hammond not authorise you to bring additional troops and
     weapons.

   [O'Neill looks at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     No he didn't.

     ELIAM
     You brought us to this planet! We trusted you when you told us it
     was safe!

     O'NEILL
     I know.

     ELIAM
     You gave us technology to build our cities, to provide heat. Have
     you not any way to stop the ship?

   [O'Neill pauses and turns back to Carter and Daniel. They look at
   O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     How much naquada is in that reactor we gave them?

   [Daniel and Carter look shocked.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

     DANIEL
     What are you doing?

     O'NEILL
     Thinking Daniel. Don't worry about it too much.

     DANIEL
     Thinking of a way to blow up this ship. I'm not really sure that's
     what General Hammond had in mind!

   [O'Neill looks at Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     They're going to stand there and die. It's a no won situation but
     we're not going to stand around here and watch these people getting
     slaughtered.

     DANIEL
     And you're willing to blow up that ship to...

   [O'Neill interrupts him.]

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     Give me another choice!

     DANIEL
     Well I don't have one at the moment!

     O'NEILL
     Apparently time is a factor here!

   [Daniel says nothing in response. O'Neill looks at Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     How do you make a naquada bomb?

     CARTER
     Well sir, the reactor was designed specifically to prevent exactly
     that kind of...

     O'NEILL
     Carter!

   [Carter thinks for a moment, obviously not happy with the situation.]

     CARTER
     Theoretically if I created a feedback loop, the energy would build
     up instead of being released. There would be a big explosion sir.

     O'NEILL
     Big enough?

     CARTER
     I think so.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, I'm making a choice to help these people. But if you don't
     make that bomb I'm out of options.

     CARTER
     (quietly)

   I know.

     O'NEILL
     So I have to order you to do it.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [She walks away to make the bomb. O'Neill looks at Daniel who obviously
   doesn't agree with the situation.]

   EXT--PLANET

   [Carter is preparing the reactor. O'Neill is looking at the ship as it
   is slowly approaching. They are positioned near to a lake away from the
   village.]

     O'NEILL
     How controlled is this going to be?

     CARTER
     The focus of the blast will be aimed upwards. This ridge should
     protect the village but this is as close as I would put it. I've
     modified this remote to start the feedback loop. About a minute
     after you press this button the reactor should reach critical
     overload and blow.

     O'NEILL
     Ship's ETA?

     CARTER
     About five zero minutes sir. But we should detonate before the
     ship's directly overhead. There's no telling what that beam will do
     to the reactor.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

     CARTER
     There's one more thing sir.

   [Carter stands to look at O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     Once you detonate the reactor there's no turning back. The overload
     can't be stopped.

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Alright.

   [They walk to the edge of the water and get into the small speedboat
   there. They start it and head across the water to the village.]

   EXT--HEDRAZAR'S VILLAGE

   [Daniel and Teal'c are watching the approaching ship from the village.
   Teal'c is using binoculars to see the ship. Daniel suddenly turns and
   walks away.]

     TEAL'C

     (turning to Daniel)
     Daniel Jackson...do you not plan on staying?

   [Daniel turns to face Teal'c. He looks annoyed and has his hands in his
   pockets.]

     DANIEL
     Err...no actually I was going to try and talk to Lotan.

   [Daniel turns again to walk away but Teal'c speaks again making him
   stop.]

     TEAL'C
     If you warn Lotan of our plan it will prove ineffective.

     DANIEL
     I'm not going to give anything away. I just wanna try to prevent it
     from being necessary.

     TEAL'C
     Should you not remain until the return of Colonel O'Neill and Major
     Carter?

     DANIEL
     Well actually Jack asked me to give him another choice
     so...technically I'm following an order.

   [Daniel this time walks away leaving Teal'c looking after him.]

   EXT--ALIEN SHIP FROM ABOVE

   [We see an aerial view of the ship from high above. Then camera then
   suddenly zooms down to the ship and we see...]

   INT--SHIP

   [Daniel is beamed into a corridor of the ship. He walks down it and
   sees Lotan standing in a beam of energy with his arms raised above him.
   As Daniel gets closer the beam stops and Lotan looks at Daniel.]

     LOTAN
     Hello, Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     Hi.

   [Daniel takes his glasses off and removes the sunglasses attachment. He
   then replaces his glasses and stares at Lotan uncertainly.]

     LOTAN
     Are the Enkarans going to leave the planet?

     DANIEL
     Actually the Enkarans have no where else to go.

     LOTAN
     That is tough luck. While you were gone I took the opportunity to
     breathe some of the sulphur-based environment being created by the
     ship.

     DANIEL
     How is it?

     LOTAN
     Not good.

   [Daniel looks around puzzled. Lotan activates a console and a form of
   music is heard. It is horrible to listen to and sounds like a jumble of
   different music forms.]

     LOTAN
     This music has not been heard in over a thousand years.

   [Daniel has his hand over his left ear. He looks as though the music is
   painful to listen to.]

     DANIEL

     (unconvincingly)
     It's nice.

     LOTAN
     It sounds very unpleasant to me.

     DANIEL
     Really!?

     LOTAN
     Yes...this is not how it should sound.

   [He turns the music off. Daniel looks relieved but doesn't say
   anything.]

     DANIEL
     How so?

     LOTAN
     It seems as though the design of your ears...my ears...is not meant
     for it.

     DANIEL
     Err...to be honest with you I'm here to see if you will consider
     alternate solutions to the problem faced by the Enkarans.

   [Lotan looks at Daniel puzzled.]

     LOTAN
     I am not programmed to solve the problem faced by the Enkarans.

     DANIEL
     Right...let me ask you something. What will happen to you when this
     is all over?

     LOTAN
     I will be reintegrated into the ships systems.

     DANIEL
     You mean you'll die?

     LOTAN
     Yes I suppose that is one interpretation.

     DANIEL
     Do you want to die?

     LOTAN
     What I want is irrelevant.

     DANIEL
     Wouldn't you like to...experience a little more of what it's like to
     be an Enkaran before you're reintegrated? I mean, see some of the
     planet before it's completely transformed and maybe even meet the
     people?

     LOTAN

     (puzzled)
     For what purpose?

     DANIEL
     Because it might help you consider alternate solutions.

     LOTAN
     I'm not programmed to consider alternate solutions.

     DANIEL
     You said the ship will continue to process without you, correct?

     LOTAN
     Yes, as I have said. Its functions are fully automated.

     DANIEL
     Well then no harm done. We'll just...we'll have a look around.

   EXT--LAKE

   [Carter and O'Neill pull up by the water edge in the boat. They are
   near the village. They start walking to the village.]

     CARTER
     Sir, no disrespect intended but I'm having doubts as to whether or
     not we're doing the right thing.

     O'NEILL
     What is that Carter? The right thing? We brought these people here.
     They depend on us. What else are they going to do?

     CARTER

     (frustrated)
     I don't know.

   [She stops walking and O'Neill turns to her.]

     O'NEILL
     You wanna talk me out of this?

     CARTER
     Yes sir!

   [She holds the trigger up towards him and he takes it slowly thinking
   about the situation.]

     O'NEILL
     Stay in contact.

   [He walks off to the village leaving Carter by the lake and the boat.]

   EXT--PLANET

   [Daniel and Lotan are walking along in the area surrounding the
   village. Daniel is showing Lotan the planet.]

     LOTAN
     The air is not as pure as that created for me on the ship.

     DANIEL
     It's definitely...different.

     LOTAN
     This is better.

     DANIEL
     I agree.

   [Lotan stops and looks at some trees.]

     LOTAN
     These are trees.

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     Yes err...anywhere there's oxygen you're sure to find trees. They're
     kinda like natures air filters.

     LOTAN
     Their design is most interesting.

   [He touches the leaves on a tree.]

     DANIEL
     So is their function.

   [Lotan smiles at Daniel.]

   EXT--HEDRAZAR'S VILLAGE

   [We see O'Neill walk quickly up to Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson has gone to speak to Lotan.

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     Did you try to stop him?

     TEAL'C
     I do not disagree with his intentions.

     O'NEILL
     You do know we're going to try and blow up that ship?

     TEAL'C
     I am aware of that as is Daniel Jackson.

   [O'Neill activates his radio to speak with Daniel.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel...Daniel come in.

     DANIEL

     (via radio)
     I read you, Jack.

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     Tell me...tell me you're not on that ship!

   [We see Daniel walking along on the planet with Lotan. He activates his
   radio to reply to O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, I'm not on the ship.

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     What are you doing Daniel?

     DANIEL
     I'm talking to Lotan.

   [O'Neill turns to look at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     Is he going to tell him about the bomb?

     TEAL'C
     He said he would not reveal our plan.

   [We see Carter standing at the Stargate looking at her watch.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill via radio)
     Sir we only have about 15 minutes!

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel via radio)
     Daniel do you know what time it is?

   [Again we see Daniel and Lotan walking through a field near the
   village. Daniel talks quietly to O'Neill via the radio.]

     DANIEL
     I am trying to give you another choice.

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     What?

     DANIEL
     Err...hang on, we're on our way back to the village. Over and out.

   [O'Neill turns back to Teal'c with an angry exhale of breath.]

   EXT--VILLAGE SURROUNDING AREA

   [We see Daniel and Lotan still walking.]

     LOTAN
     You have disobeyed your superior.

     DANIEL
     Umm...no, not exactly.

     LOTAN
     You are not fulfilling your function Daniel Jackson.

   [We see Daniel rub his head.]

     DANIEL
     Well...you see that's not true. I'm choosing the best way to fulfil
     my true function. You see, sometimes hierarchical command structures
     don't allow you to consider all possible options.

   [Lotan stops and stares at Daniel.]

     LOTAN
     I see.

     DANIEL
     Let's err...let's go to the village.

   EXT--HEDRAZAR'S VILLAGE

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are standing looking at the approaching ship with
   binoculars. Suddenly Daniel and Lotan materialise nearby. O'Neill runs
   over to Daniel with his arms spread in question.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Lotan wanted to meet the Enkarans.

   [Two Enkarans have approached Lotan and he is staring back at them.
   Suddenly Carter's voice is heard via the radio.]

     CARTER

     (via radio)
     Ten minutes Sir!

   INT--MAIN VILLAGE TENT

   [We see Hedrazar, Eliam and the village elders sitting in the tent as
   Lotan and Daniel enter. Eliam walks over to them.]

     DANIEL
     Hello Eliam...This is Lotan.

   [Daniel points at Lotan who steps forward. Eliam looks at Lotan
   puzzled.]

     ELIAM
     He looks Enkaran. But I have not met him before.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter the tent. Daniel looks at them then turns
   back to Eliam.]

     DANIEL
     Lotan is a representative of the aliens who build the ship. He was
     created in your image in order to better communicate the ships
     mission and the danger you are in.

   [Nikka is explain what is happening to Hedrazar in the background.]

     ELIAM
     And yet he does not stop it.

     DANIEL
     No...Lotan this is Eliam.

   [Hedrazar gets up from her chair and walks over to Lotan, Daniel and
   Eliam with Nikka.]

     DANIEL
     This is his wife, Nikka, and this is Hedrazar, the leader of the
     village.

   [Hedrazar walks right up to Lotan and feels his face.]

     HEDRAZAR
     Are you now able to see the lives that will be extinguished if the
     ship continues its current path?

     DANIEL
     Yes, Lotan is aware of that.

   [Lotan stares at Hedrazar.]

     LOTAN
     She is without sight.

   [Hedrazar rejoins Eliam and Nikka.]

     DANIEL
     It's something that was happening to them on the planet where we
     first met. They were dying. This was the only planet we could find
     where we knew they could survive.

     LOTAN
     I am aware of their physiological needs.

     DANIEL
     Yes, of course.

   [Lotan looks over at Nikka who is heavily pregnant. Eliam puts a
   protective hand on her stomach.]

     LOTAN
     That one is going to give birth.

     DANIEL
     Yes to err...a new Enkaran life.

     ELIAM
     There will be no Enkaran life at all if your ship does not stop.

   [O'Neill interrupts.]

     O'NEILL
     I think we're all aware of the situation.

     LOTAN
     Yes, you have brought me here to elicit sympathy for these people.

     DANIEL
     Well actually...they're your people in a way Lotan. You were created
     in their image.

     LOTAN
     I was not created to prevent their demise Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     But...don't you wish you could?

     LOTAN
     The ship calls me back.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     LOTAN
     I must go.

     DANIEL
     Take me with you.

   [O'Neill steps forward anxiously.]

     O'NEILL
     No...Daniel, no!

   [We see the orange light reflect on O'Neill as Daniel and Lotan are
   beamed back to the ship.]

   EXT--STARGATE

   [We see Carter standing near the Stargate looking at her watch.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill via radio)
     Five minutes sir.

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Lotan just took Daniel back up to the ship.

   [Carter looks up surprised.]

     CARTER
     What...sir?

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     He asked to go!

     CARTER
     Well, what are we going to do sir, the ship is almost in position.

   [She looks at the ship through her binoculars]

   INT--ALIEN SHIP

   [We see Lotan and Daniel walk into the chamber where the holographic
   projector is. It shows the planet landscape and a blip where the bomb
   is.]

     LOTAN
     The ship has detected an unusual device. It appears to be capable of
     emitting great amounts of energy.

   [Lotan looks back at Daniel.]

     LOTAN
     Is this device intended to try and stop the ship as the Enkaran
     named Eliam suggested?

     DANIEL
     Look Lotan, I don't agree with what they're doing but I also don't
     want to see you wipe out those people!

     LOTAN
     If they will not leave there is no other option.

   EXT--STARGATE

   [Carter is looking at the ship through her binoculars.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill via radio)
     The ship is in position sir.

   [We see O'Neill and Teal'c in the village staring at the approaching
   ship. O'Neill is thinking about the situation. He clearly doesn't know
   what to do about Daniel being on the ship.]

     CARTER

     (at Stargate)
     If you're going to do it, do it now!

   [We see O'Neill look at Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson has made his choice O'Neill.

   [O'Neill still looks hesitant. He looks over at the villagers huddled
   together near the tents then holds up the overload trigger.]

     O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Yeah.

   [He presses the trigger and then stares at the ship.]

   EXT--NAQUADAH REACTOR

   [We see the reactor trigger go off and it starting to overload.]

   INT--SHIP

   [We see Lotan and Daniel staring at the readout.]

     LOTAN
     The device has entered an active state.

     DANIEL
     Lotan if you wanted to, can you stop the ship?

     LOTAN
     As I have said...

     DANEL

     (hurriedly)
     Yes I know what you said, it isn't about what you want. Just please
     answer the question. Can you stop the ship?

     LOTAN
     It would be possible, yes.

     DANIEL
     Ok, then think about this. Think about the people down there and all
     the life forms you would be destroying.

     LOTAN
     I am programmed to serve the life on this ship.

   [Daniel turns away quickly thinking. He suddenly looks up.]

     DANIEL
     You say that were an advanced civilisation, ten thousand years of
     history?

     LOTAN
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     They had laws, justice?

     LOTAN
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     A respect for life?

     LOTAN
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     Then how can that world be recreated through an act of mass murder?

   [Lotan turns his head thoughtfully at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Wouldn't that be a betrayal of everything they stood for? You said
     you were made to communicate. You're not here simply to serve life
     on this ship, you're here to protect the integrity of life on this
     ship! There's a big difference. Are you really fulfilling your true
     function by allowing this to happen?

   [Lotan stares at Daniel.]

   EXT--STARGATE

   [We see Carter looking at the ship.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill via radio)
     Sixty seconds to detonation.

   [Suddenly the ship stops and Carter looks at it.]

   EXT--VILLAGE

   [In the village we see Teal'c and O'Neill stare at the stopped ship]

     TEAL'C
     The ship has stopped O'Neill.

   [O'Neill looks surprised and the villagers look relieved for the
   moment.]

     CARTER

     (via radio)
     Daniel must have got through to them.

   [O'Neill gives a half smile. He activates his radio.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, if you can hear me you've got thirty seconds...three zero,
     over.

   INT--SHIP

   [We see Lotan and Daniel looking at the readout of the device.]

     DANIEL
     Err...about the device.

     LOTAN
     It is still active.

     DANIEL
     Yes, can you do anything about that?

   [Lotan presses some buttons on the console and the `bomb' is beamed
   into the chamber. Daniel looks at it aghast!]

     LOTAN
     Do you know how to deactivate it?

     DANIEL
     No!

   [Lotan stares at the reactor.]

     LOTAN
     Intriguing design.

     DANIEL
     Err...yeah Lotan we really don't have time for this.

     LOTAN
     How much time do we have?

   EXT--STARGATE

   [We see Carter staring at her watch.]

     CARTER
     Five, four, three, two, one!

   [We see O'Neill and Teal'c. O'Neill is not looking at the ship. Just
   then the bomb is shot out from the ship and explodes harmlessly away in
   the sky. We see Eliam and Nikka looking up at the exploding bomb.
   Hedrazar is panicking about the situation as she cannot see what is
   going on.]

     HEDRAZAR
     What is going on?

     ELIAM
     The ship remains!

   INT--SHIP

   [We see Daniel and Lotan looking at a display of the explosion.]

     LOTAN
     A powerful explosion.

     DANIEL
     We were desperate.

     LOTAN
     The conflict remains unresolved. I must eventually resume the
     transformation process on this planet or the Gadmere civilisation
     will be lost.

     DANIEL
     I know.

   [He walks over to Lotan who is working at a console.]

     LOTAN
     Many millions of planets were scanned, to match the right conditions
     for the transformation.

   [Daniel looks at him puzzled. We see the holographic projector showing
   images of the millions of planets.]

     LOTAN
     Only one met the specifications.

     DANIEL
     Just out of curiosity, were any others even close?

     LOTAN
     Two thousand, six hundred and thirty four parameters had to be
     exactly right for the...

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     For the transformation process, yes but what about for the Enkarans?

   [Lotan looks puzzled.]

     LOTAN
     I do not understand.

     DANIEL
     Well maybe the Enkarans don't need exactly the same environment as
     the transformation process, just a very similar one. Now you know
     their physiology better than anyone. Do any of the planets scanned
     by the ship match the needs of the Enkarans?

   [Lotan presses some buttons on the console and the image of one planet
   is displayed. He and Daniel look at it.]

     LOTAN
     Here. This planet would be appropriate for the Enkarans.

   [Daniel looks surprised at Lotan.]

     LOTAN
     I regret that I didn't consider this possibility Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     Well, you would have gotten there eventually.

     LOTAN
     This planet was rejected by the ship because three of the parameters
     were not correct. The core temperature was too warm, the size was
     too large and there were intelligent life forms already present.

     DANIEL
     Intelligent life forms?

   [Lotan turns to Daniel.]

     LOTAN
     Based on their description I believe they were Enkaran.

   INT--MAIN VILLAGE TENT

   [We see O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c walk into the tent to talk to
   Hedrazar.]

     HEDRAZAR
     So, what shall we do now?

   [Suddenly the tent is engulfed in the orange light and Lotan and Daniel
   materialise in the tent.]

     HEDRAZAR

     (concerned)
     What is it?

     DANIEL
     It's ok, don't err...don't be afraid.

   [O'Neill walks over to Daniel and Lotan.]

     O'NEILL
     What's going on?

     DANIEL

     (to the villagers)
     Lotan would like to offer you a compromise.

     LOTAN
     The ship has expended too many of the resources needed for the
     transformation process to begin on another planet.

   [Hedrazar and Eliam look confused.]

     LOTAN
     I require that you give up this world.

   [O'Neill rolls his eyes at these words.]

     ELIAM
     How is that a compromise?

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     We've found the original Enkaran home world.

   [The villagers all gasp. Hedrazar stands up and walks forward
   excitedly.]

     HEDRAZAR
     What?

     CARTER
     How?

     DANIEL
     It was one of several million scanned by the ship before it settled
     on this one and it was rejected partly on the presence of
     intelligent life forms.

     O'NEILL

     (unconvinced)
     He's telling us this now?

     DANIEL
     Well he didn't know and technically he's just a day and a half old
     so...give him a break.

     HEDRAZAR
     We will gladly accept this offer to return to the home of our
     ancestors.

   [Eliam and Nikka smile and nod at this.]

     CARTER
     How do we get them there?

     TEAL'C
     The Enkaran home world has no Stargate.

   [They all look at Daniel and Lotan.]

     DANIEL
     Well actually I have this friend with a big spaceship who's willing
     to take them.

     HEDRAZAR

     (amazed)
     Is this possible?

     LOTAN
     Yes, once you are safely to your home planet I will be reintegrated
     into the ships systems and the ship will be returned here to
     complete the transformation process.

     DANIEL
     Does that have to happen, the part about you having to be
     reintegrated?

     LOTAN
     What other option is there?

     HEDRAZAR
     But you are Enkaran. You must stay with us.

     LOTAN
     That is not contrary to my programming.

   [The Enkarans stare at Lotan puzzled.]

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     Lotan says thank you, he'd like that very much!

   [Hedrazar steps forward.]

     HEDRAZAR
     Spread the word among the villages. We are going home!

   [Lotan smiles at Daniel who in turn looks and smiles at O'Neill.
   O'Neill gives a half hearted smile back.]

   EXT--PLANET SHOT

   [We see SG-1 waving goodbye to Hedrazar, Eliam, Nikka and the last few
   villagers as they are beamed up into the ship. It then leaves the
   planet.]

   FADE OUT

   THE END
