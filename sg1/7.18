   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Klaxons blare. Bregman heads towards the Gate Room, then notices his
   film crew with Rundell. standing in a side corridor. He approaches them
   confused.]

     BREGMAN
     What's going on? I thought you guys were scheduled to get shots of
     the Gate?

     WICKENHOUSE
     We got bumped again.

     JAMES
     Something's up.

     BREGMAN
     What do you mean?

     RUNDELL
     Something big. You just missed SG-1 headed toward the Gate Room in
     full gear.

     BREGMAN
     What, you got it on tape?

   [The crew shake their heads.]

     JAMES
     No...

     RUNDELL
     It's unauthorized. It's ongoing--

     BREGMAN
     Ongoing activity. I know. But SG-1?

     JAMES
     Yes.

     BREGMAN
     Dr. Jackson said he wasn't due to go offworld for a couple of days.
     What's changed?

     RUNDELL
     I don't know, but it happens all the time.

     BREGMAN
     But you said it was something big?

     RUNDELL

     (coldly)
     Something big happens all the time.

   [Another SG-team in full combat gear moves quickly down the hall.
   Bregman starts to go with them.]

     BREGMAN

     (to camera crew)
     Something's happening right now. What's this? Follow me, let's go.
     Come on.

   [When he reaches the corridor junction he sees Fraiser and a medical
   team, also dressed in combat gear, hurrying to the Gate room.]

     BREGMAN
     Doctor Fraiser?

     FRAISER
     Sorry, I have to go.

     BREGMAN

     (to film crew)
     Come on.

   [Fraiser and the medical team hurry into the Gate Room. Bregman tries
   to follow but two SFs block his path.]

     RUNDELL
     You're not allowed, Mister Bregman, and you know that.

     BREGMAN
     I-I just...I...

   [Bregman heaves a frustrated sigh.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   CARTER'S DOCUMENTARY INTERVIEW

   [Carter is on video footage responding to Bregman's questions.]

     CARTER
     There are days when you feel the pressure. I'm trained to handle it.

     BREGMAN
     With all due respect, Major, how can anyone be trained to handle an
     alien encounter where the stakes are, if what I'm told is correct,
     the stakes could be the survival of the planet?

     CARTER
     I think it's important to remember that it's not just about this
     planet. Countless humans throughout the galaxy, people that
     originated right here on Earth, have been enslaved for thousands of
     years. I mean, we're taking the fight back to the Goa'uld on their
     behalf.

     BREGMAN
     So how do you think the American people are going to react, the
     world is going to react, when they discover that a war--an alien
     war--has been waged without their knowledge?

     CARTER

     (pauses, then hesitantly)
     I don't think that that's-that's for me to, um...Are you suggesting
     that we shouldn't be doing this?

     BREGMAN
     No, I'm not saying we shouldn't defend ourselves. I'm simply asking
     your opinion, Major.

     CARTER
     I-I don't think that that's for me to, um...uh...

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [A VIP room has been converted into a makeshift film editing studio. A
   variety of monitors, computers, and audio visual equipment is set up at
   one end of the room. James and Bregman sit side-by-side, studying
   Carter's interview footage.]

     BREGMAN
     No. Just stop it right there.

     CARTER

     (on video)
     I don't know...

   [James stops the playback.]

     BREGMAN
     You see, this is um, not her fault. I mean I backed her into a
     corner, and I do not want to make this whole thing look like it's
     antagonistic, so--

     JAMES
     Okay, so lose this?

     BREGMAN
     Well, I don't know. Just skip ahead to, uh, after the apology.

   [James presses a few keys. A different part of the interview is queued
   up.]

     BREGMAN
     There, that's it!

     BREGMAN

     (on video)
     Major, one day, the secret will all come out. How do you think the
     people of the world are going to react?

   [Bregman nods at the new footage.]

     BREGMAN
     Much better way of asking the question.

     CARTER

     (on video)
     I honestly don't know. I hope they can appreciate everything we've
     been through. What it all means for our continuing existence. In
     light of that, I hope that they will understand why the people in
     charge chose to keep it a secret as long as they have.

     BREGMAN

     (on video)
     Is it difficult to keep the secret?

   [Bregman expresses his satisfaction with the new footage, and James
   nods in agreement.]

     CARTER
     Yeah, of all the things I do around here, in many ways that is the
     hardest. Sometimes you-you look at what's going on here on Earth,
     and it-it makes you want to scream. You want to tell people it is
     all so much bigger than what they think.

   INT--SGC VIP ROOM

     BREGMAN

     And...stop it right there and go right to Doctor Jackson saying...
     (looking at his sheet)
     "Whether I was right." And you're going to put me into the Carter
     interview.

     JAMES
     Yes.

   [James queues up Daniel's interview.]

     BREGMAN
     The second half, especially the line: "Is it difficult to keep the
     secret?" Okay. Thank you. All right, move on.

   DANIEL'S DOCUMENTARY INTERVIEW

     DANIEL
     Whether I was right or not doesn't matter, especially given the
     scope of the truth.

     BREGMAN
     And the truth matters to you?

     DANIEL
     To everyone, I hope.

     BREGMAN
     Now, what truth, Doctor Jackson? The truth for the people here on
     Earth? Or are we talking about another planet?

     DANIEL
     We're talking about people here. People on other planets are no less
     human. People who have had their freedom usurped, people who are
     being forced to worship false gods to mask their enslavement.

     BREGMAN
     But what about the people here on Earth? Are they entitled to the
     truth, do you think?

     DANIEL

     (pointing to camera)
     Is that what this is about?

   INT--SGC VIP ROOM

     BREGMAN

     (on video)
     This? I'm not in control of when this airs. Do you think that this
     should get out? If it were up to you...

   [Bregman and James nod at the new footage.]

     BREGMAN
     The way they cut together.

   DANIEL'S DOCUMENTARY INTERVIEW

     DANIEL
     That's a complicated issue.

     BREGMAN
     No, I'm asking you, Doctor Jackson, do you think that people on
     Earth should know about this right now?

     DANIEL
     What do you think would happen?

     BREGMAN
     I think the people don't care much about what I think.

   INT--SGC VIP ROOM

     BREGMAN
     All right, cut that line. Nobody cares that nobody cares what I
     think. Lose it.

     JAMES

     (punching some keys)
     Okay, it's gone.

     BREGMAN
     Moving on.

     BREGMAN

     (on video)
     I haven't done what you've done, Doctor Jackson. I think people care
     what you think.

     DANIEL

     (on video)
     Well, I think it's a relative question, and it depends on your point
     of view.

     BREMAN

     (shaking his head in dismay)
     Oh, no. Wait. Stop it. This is-it's terrible.

     JAMES

     (smiling)
     Really? I think it's pretty interesting stuff. You know, you did a
     good job at getting them to express their true feelings.

     BREGMAN

     (talking over him)
     Yak yak yak yak. A bunch of talking heads is all it is.

     JAMES
     Personally, I could watch Major Carter's head talk all day.

     BREGMAN

     (still talking over him)
     We need pictures, we need images to tell this story. What these
     people are doing here, good or bad, makes the lunar landing look
     like we were testing our toes in the ocean. And what have we got to
     show for it? Yak yak yak, nothing! Where's the equivalent shot of
     Shepard playing golf on the moon? We don't have it. This is
     unbelievably boring!

   EXT--P3X-666, DAY

   [Al'kesh and death gliders fire missiles down to the ground as SG
   personnel exchange fire with enemy Jaffa. Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill
   move forward in an interspersed pattern. O'Neill finally takes cover
   next to Dixon.]

     DIXON
     Hi, Jack. Thanks for coming!

     O'NEILL
     I was told you said there was six Jaffa! Where'd you learn to count?

   [The exchange of fire continues. An al'kesh drops another load of
   bombs.]

     DIXON
     The ships didn't start coming down until you radioed you were
     through the Gate.

   [Teal'c spots a Jaffa approaching from one side. He hits it with a
   staff blast. O'Neill downs another Jaffa with armor piercing bullets.]

     DIXON
     Something tells me they're throwing this party in your honor, Jack.
     You got those clips?

   [O'Neill hands Dixon some clips of ammunition. O'Neill and Dixon reload
   their weapons.]

     AIRMAN

     (over radio)
     Colonel O'Neill, our position is being compromised! We're not gonna
     to be able to hold the Gate for long!

     O'NEILL

     (keying radio)
     It doesn't matter. We're not gonna be able to hold this position for
     that long!

     FRAISER

     (over radio)
     Colonel, I need more time to stabilize this patient. He can't be
     moved yet!

   [The exchange of heavy fire continues. Carter, behind cover at a rock
   close to O'Neill, turns to him.]

     CARTER
     Sir, we've gotta fall back!

   [An airman shoots a bazooka at a group of Jaffa behind some nearby
   rocks felling several of them. O'Neill is about to fire his weapon when
   he spots movement in his peripheral vision. A Jaffa is moving behind
   some heavy foliage, trying to outflank the SGC personnel. O'Neill
   glances quickly for oncoming fire, then moves to get into a better
   firing position to protect their flank. A staff weapon blast strikes
   O'Neill directly in the chest, and he falls backwards.]

     CARTER

     (spotting him fall)
     SIR!

   [Carter moves to assist him. Teal'c turns and is horrified by O'Neill's
   fall. O'Neill collapses onto the grass, unconscious, smoke curling from
   his chest.]

   [An al'kesh roars overhead, dropping more bombs into the area. The
   heavy weapons fire continues. Dixon spares a glance back at O'Neill
   between shots, his face grim. Carter runs to his side and checks his
   injury.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The documentary crew films Harriman as he takes them on a tour of the
   Gate Room. Bregman touches one of the mounted guns stationed there.]

     BREGMAN
     That's .50 caliber, right?

   [Harriman nods.]

     BREGMAN
     You get really shaken up if you don't know what you're doing.

     HARRIMAN
     Uh, no. Actually, our guys are trained to handle that kind of
     torque.

   [Harriman and Bregman walk towards the back of the room.]

     BREGMAN
     I'm just kidding. What is this? Get a shot of this!

   [Bregman points to some large computer equipment in the back of the
   room. The camera pans to it.]

     BREGMAN
     What is, uh...Can you explain how this operates?

     HARRIMAN
     Sure, our guys like to play a little "Space Invaders" when there's
     not much going on.

   [Harriman gives a small smile to the camera.]

     BREGMAN
     Ha ha ha. Very funny.

     HARRIMAN

     (nervous)
     No, obviously, I'm kidding.

     BREGMAN
     I know.

     HARRIMAN
     Certainly, it'd be completely inappropriate for any airman to play
     video games while on active duty.

     BREGMAN

     (irritated)
     Yeah, I got it, okay? Can we move on?

     HARRIMAN

     (smiling nervously)
     Sure.

     BREGMAN
     What's that on the wall?

   [He points to a device on the far wall. They walk over to it.]

     HARRIMAN
     Right over here is the uh, manual override for the iris.

     BREGMAN

     (suspicious)
     Are you kidding now? Is that a joke?

     HARRIMAN
     No, I'm serious.

     BREGMAN

     (touching the device)
     How does this...uh?

   [The chevrons on the Stargate start to engage.]

     HARRIMAN

     (yelling to control room)
     Incoming Wormhole!

   [Harriman races back to his station. Klaxons blare as a red light
   strobes over Bregman's head.]

     BREGMAN
     What does that mean?

     RUNDELL
     We're going to have to leave now.

   [Rundell blocks the camera and tries to herd the documentary crew out
   of the room. He makes a cutting motion across his neck to the camera.]

     BREGMAN
     No, no, no. Keep shooting!

     JAMES
     I can't do that!

   [James starts to put the camera down. Bregman pulls it out of his
   hands.]

     BREGMAN
     I can do it!

   [Bregman starts waving the camera around, trying to film.]

     HAMMOND

     (from control room)
     Remove that camera crew! Now!

   [Armed guards surround the documentary crew and force them through the
   doors. Backing away, Bregman makes of show of complying, but carefully
   maneuvers the camera so that it remains powered on and filming while he
   starts walking away.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     We are under fire and have serious casualties, sir! We're coming in
     hot!

     HARRIMAN
     Receiving SG-1's iris code, sir!

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The blast doors to the corridor close right after the film crew and
   SFs exit the room.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [The documentary crew are escorted down the hallway. Bregman
   surreptitiously checks to ensure the camera is recording events
   transpiring behind him.]

     RUNDELL

     (to Bregman)
     This way, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (over intercom)
     Medical team to the Gate Room.

     MEDIC
     What do ya got? Whadda ya got?

     RUNDELL
     We have to clear this area.

     MEDIC
     Another fracture.

   [The blast doors to Gate Room reopen as medical staff with gurneys and
   equipment enter. The camera catches glimpses of footage, including the
   nursing staff and medics returning from the room, rushing someone by on
   a gurney. Rundell glances down and notices the camera on. He powers the
   device off and glares at Bregman.]

     BREGMAN

     (unabashed)
     Hey, sorry about that. Here, take the damn thing.

   [Bregman shoves the camera back at James. A piece of the equipment
   falls.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [The crew stands by an alcove, out of the way. James checks on his
   camera.]

     JAMES

     (surly)
     In the future, sir, could you leave the camera work to me?

     BREGMAN

     (muttering)
     Yeah, all right, I'll leave it up to you.

   [Bregman looks over and sees Carter with some other personnel
   approaching from the far end of the hallway.]

     BREGMAN
     All right, I'm gonna leave it to you. Here she comes. Turn it on,
     let's go.

   [Bregman snaps his fingers. James and Wickenhouse look to Rundell.]

     BREGMAN
     Don't look at him! We're clear to shoot here. Now come on! Just
     follow me. And bring that...bring the sound!

   [Bregman runs down the hall and approaches Carter. Her face is streaked
   with tears and she is extremely upset.]

     BREGMAN
     Major, what happened?

     CARTER

     (waving him off)
     Please.

     BREGMAN
     No, I know that at least one person was injured back there. All I
     want to say is...

     CARTER

     (with fury)
     Look, leave me alone! And shut that damn thing off!

   [Carter storms past the crew and Rundell and around the corner, leaving
   the documentary crew blinking in shock. They turn off their equipment.
   Bregman still tries to follow.]

     BREGMAN
     No, I just wanna say, how-how sorry I am...

   [Bregman is blocked by an SF at the corner where two corridors meet. He
   notices James and Wickenhouse standing where he left them several feet
   away.]

     BREGMAN
     Why is that camera off? You don't know what you're doing here. Maybe
     I know what I'm doing here. These people are risking their lives for
     us! I want to see what they're going through, even if they don't
     want us to! And I want other people to see it! What do you think
     they're doing out there? Protecting and defending secrecy?!? That's
     the world of Mao, the world of Stalin, the world of-of secret
     police, secret trials, secret-secret deaths! You force the press
     into the cold, and all you will get is lies and innuendo! And
     nothing, nothing is worse for a free society than a press that
     is-that is in service to the-to the military and the politicians,
     nothing! You turn that camera off when I tell you to turn it off!
     You think I give a damn what you think about me? You serve the
     people? So do I!

   [Various SGC personnel have been gathering during Bregman's tirade,
   since the crew is blocking a main junction of two corridors. Bregman
   storms off. Personnel move back to their destinations, and James and
   Wickenhouse quietly follow.]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Bregman sits alone at a table. The only other person in the room is a
   cleaning person mopping the floor.]

     BREGMAN
     Hi, how you doing? I don't suppose you know anything about what's
     going...on here...

   [The cleaning man glares at Bregman and moves away. James and
   Wickenhouse enter and sit at Bregman's table.]

     WICKENHOUSE
     There are multiple injuries. At least two people were hit with staff
     blasts--

     BREGMAN
     How do you know?

     WICKENHOUSE
     There was a firefight of some kind. Apparently one of the teams got
     ambushed, so they sent in SG-1, SG-5, Fraiser, and a medical team to
     extract them.

     BREGMAN
     Someone from the original team must have been badly hurt, or Fraiser
     wouldn't have gone in at all.

     JAMES
     One of the nurses said there was a casualty.

     BREGMAN
     Casualty! Someone die?

   [Rundell enters.]

     JAMES

     (nodding)
     She wouldn't say who.

     BREGMAN

     Well, Carter's a seasoned officer, she wouldn't be crying unless...
     (spots Rundell)
     I mean, we hear somebody actually may have died. What have you got?

     RUNDELL

     (upset)
     O'Neill.

   [The others look shocked.]

     BREGMAN
     You sure?

     RUNDELL
     No, I heard O'Neill's on a gurney. He took a blast. He's not moving.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   [Several cars drive into the mountain complex.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is seated at his desk. Rundell knocks and enters, Woolsey
   right behind him. Woolsey hands Hammond a folder.]

     RUNDELL
     General Hammond, Mister Woolsey.

     WOOLSEY
     General.

     HAMMOND

     (not looking at the file)
     I already know these orders originated from Senator Kinsey's office.
     Why don't you tell me the rest?

     WOOLSEY
     As Chairman of the Intelligence Oversight Committee, Senator Kinsey
     has asked that I review your command decision regarding the recent
     attempted rescue of SG-13.

     HAMMOND
     Attempted?

     WOOLSEY
     As I understand it, there were several casualties, sir. I'd hardly
     call it a success.

     HAMMOND

     (darkly)
     My command decisions are reviewed by the Chief of Staff of the Air
     Force and the President of the United States. As of yet, I haven't
     even filed a preliminary mission report. When I do, you're welcome
     to read it.

     WOOLSEY
     I have been authorized to begin a full investigation into the
     matter, as part of a larger examination of SGC strategic policy that
     the Committee is preparing for the President. I've enclosed a list
     of interviews I will be conducting, and materials I will require. We
     expect your full cooperation.

   [Woolsey turns. Rundell opens the door for him. Woolsey exits.]

     RUNDELL
     General.

   [Rundell leaves. Hammond processes this recent event.]

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Hammond enters. Carter is already there.]

     HAMMOND
     How are you holding up?

     CARTER
     I'm okay, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Did you talk to Agent Barrett?

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     He said as far as he knows, Woolsey is clean. But he did say he's as
     sharp as they come. He's got an MBA and an LLB from Harvard. He was
     lead counsel for the Army Corps of Engineers for ten years and later
     sat on the Defense Policy Board. He was asked to resign last year
     when it was disclosed that he had financial ties to a large
     corporation that had been awarded over $800 million in private
     sector defense contracts by the Pentagon. He's been with the NID
     since then. Barrett faxed me this internal NID memo Woolsey recently
     wrote. I think you should read it.

   [She hands Hammond a folder, he opens it and starts to glance through
   it.]

     CARTER

     (upset)
     What do we do, sir?

     HAMMOND
     Just tell the truth.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (pausing)
     There's going to be a memorial service on Wednesday. I think it
     would be appropriate if you said a few words.

     CARTER

     (gulping, but nodding)
     Yes, sir.

   [Hammond turns to go.]

     CARTER
     Sir?

   [Hammond turns back.]

     CARTER
     How are you holding up?

     HAMMOND

     (visibly trying to control his emotions)
     You try to tell yourself that every man and woman under your command
     means the same to you. Each has to be equally valuable if you're
     gonna make the kinds of decisions that affect their lives in the way
     I have to. But you can't help it. You get closer to some people. You
     never want to lose anyone. Well...

   [Carter struggles, but is close to tears by the time Hammond finishes
   speaking. He looks at her sadly before leaving.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   NOTE: The following sequence intercuts different and separate
   interrogations by Woolsey with individual members of SG-1. Although the
   dialogue flows freely between the various conversations, they happened
   at separate occasions, and only one member of SG-1 was in the room with
   Woolsey at any given time.

   [Woolsey stands in one corner of the room holding a report open in his
   hands as Carter enters. A tape recorder sits on top of the table, a
   corded flat microphone set up near the chair closest to the door, where
   Carter sits. A video camera sits on a tripod in another corner of the
   room.]

     WOOLSEY
     Have a seat, Major. Let me explain why I'm here.

   [Carter sits in the chair closest to the door.]

     CARTER

     (irritated)
     I know why you're here.

   [Woolsey moves to the table and activates the video camera with a
   remote control.]

     WOOLSEY
     I believe classified military operations require oversight.

     CARTER
     This isn't the first time we've been scrutinized by the NID.

     WOOLSEY
     I know the stakes around here are always high. But there were
     serious casualties in this instance. Someone of great value to this
     program is dead.

     CARTER
     I know that! And don't you dare think anyone is taking it lightly.

     WOOLSEY
     You're a seasoned combat officer, and this isn't the first time
     you've lost a close colleague. Nor do I expect it will be the last.
     I just want to make sure that it wasn't avoidable in this case.
     Despite what you might think, the only reason I am here is to get
     the truth.

     CARTER

     (irritated)
     Did you have a question?

   [Woolsey turns on the tape recorder. He begins to pace the room. It is
   now Daniel sitting in the chair.]

     WOOLSEY
     Oh yes, a few. What made you think it was safe for SG-13 to remain
     on the planet?

     DANIEL

     (flatly)
     It's not really my call.

     WOOLSEY
     But you thought it was worth risking the lives of an SG team to get
     an aerial survey of these ruins?

     CARTER
     The device was damaged. It took a while to get a proper interface,
     and the memory crystal contained an enormous amount of information.

     WOOLSEY
     So you would have me believe that this was an acceptable risk?

     DANIEL

     (slowly enunciating)
     This is what we do.

     WOOLSEY
     Make bad decisions?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, it's easier to predict the score when the game's over. And if
     we had found powerful weapons in those ruins capable of defending
     the planet against the Goa'uld, we wouldn't be having this
     conversation, would we?

     WOOLSEY

     (calmly)
     But you didn't, and we are.

   [Daniel looks away and sighs.]

     WOOLSEY
     In fact, if there had been powerful weapons in those ruins, they
     would now be in the hands of the Goa'uld. The fact is that this
     mission was botched from the beginning to the end.

     CARTER

     (upset)
     We don't just leave people behind! You can't ask airmen, soldiers,
     human beings to risk their lives without backup, without knowing
     that we would be there for them.

     WOOLSEY
     You yourself have been asked to go into combat where you knew there
     was no backup. That is always a possibility on any mission through
     the Stargate, is it not? And please, Major, none of us likes to
     admit it, but we all know that there are military situations in
     which the life of one human being has to be considered an acceptable
     loss.

     CARTER
     That wasn't the case here.

     WOOLSEY
     No, in this case, it was just dumb luck that there weren't many more
     lives lost.

     CARTER

     (barely keeping her temper)
     I would say it was skill, training, and fortitude.

     WOOLSEY
     Based on your expertise in Goa'uld tactics, was it not reasonable to
     conclude that this was an ambush?

   [Teal'c sits in the interrogation chair and stares impassively forward.
   He does not respond.]

     WOOLSEY
     While you are not an official member of our military and not
     eligible for court martial, I shouldn't have to remind you that you
     are expected to follow the orders of your superiors.

     TEAL'C
     As I was doing on the day in question.

     WOOLSEY

     (leaning forward to intimidate)
     If you fail to testify here today, I will have you jailed until such
     time that you do.

   [Daniel sneers and raises the microphone to his mouth.]

     DANIEL

     (with cold disgust)
     You fire me; you can throw me in jail; you do what you want.

   [Daniel tosses the microphone back down on the table and storms out of
   the room.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel angrily types on a computer, fighting to keep his emotions in
   check. Bregman comes to the open doorway at the far end of the room.]

     BREGMAN
     Dr. Jackson?

   [Daniel continues to stare at his computer screen.]

     DANIEL

     (voice breaking slightly)
     Yeah, it's not a good time right now.

     BREGMAN
     I-I've just been hearing bits and pieces of what happened, I was
     just hoping you might be able to confirm some of it.

     DANIEL
     Sorry.

   [Bregman notices Daniel's camcorder sitting on the edge of his work
   table. The camcorder is stained with blood. Bregman comes into the room
   and approaches the work table.]

     BREGMAN

     (pointing at the camera)
     Did you...

   [Daniel looks up from his computer and over to Bregman. His eyes widen
   and he looks stricken when he sees Bregman gesturing to the camcorder.]

   FLASHBACK

   EXT P3X-666, FOREST, DAY

   [Wells lies on his stomach in the forest, Bosworth is protecting him. A
   blood soaked bandage is over Wells's wound on his back.]

     BOSWORTH
     You're gonna be all right, Simon. Hang in there, all right, buddy?
     You'll be home before you know it.

   [Explosions are heard in the distance. Bosworth looks up to see Daniel
   and Fraiser approaching.]

     BOSWORTH
     Over here! Man down over here!

   [Daniel and Janet hurry to them.]

     BOSWORTH
     Right here. There's a lot of blood coming from underneath him. I'll
     cover you up on this ridge!

   [Bosworth moves up to the ridge. Fraiser and Daniel drop their packs.]

     FRAISER
     Yeah. I'm Doctor Janet Fraiser. Can you hear me?

     WELLS

     (in pain)
     Yeah. It hurts so bad. I can't move-I can't feel my legs. I think it
     went right through me.

     DANIEL
     What's your name?

     WELLS
     I'm Senior Airman Wells. Simon Wells. Am I going to die?

     FRAISER

     Not if I have anything to do with it.
     (to Daniel)
     Okay, we need to roll him over and stop the bleeding. Okay?
     (to Wells)
     Simon, you hanging in there?

   [Wells gives a grunt of assent.]

     FRAISER
     Okay, easy. All right, on three. One. Two. Three.

   [Fraiser holds his neck while Daniel turns Wells over. Wells screams in
   agony. Daniel puts something soft under Wells's head to make him
   comfortable as Fraiser starts to check the wound. Daniel makes eye
   contact with Wells and starts speaking to him in a soothing, calm
   manner.]

     DANIEL
     I'm Daniel Jackson.

     WELLS

     (through pain filled gasps)
     I know. I know, SG-1.

     DANIEL
     Okay, you're gonna be fine.

     WELLS
     That sonavabitch! He came out of nowhere! He shot me in the back.

     DANIEL
     Just talk about something else right now, Simon. Uh, what's going on
     at home right now?

     WELLS
     Uh, my...wife...is pregnant.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, that your-that your first?

   [Wells nods.]

     DANIEL
     Congratulations.

   [Wells winces and lets out an anguished cry. Fraiser is probing his
   wound.]

     FRAISER

     (determined)
     That's good, at least you felt that.

     AIRMAN

     (over radio)
     Colonel O'Neill, our position is being compromised! We're not going
     to be able to hold the Gate for long!

     O'NEILL

     (over radio--the transmission is garbled)
     It doesn't matter. We're not gonna be able to hold--is posit--
     for--long!

     FRAISER

     (keying radio)
     Colonel, I'm gonna need more time to stabilize this patient. He
     can't be moved yet!

     WELLS
     Go without me! Leave me!

     FRAISER

     (calmly)
     Nobody is going anywhere.

     WELLS
     I can't believe I'm not gonna see my son.

     DANIEL
     Okay. Just stay focused. Stay focused. You-you-you know it's a boy
     you're gonna have, right?

   [Wells nods briefly.]

     WELLS

     (forcefully, in pain)
     Tell me the truth. I'm not gonna make it, right?

   [Janet hands Daniel an I.V. bag of saline which he holds upright.]

     DANIEL
     You're gonna be fine.

     WELLS
     Doctor Jackson? Please-please-please, just let me just tell my
     wife--Let me tell my wife that--

   [Wells is becoming more agitated. Daniel and Fraiser exchange concerned
   looks and nod in agreement.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, okay.

   [Daniel hands Fraiser back the iv bag, which she steadies over her
   shoulder. Wells tries to stifle his agonized cries.]

     FRAISER
     Got it. Breathe, Simon.

   [Daniel fumbles with his pack and pulls out his camcorder.]

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel gets up from his chair and strides over to his work table
   quickly, snatching the camcorder from its perch and slamming it behind
   him onto his computer desk, further away from Bregman.]

     DANIEL

     (obviously upset)
     I said now's not a good time. What part about that didn't you
     understand?

     BREGMAN
     You got something on tape, didn't you?

     DANIEL

     (furious)
     Get out.

   [Daniel starts walking towards Bregman, his whole posture becoming more
   menacing.]

     DANIEL
     Get out.

     BREGMAN

     (backing away)
     Okay. I'm going. All right.

   [Daniel turns away, shaking his head and muttering to himself. He has
   reached his computer again and is fumbling with the camcorder when
   Bregman turns back around and pauses at the doorway.]

     BREGMAN
     You know I, uh...I once did a piece on this war photographer. His
     name was Martin Krystovski.

   [Daniel rolls his eyes and shakes his head in incredulity at Bregman's
   gall, keeping his back turned to Bregman.]

     BREGMAN

     (continuing)
     For about six months, he was with a unit in Vietnam, and...the day
     before he was scheduled to leave, the day before. He's out with a
     unit, and it was just a routine patrol. Or so they thought.

   [Daniel stiffens. He continues to face away from Bregman, but is
   obviously listening.]

     BREGMAN

     (continuing)
     But suddenly, the lieutenant pulled him down...and Krystovski...he
     hadn't intended to take a picture at that moment, but his hands were
     on the camera, and he hit the ground so hard that it just went off.
     And the picture captured...the lieutenant getting shot in the head.
     And Krystovski said to me--he said: "That bullet would have hit
     me--should've hit me." And he never showed that picture to anyone.
     Not for twenty-five years. But twenty-five years later, he got up
     one morning, and he looked at that picture. And he saw something
     that wasn't horrific. And he decided to tell the story because he
     realized that he hadn't accidentally taken a picture of a man dying.
     It was of a man saving his life. The picture I'm making, that I'm
     trying to make, is about what you people do every single day.

   [Daniel turns towards Bregman and studies him silently.]

     BREGMAN
     Under extreme circumstances that no one can even imagine. And I
     don't know what happened out there. I'm sorry about what happened,
     whatever it was. And if you did tape something of it, that's not
     gonna change what happened. What will change is how you feel about
     it.

   [Bregman gives an encouraging nod and backs away from Daniel, leaving
   the room. Daniel remains standing in place, lost in thought.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Woolsey sits in his chair, reading a report and making notes. Hammond
   enters with a file.]

     WOOLSEY
     General?

   [Hammond slaps the file down in front of Woolsey.]

     HAMMOND
     I've prepared a written testimony.

   [Woolsey opens the file and glances at it.]

     WOOLSEY
     This is your mission report.

     HAMMOND
     I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.

     WOOLSEY

     (dryly)
     Well, then. I guess I'm done.

     HAMMOND
     Then you'll be leaving.

     WOOLSEY
     The President will have my preliminary report by the end of the
     week.

     HAMMOND
     I'm sure it will be every bit as interesting as your memo on the
     economics of the SGC.

   [Woolsey looks up, shocked.]

     WOOLSEY
     I won't bother asking how you got that.

     HAMMOND
     What was the dollar value you attributed to an SG team member?

     WOOLSEY

     You know damn well I wasn't pegging the value of a person's life. It
     is a cold, hard fact that it costs millions of dollars to train
     these men and women, and that is a fraction of the funds being
     subverted by the Pentagon for this operation.
     (standing)
     I think it is reprehensible that the taxpayers of this country are
     paying enormous sums of money to wage a war they know nothing about,
     and are getting little, if anything, in return. If the Stargate's
     existence were public knowledge, and your actions were being judged
     in the court of public opinion--

     HAMMOND
     You're the one suggesting that sending a rescue team worth $27
     million to save the life of one man is a bad business decision.

     WOOLSEY

     (annoyed)
     You're putting words in my mouth.

     HAMMOND
     You said it in black and white, and I don't think you would dare do
     such a thing if this wasn't a classified operation. The President
     has asked a documentary team to get to the truth of what's going on
     around here. Why don't we just go down and give them the whole truth
     as you see it? Right now.

   [Woolsey gathers his files. Hammond glares at him with disgust.]

     WOOLSEY
     That memo is classified. This investigation is classified. If you so
     much as utter even a hint of either, I'll see you are put away in a
     cold, dark place for the rest of time.

   [Woolsey leaves. Hammond remains, visibly trying to compose himself.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Hammond is moving swiftly down a corridor when Rundell meets him.]

     RUNDELL
     General!

     HAMMOND
     What is it, Colonel?

     RUNDELL
     Security caught Mister Bregman trying to access the infirmary, sir.
     He claims he was lost, but I've shown him all around this complex...

     HAMMOND
     Get rid of him.

     RUNDELL
     Sir? Have our orders changed, sir?

     HAMMOND
     Toss him out on his ass, Colonel.

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [James and Wickenhouse pack their equipment while Rundell supervises.
   Bregman enters the room and looks around in surprise.]

     BREGMAN
     What's this? What's going on?

     RUNDELL
     Mister Bregman, sir, General Hammond has ordered you off the base.

     BREGMAN
     No, no he can't do that.

     WICKENHOUSE
     He is a general.

     BREGMAN
     Stop packing.

   [Bregman rushes out of the room.]

     RUNDELL
     Keep packing.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Harriman stands, apparently briefing Hammond, who is seated behind his
   desk. Bregman opens the door and enters without knocking.]

     HAMMOND
     You have one hour to get off my base and out of my sight forever.

     BREGMAN
     Whose authority?

     HAMMOND
     My superiors.

     BREGMAN
     You think I stepped over the line. I don't. I just wanna make a
     phone call.

     HAMMOND
     Call whoever you want on your way out. There's a payphone at the
     surface.

     BREGMAN

     (gesturing)
     Actually, I'd like to borrow your red one.

     HAMMOND

     (coldly)
     You have some nerve, Mr. Bregman.

     BREGMAN
     That's what my mother used to say.

   [Bregman moves towards the phone. Hammond slaps his hand down over the
   receiver and stands, glowering at Bregman. Bregman rocks back on his
   heels, looking annoyed and frustrated. He leaves, slamming the door
   shut behind him.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel stands staring distractedly at a computer screen. Hammond
   enters the office. Daniel glances up at him before turning back to his
   desk.]

     HAMMOND
     I've been ordered to turn over the tape.

   [Daniel stiffens before moving over to his other computer.]

     HAMMOND
     Look, I'm not happy about it either. I could fight it. The tape
     could get lost or accidentally erased, these things happen, but I'm
     not going to do that. You know, I had that little weasel of a man
     thrown out of here, but in light of the NID's latest investigation,
     I'm starting to think maybe there should be a record of what goes on
     here beyond the classified reports.

     DANIEL

     (skeptically)
     And you trust Bregman to portray that?

     HAMMOND
     At the moment, I have no other choice.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel slams a camcorder tape labeled P3X-666 down on the table.
   Bregman and Hammond are standing by the door. Bregman reaches out with
   his hand and tries to say something, but Daniel ignores the gesture and
   storms out of the room without saying a word. Bregman goes over to the
   table and picks up the tape. Hammond watches him stonily as Bregman
   leaves the room.]

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [James works on some of the editing equipment. Bregman enters and
   tosses him the camcorder tape.]

     BREGMAN
     Hey, hey. I got the tape. Put it on.

   [James fumbles to open the cassette sleeve and put the tape into their
   playback device. Bregman takes the seat next to him and opens his
   notebook. Rundell opens the door and enters the room. He is carrying a
   large envelope labeled "TOP SECRET".]

     RUNDELL
     Preliminary mission file's been declassified...

     BREGMAN

     (waving him off impatiently)
     Just a minute.

   [Wickenhouse moves from the sofa to also watch the tape.]

   DANIEL'S VIDEOTAPE OF P3X-666

   [Wells face takes up the entire screen, he is crying and in obvious
   anguish.]

     DANIEL

     (audio only)
     Okay, you can tell her yourself.

     WELLS

     (crying)
     I'm so sorry about this. Ah! I love you so much...God, I-I just-I
     just wanted...

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [The group shifts uncomfortably at watching Wells's torment. Bregman
   drops his pen.]

   DANIEL'S VIDEOTAPE OF P3X-666

   [Wells starts screaming in agony and squirming on the ground. The
   camera shakes.]

     WELLS
     Oh God! God! Shut it off! Shut it off! I don't want her to see me
     die! Please! God!

   [The camera shifts again. Fraiser now appears on-screen. She is looking
   directly at Wells, and brushing the hair away from his face. Daniel's
   camera angle shifts between Wells's face and Fraiser's.]

     FRAISER
     Simon. Simon! Look at me! You are not going to die, okay?

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [Bregman's eyes widen, and he is visibly moved by the footage.]

   DANIEL'S VIDEOTAPE OF P3X-666

   [Wells has calmed down while Fraiser continues speaking to him.]

     FRAISER
     I did not come all the way out here for nothing. Now, I've stemmed
     the bleeding. We're going to get you on a stretcher. We're going to
     get you home with your family in no time, okay? Now you hang in
     there, Airman!

     WELLS
     Yes, ma'am!

   [A staff blast flares across the screen and strikes Fraiser. She falls
   backwards, out of the camera's view.]

     WELLS
     Oh God, what was that? Is she hit?

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [Bregman is stunned by what he has just seen. James puts his fist to
   his face in shock.]

   DANIEL'S VIDEOTAPE OF P3X-666

   [Audio picks up an automatic weapon's fire. Daniel's camera shifts
   erratically from Wells to Fraiser. Smoke is curling upwards from her
   chest. Her eyes are wide open, and she lies on the forest ground,
   unmoving.]

     BOSWORTH
     I got him!

     DANIEL
     Janet?!?

     BOSWORTH
     You're clear, Doctor Jackson! Sorry, but...

   [The camera shifts away quickly showing a blurred forest ground and
   then turning over to see the sky and tree tops. Daniel has obviously
   dropped the camera.]

     DANIEL

     (anguished)
     I need a medic! Fraiser's hit! I need a medic!

   INT--VIP ROOM

   [The group watches in horror as the audio from the tape echoes through
   the room. Rundell fumbles to open his top secret envelope.]

     WELLS

     (from videotape)
     Is she okay?

     DANIEL

     (frantically into radio--from videotape)
     Sierra Gulf Niner, Doctor Fraiser's been hit. Position....aah! I
     NEED A MEDIC!

   [James turns off the video. Rundell reads the paper that was in the
   envelope.]

     RUNDELL

     O'Neill's alive. So is Airman Wells.
     (choking up slightly)
     Doctor Fraiser didn't make it.

   [Rundell quickly leaves the room. Everyone else remains in shocked
   silence.]

   INT--INFIRMARY, PRIVATE ROOM

   [The door opens and Carter enters, moving towards O'Neill, who is
   sitting on a patient bed, pulling a black t-shirt down over his
   bandaged abdomen.]

     CARTER
     Sir? I heard you were up and around.

     O'NEILL

     (with a pained grunt)
     Yeah. Still a little tender, but they said I could go home.

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     We're lucky that staff blast hit you where it did. The new vest
     insert works well.

     O'NEILL
     Didn't help Fraiser much.

     CARTER

     (trying to remain composed)
     No.

     O'NEILL
     How's Cassie?

     CARTER

     (forcing composure)
     She's a strong kid. She survives. You know.

     O'NEILL

     (sighing)
     Yep.

   [He gets up and pulls a green BDU overshirt on.]

     O'NEILL
     You speaking at the memorial?

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER

     (fighting tears)
     Sir, I just wanted to say...when you were lying there, I...I'm
     really glad you're okay.

   [Carter can no longer hold in her emotions, and she starts to weep.
   O'Neill approaches her.]

     O'NEILL
     Come here.

   [Carter and O'Neill hug each other tightly.]

   INT--INFIRMARY

   [Medical staff work on various patients. Daniel enters and approaches
   Wells's bed. Wells has his eyes closed. Daniel looks at his vitals, and
   Wells opens his eyes, noticing Daniel instantly.]

     WELLS
     Doctor Jackson.

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     Hey. Please, just, uh, call me Daniel. So, I hear you're going to
     make a full recovery?

     WELLS
     That's what they say.

     DANIEL
     You, uh, you talk to your wife?

     WELLS
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     Everything's okay?

     WELLS
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     I never asked you when she was due.

     WELLS
     Couple of weeks. They say I should be out of here by then.

     DANIEL
     That's great.

     WELLS
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     I-I just, uh, I wanted to see how you were doing, so, uh...

   [Daniel turns to go.]

     WELLS
     She's dead because of me.

   [Daniel turns back to Wells.]

     DANIEL
     No. No, she's dead because a Jaffa shot her. She was doing her job.
     Same way you were doing yours when a Jaffa shot you.

     WELLS
     I can't make it feel right.

     DANIEL

     (shaking his head)
     It wasn't right. Nothing about it was right. But it also wasn't your
     fault.

   [Wells studies Daniel's expression for a moment, then nods. Daniel
   returns the nod, then leaves.]

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Carter, in civilian clothes, sits in front of her laptop, openly
   crying. Teal'c enters, holding a paper. When he sees Carter's emotional
   state, he moves to her. Carter notes his approach and tries to compose
   herself.]

     CARTER
     Hey, Teal'c.

   [Teal'c bows his head in acknowledgment.]

     CARTER

     (gesturing to laptop)
     General Hammond asked me to speak at the memorial service.

     TEAL'C

     (softly)
     I am aware.

     CARTER

     (voice breaking)
     I don't know what to say. Nothing seems good enough.

     TEAL'C
     I believe you should only speak from your heart.

   [Carter jumps off her stool, looking lost and as if needing escape.]

     CARTER
     I've got to go pick up Cassie.

   [Teal'c grabs her arm gently. She stops and looks at him.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter. I have pondered what I would say were I given the
     chance.

     CARTER
     Really?

     TEAL'C
     I believe it would be best if it came from you.

   [He hands Carter the paper. She opens it and reads it. She smiles
   through her tears and nods.]

     CARTER
     Okay.

   [Carter pulls Teal'c into a hug, crying softly. Teal'c returns the
   embrace.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [A spotlight shines on the empty bed. The rest of the room is dark.
   Bregman enters, looking around for a moment as if searching for someone
   or something, then turns to go.]

     DANIEL

     (unseen)
     Over here.

   [Bregman stops at the doorway and looks around again.]

     BREGMAN
     Oh. I was told that you might be in here, Doctor Jackson.

   [Daniel sits crouched in a darkened corner of the room.]

     DANIEL
     Yep.

     BREGMAN
     I just, uh, came by to, uh, give this back to you. I'm not gonna use
     it.

   [He lays the tape gently down on the infirmary bed, then starts to
   leave.]

     DANIEL
     Wait.

   [Bregman turns. Daniel stands up and moves toward the bed.]

     DANIEL
     I want you to.

   [Daniel puts his hands in his pockets, staring at the tape and the
   bed.]

     DANIEL

     You know, I died in this room? Ascended. Doctor Fraiser did
     everything she could. I think she went three days without sleep.
     (smiling at the memory)
     Even in the end she didn't want to let me go. I owed her...a lot
     more than I ever gave back.

   [Daniel picks up the tape.]

     DANIEL
     I thought a lot about what you said about Krystovski. I think this
     shows what Janet Fraiser was all about.

     BREGMAN

     (surprised)
     Me too.

     DANIEL

     (soberly)
     I want other people to know.

   [He holds out the tape to Bregman with a steady hand. Bregman
   approaches and takes the tape. He leaves. Daniel remains standing
   there, then looks to the ceiling, his eyes filling with tears.]

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The United States and SGC flags are set up on the ramp with a podium,
   wreath and red flag. A bugler stands on the ramp and plays Taps. The
   room is filled with SGC personnel, military in full dress uniforms,
   Daniel and Teal'c in all black suits. Everyone is very somber. The
   documentary crew is also dressed for the occasion, filming the
   memorial. Once the bugler is finished, Carter approaches the podium.]

     CARTER
     Janet Fraiser was an extraordinary person. She was kind and funny
     and talented. Above all, she was courageous. Try as I might, I could
     not find the words to honor her, to do justice to her life.
     Thankfully, I got some help.

   [Carter looks at Teal'c, who nods in acknowledgment.]

     CARTER

     (continuing)
     While words alone may not be enough, there are some names that might
     do. We often talk about those that give their lives in the service
     of their country. And while Janet Fraiser did just that, that's not
     what her life was about.
     (Her voice trembles for a moment, then she rallies.)
     The following are the names of the men and women who did not die in
     service, but who are in fact alive today because of Janet: Major
     Samantha Carter. Doctor Daniel Jackson. Colonel Jack O'Neill.
     Teal'c...

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [A monitor screen shows Carter's image from the memorial fading out as
   a flying flag fades in. Her voiceover continues as documentary music
   swells. Hammond and Bregman are watching the video.]

     CARTER

     (continuing)
     ...Sergeant Connie Smith. Major Ian Hules. Senior Airman Simon
     Wells...

     NARRATOR

     (via voiceover)
     Our armed forces have turned the tide of world wars. Young men and
     women from our great country's four corners have humbled history's
     worst tyrants. We carve our thanks in stone.

   [While the narrator speaks, still photographs of SG teams appear across
   the screen.]

     NARRATOR

     (continuing)
     We stamp it into medals. We carefully tend to vast fields where the
     men and women who gave their lives for our freedom now lay. More
     than ever in our history, we cannot fail to pass these stories of
     courage to the next generation. We must capture their imaginations
     while paying tribute to all those willing to die for the
     preservation of our way of life.

   [The video shows an image from the briefing room window of the Stargate
   dialing before the blast door closes. A trumpet plays in the
   background.]

     HAMMOND

     (to Bregman)
     It's a shame no one's ever going to see it.

     BREGMAN

     (stopping the video)
     Really? You-uh, you don't think it's a little sentimental?

     HAMMOND

     (softly)
     No. It's good.

     BREGMAN
     Well, that's a relief...hearing that from you of all people.
     Especially given how you felt about what I was doing. I mean, I
     understood how you felt, but still.

   [Hammond stands and comes around his desk.]

     HAMMOND
     I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm wrong. I'm glad you stuck
     with it.

   [Hammond reaches out his hand, and Bregman shakes it in pleased
   surprise.]

     BREGMAN
     Um, that means a lot to me, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (searching for words)
     I've written a lot of letters to the next of kin. Nothing ever seems
     like it's enough. They deserve more....This is something more.

     BREGMAN
     Thank you, sir.

   [Hammond holds back his emotions with a great deal of effort. Bregman
   pauses for a moment.]

     BREGMAN
     Um...there is one thing, General, that's still missing that could
     make a difference...

     HAMMOND

     (chuckling)
     I'll take care of it.

   [Bregman gives a satisfied smile, then leaves. Hammond stays lost in
   thought, partly choked up.]

   EXT--THE WELLS' HOME, COLORADO SPRINGS, DAY

   [Wells answers a knock on the door. The caller is Daniel, smiling and
   holding a small teddy bear, with which he waves one paw at Wells.]

     WELLS
     Hey! Come in, come in.

   INT--THE WELLS' HOME

   [Daniel follows Wells into the home. Wells walks with difficulty using
   a cane. His wife sits on the living room sofa, surrounded by pillows, a
   small infant cradled in her lap.]

     WELLS
     Daniel, this is my wife Marci.

     MARCI

     (smiling)
     Hi.

     DANIEL
     Hi.

     MARCI
     I'd love to give you a hug, but...

   [She gestures helplessly at the sleeping child. Daniel crouches down
   next to the sofa studying the baby. He sets the teddy bear down on the
   sofa.]

     DANIEL
     Please, don't get up.

     WELLS
     This is my daughter.

     DANIEL

     (with wonder)
     Oh, she is beautiful.

     MARCI
     Thanks.

     DANIEL
     Guess that ultrasound was wrong, huh?

     MARCI

     (chuckling)
     Yeah.

     DANIEL
     What's her name?

   [Marci and Wells exchange looks.]

     WELLS
     Janet.

     DANIEL

     (after a pause)
     That's nice.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [A video camera films O'Neill sitting in the chair, in his dress
   uniform. Wickenhouse sets up a microphone on his lapel. O'Neill shifts
   uncomfortably. James adjusts the video camera. Bregman sits at the
   other end of the table, his notes at ready. Studio lights are set up
   behind him, facing O'Neill. Rundell approaches from behind.]

     BREGMAN

     Okay, um...
     (notices Rundell)
     Tom?

     RUNDELL
     Emmett.

     BREGMAN

     (to James)
     You ready?

     JAMES
     Rolling.

     BREGMAN
     Sound? Okay. Um...First question.

     O'NEILL

     (softly)
     Okay.

   FADE OUT
