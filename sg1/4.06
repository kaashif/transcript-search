   TEASER

   FADE IN

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET

   [The planet's sun is extremely bright. A roll of thunder is heard in
   the distance. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are near the Stargate. Teal'c
   and Carter are setting up some equipment while O'Neill keeps guard.
   O'Neill checks his watch and walks over to Carter. He looks at the sun
   through a filter and sees that there are flares all around it.]

     O'NEILL
     Is this supposed to be doing that?

     CARTER
     It's a corona mass emission, like a giant solar flare.

   [O'Neill looks through the filter again and back at Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     But it's safe, right?

     CARTER
     Judging from the planet's magnetic field, it might cause a
     significant increase in the surface radiation.

     O'NEILL
     But it's safe, right?

     CARTER
     As long as we don't stay here too long, yes, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Anybody explain that to Daniel?

   [He turns round to look at Daniel, who is with another man. He is
   excitedly taking rubbings of the writing on the ruins by a large
   pedestal.]

     DANIEL

     (to the man)
     I've encountered this script before. It's err...similar in
     pronunciation to a language on our planet called Latin. Now, as near
     as I can tell, the main body of the text represents a kind of
     planetary history.

     MALIKAI
     I agree. But isn't it time for you to return through the Stargate?

     DANIEL
     But I don't understand of what the significance of this is. (He
     indicates the pedestal)
     . It could be some sort of control mechanism. It's obviously still
     in working order compared to the rest of the ruin. I wonder if
     that's significant?

   [While Daniel is talking about the pedestal, the man looks nervous and
   takes a device out of his bag. He looks at Daniel who is still
   fascinated by the pedestal.]

     MALIKAI
     The storm is approaching, Dr Jackson. The radiation may be dangerous
     for you and your team.

     DANIEL
     Oh yes, Major Carter will let us know when we have to leave. Now
     this line recurs several times: 'Dommo waitus, westol notibilium.'

     MALIKAI
     Conqueror of time.

     DANIEL
     No, in this context I'd say more like 'master of the uncertain
     past.'

     MALIKAI
     You're a skilled linguist, Dr Jackson.

     DANIEL
     Oh...thank you. Actually I had the opportunity to hear the language
     spoken aloud a year or two ago.

   [The device in Malikai's hands bleeps and Malikai looks towards the
   sky. Daniel looks puzzled.]

     DANIEL
     What's that?

     MALIKAI
     The geomagnetic disturbance is reaching its peak. I have to act now.

   [Daniel looks to SG-1 whilst Malikai retrieves a weapon from his bag
   and aims at Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (shocked)
     I don't understand!

   [Malikai shoots Daniel with the energy weapon and he falls to the
   ground, unconscious. Malikai runs to him and pulls Daniel off to one
   side, out of sight. He then goes to the pedestal and starts pushing at
   the stones on it. The mechanism on the pedestal activates.]

   EXT--STARGATE IN THE TEMPLE

   [Carter and Teal'c are finishing setting up the research equipment.]

     CARTER
     All set up, sir.

     O'NEILL

     Good. Let's hit it.
     (He stands and activates his radio)
     Daniel, let's go home.

   [There is no response.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

   [They look to where Malikai is and hear an energy buildup.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I hear it.

   [Suddenly the pillars in the temple start to arc energy between
   themselves powerfully and the chevrons on the Stargate flicker on and
   off. SG-1 look around alarmed as the Gate activates, and throw
   themselves on the floor to avoid the vortex.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The sound of the Gate activating is heard and the alarms are going
   off.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Incoming wormhole.

   [Hammond walks over to him and stares at the Gate. Suddenly the same
   arcing energy from the alien planet appears over the iris. Hammond
   looks alarmed.]

     HAMMOND
     What is that?

     TECHNICIAN
     I have no idea, sir.

   [They both stare at the Gate.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c have their weapons ready. The energy is
   still around the Gate.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting to Malikai)
     Are you doing this?

   [Malikai turns round as they approach him.]

     MALIKAI
     Stay away!

   [O'Neill and Carter notice Daniel unconscious on the floor. Carter runs
   to him.]

     CARTER
     Daniel!

     O'NEILL
     What the hell are you doing?

   [He runs and grabs Malikai with Teal'c.]

     MALIKAI
     Stay back!

   [They try to move him away from the pedestal but are engulfed in a
   bright light. Carter looks up from tending to Daniel in surprise.]

     CARTER
     Colonel!

   [The light intensifies...]

   INT--SGC COMMISSARY

   [Daniel is sitting opposite O'Neill, who is eating fruit loops. Carter
   is next to Daniel. They are all eating breakfast. Daniel is talking
   excitedly to O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it.
     What do you think?

   [O'Neill looks up, surprised, just before he eats his spoonful of fruit
   loops. He stares at Daniel and Carter, confused.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [Daniel looks at Carter, frustrated.]

     DANIEL
     What do you think?

   [O'Neill looks around.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, is something wrong?

     O'NEILL
     Maybe!

   [He looks at his fruit loops and back at Daniel and Carter.]

   END OF TEASER

   INT-COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are sitting around the table eating
   breakfast as before. O'Neill looks confused.]

     O'NEILL
     Weren't we just somewhere else?

   [Carter looks at him, then at Daniel, confused]

     DANIEL
     Where?

     O'NEILL
     Some planet.

     DANIEL
     When?

     O'NEILL
     Just now.

     DANIEL
     No.

     O'NEILL
     You sure?

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [O'Neill looks around, very confused, and puts his spoonful of fruit
   loops down.]

     O'NEILL
     Everything just changed.

     CARTER
     Sir, we've been sitting in the commissary for the past half-hour.

     O'NEILL
     Really?

     DANIEL

     (sarcastically)
     Well, it is understandable how you could have gotten the two places
     confused.

   [Carter looks amused, then looks at her watch and stands up.]

     CARTER
     We're going to be late for the briefing.

     O'NEILL
     Briefing?

   [Daniel and Carter look at each other.]

     DANIEL
     Are you ok? Or are you just trying to avoid answering my question?

     O'NEILL
     I'm fine...What question?

   [He gets up and leaves, followed by Carter and Daniel.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond and SG-1 are there. Carter is standing up in front of a large
   screen with a sun's schematic on it.]

     CARTER
     Two weeks ago SG-15 took these images of solar activity on P4X-639.
     Analysis of the data indicates a steady increase in the intensity.
     Now if I'm right the explosions that we're witnessing here are just
     the precursor for an exponentially greater violent ejection.

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter, have we not previously been briefed concerning this
     matter?

     O'NEILL
     I was just going to say that.

     CARTER

     (puzzled)
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     You wanna go to the planet and set up some kind of remote
     observatory.

   [Daniel and Hammond look at O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     We just did that.

     DANIEL
     No we didn't.

     TEAL'C
     I believe we did, Daniel Jackson.

     HAMMOND
     No, Teal'c, that's what this briefing is about.

     O'NEILL
     I distinctly remember sitting here listening to Carter prattle on
     about solar activity and err corona something.

     CARTER
     Corona mass emission. I was just about to bring it up.

     O'NEILL

     (gesturing to Carter)
     There you go. How would I know that?

     CARTER
     Maybe you read my report?

   [Daniel taps his file on the table and speaks sarcastically to
   Carter...]

     DANIEL
     Maybe he read your report?

   [O'Neill gives Daniel an annoyed look.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm telling you guys, we've done this before.

   [Daniel looks skeptical.]

     TEAL'C
     I am in agreement with O'Neill. I am experiencing a great deal of
     familiarity with these events.

   [Suddenly the sound of the Gate opening is heard and the sirens go
   off.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (via intercom)
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [They all leave the briefing room to go down to the control room.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

   [The technician is at the control computer as Hammond and SG-1 enter.]

     TECHNICIAN
     We have an unscheduled incoming traveler, sir.

     O'NEILL
     It's SG-12.

     HAMMOND
     They're not due back for days.

     TECHNICIAN
     Receiving GDO transmission...

   [The computer readout verifies that it is SG-12 coming through the
   Gate.]

     TECHNICIAN
     It's SG-12.

   [Daniel and Carter look at O'Neill, who just smirks.]

     HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

   [The sound of the iris opening is heard.]

     TEAL'C
     One of them will be injured.

   [O'Neill nods at this comment.]

   [SG-12 walk through the Gate. One member is hobbling and is being
   supported by another. Hammond looks at O'Neill, stunned. O'Neill just
   raises his eyebrows.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY

   [Carter and Hammond are walking along it discussing the situation.]

     HAMMOND
     What do you make of all this?

     CARTER
     Well, sir, I'm not sure.

     HAMMOND
     SG-12's early return was the result of an accident. One of the team
     fell and broke his ankle. How could Teal'c and Colonel O'Neill know
     that was going to happen?

     CARTER
     Both of them claim to have memories of SG-1's mission to P4X-639.

     HAMMOND
     A mission that isn't scheduled to start for another six hours.

   INT--IMFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is shining a light in O'Neill's eyes. He squints at her.
   Daniel is standing to the side and Teal'c is in the background being
   examined by a nurse.]

     DANIEL
     Ok so...Sam was setting up instruments and...where was I?

     O'NEILL
     You were by the altar deal with the guy.

     DANIEL
     Right, you're going to need to be a bit more specific.

     TEAL'C
     Malikai.

   [The nurse puts a thermometer in Teal'c's mouth.]

     DANIEL
     That's the alien archaeologist that SG-15 met on the first survey. I
     was looking forward to meeting him.

     O'NEILL
     You did! You got along swell. Anyway at some point a beam shot out
     from the ruins around the altar and in the Stargate.

   [Teal'c removes the thermometer from his mouth.]

     TEAL'C
     There was a blinding flash of light.

     O'NEILL
     Then I was back in the commissary eating my fruit loops.

   [Fraiser looks at him, startled that he would eat fruit loops. Carter
   and Hammond enter the infirmary.]

     FRAISER

     (to Hammond)
     Well, sir, I can't find anything wrong with either of them. Now,
     we'll have to wait for the lab results to be sure but they both
     appear to be in perfect health.

     CARTER
     Except for the fact that they're remembering events that haven't
     even happened yet.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but why Jack and Teal'c and not us?

     HAMMOND
     I'm not taking any chances. Until we figure out what's going on I'm
     postponing your mission to P4X 639.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill is walking down a corridor. He looks at his watch just as
   Daniel jogs round the corner after him carrying a bundle of papers.
   O'Neill taps his watch as if he were expecting Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, wait up.

   [O'Neill turns to face Daniel, who stops to let an airman past.]

     DANIEL
     I was thinking about what you said about...err...a beam coming out
     of the altar. Now SG-15 took digital images of the carvings on the
     ruins.

   [He hands O'Neill some images to look at.]

     DANIEL
     I was thinking that there might be some sort of a clue in here about
     what's going on. Unfortunately it's the equivalent of about 400
     pages of alien text. But if you could give me more details about the
     layout of the alien ruins it might be useful...

   [Suddenly Sgt Siler comes jogging around the corner and runs straight
   into Daniel, knocking him to the floor. All of the images scatter
   everywhere.]

     SILER
     Gee, sorry, Dr Jackson.

   [Siler and another airman help Daniel to his feet.]

     O'NEILL
     Should have seen that coming.

   INT-COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill is sitting drinking a cup of coffee, looking bored, as Carter
   walks in. She looks at him expectantly and rests her hands on the
   table.]

     CARTER
     So?

   [O'Neill looks up at her.]

     O'NEILL
     So?

   [Carter sits down at the table.]

     CARTER
     Don't you know what I'm going to say?

   [O'Neill looks at his watch.]

     O'NEILL
     Actually, by this time we were on the planet. It's all different
     now.

     CARTER
     Oh, well, I was thinking about what you said, about a beam hitting
     the Stargate.

   [O'Neill looks at her apparently without interest.]

     O'NEILL
     What about it?

   [He distractedly removes a particle from his cup and flicks it away.]

     CARTER
     After the flash you found yourself back here. And then you were
     basically reliving the moments up to the mission. Maybe you're not
     remembering future events. Maybe you were sent back in time.

     O'NEILL
     For what, 6 hours?

     CARTER
     Well, it wouldn't be the first time we've seen something like this.
     I mean the Stargate did send us back to 1969.

     O'NEILL

     (smiling)
     Good year.

     CARTER
     So I was wondering. Could this beam you mentioned be a means to
     access the Gate's subspace field in order to create some kind of
     time inversion outside of subspace?

   [O'Neill looks at her for a moment.]

     O'NEILL
     I knew you were going to say that.

   [Carter laughs softly at him.]

     CARTER
     I guess I was just thinking out loud...I'm going to go run a few
     simulations.

   [She gets up and leaves O'Neill to finish his coffee.]

     O'NEILL
     You run...simulate...let me know how it turns out...keep me posted.

   [He puts his cup down.]

     O'NEILL
     Keep me apprised.

   [He closes his eyes.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond is standing, reading a report on O'Neill and Teal'c, who are
   standing awaiting the results. Hammond looks up and speaks to them.]

     HAMMOND
     The lab results confirm Dr Fraiser's original assessments. You're
     both in perfect health. Any more of these premonitions?

     TEAL'C
     Not for some time.

     O'NEILL
     Can we go back to work now, General, please?

     HAMMOND
     I have no objection as long as...

   [Suddenly the sound of the Gate activating is heard and the alarms go
   off.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (on intercom)
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [Hammond exits his office followed by O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     D'oh!

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The iris is closed as the Gate opens and the energy arcing effect is
   seen again.]

   INT-CONTROL ROOM

   [The computer display shows an unknown error to the Gate as Hammond,
   Teal'c and O'Neill enter. They all stare at the Gate.]

     HAMMOND
     What is that?

     TECHNICIAN
     I'm not sure sir. I've never seen anything like it.

     O'NEILL
     We have.

   [He looks to Teal'c as they are enveloped in a blinding light again..
   ..]

   INT--COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are all at breakfast. O'Neill is eating
   fruit loops as before.]

     DANIEL
     Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it.
     What do you think?

   [O'Neill puts his spoon down, shocked, sits back in his chair and looks
   at his watch. Carter and Daniel stare at him, puzzled.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, something wrong?

   [O'Neill looks at her.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah, something.

   [He looks to the side, annoyed.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond and SG-1 are in the room. Carter is standing in front of a
   large screen with a sun's schematic on as before.]

     CARTER
     Two weeks ago, SG-15...

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     We've done this!

   [He closes his folder and drops it on the table. Carter, Hammond and
   Daniel stare at him.]

     DANIEL

     (sarcastically)
     We do this every day.

   [Daniel resumes reading through the mission notes. O'Neill looks at him
   irritated.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm not talking about briefings in general, Daniel. I'm talking
     about this briefing. I'm talking about this day!

   [He looks around at the others, who seem confused. Teal'c is quietly
   considering the situation.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill is correct. Events do appear to be repeating
     themselves.

     DANIEL
     Since when?

     O'NEILL
     Since we went to P4X 639.

     CARTER
     We haven't been to P4X 639.

     O'NEILL

     Yes we have...
     (He points at Daniel)
     No we haven't. That's what you were going to say.

     DANIEL
     Of course that's what I was going to say.

     O'NEILL

     (shaking his head)
     Ok, bad example.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, I'm not sure what to make of all of this.

     CARTER
     If we've had this meeting before sir...

     O'NEILL
     Why are Teal'c and I the only ones who remember it? I know, that's
     what you said last time.

   [He looks around.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, I'll venture a guess that it has something to do with that
     planet.

   [The others look unconvinced.]

     O'NEILL

     And you'll all believe me
     (He looks at his watch)
     when SG-12 come through that Gate in four...three...two...one...

   [He raises his finger expectantly but nothing happens. The others look
   at him and O'Neill taps at his watch.]

     HAMMOND
     SG-12 isn't due back for 3 days.

   [The Gate activates, sirens go off.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (on intercom)
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [O'Neill looks triumphant and balls his hands into fists.]

     O'NEILL
     So close!

   [They all head for the control room.]

   INT--INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is once again examining O'Neill and Teal'c. She shines a
   penlight into O'Neill's eyes.]

     O'NEILL
     You're not going to find anything.

     FRAISER
     Why don't we wait for the lab results before we jump to any
     conclusions?

     TEAL'C
     The results will be negative.

     FRAISER
     Humor me.

   [Hammond and Carter enter.]

     FRAISER

     (to Hammond)
     Well sir...

   [O'Neill raises his hand and interrupts.]

     O'NEILL
     General, I know you're thinking of postponing the mission but
     there's no point. We tried it last time and it didn't work.

   [Hammond looks to Daniel, who doesn't know what to say. A nurse puts a
   thermometer in Teal'c's mouth and he sighs.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [As before, O'Neill is walking down a corridor. Instead of looking at
   his watch he is just counting the seconds until Daniel jogs round the
   corner after him carrying a bundle of papers.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, wait up.

   [O'Neill raises his arms and turns to face Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Err...I was thinking about what you said about a beam coming from
     the altar...

   [O'Neill points at the papers that Daniel is carrying.]

     O'NEILL
     Four hundred pages of alien text.

   [Daniel is shocked.]

     DANIEL
     Right, SG-15 took digital images of the carvings on the ruins.

   [He hands the papers to O'Neill who looks at them.]

     O'NEILL
     Looks familiar.

     DANIEL
     It should, it's something that you spoke for a few days. It's a
     variation of the writings used by the Ancients.

     O'NEILL
     Well, if you're looking for help translating it you're barking up
     the wrong genius.

   [He hands the papers back to Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     No, I realize that the Asgards returned you to normal, which
     is...fortunate I suppose. But err if you could give me more details
     about the layout of the ruins it might be useful...

   [Sgt Siler again comes jogging around the corner and runs straight into
   Daniel, knocking him to the floor. The pages scatter everywhere.]

     SILER
     Gee, sorry, Dr Jackson.

   [Siler and another airman help Daniel to his feet.]

     O'NEILL
     Ooops.

   EXT-CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill knocks at the door. Teal'c is with him.]

     HAMMOND
     Come in.

   [They enter the office. Hammond is sitting at his desk.]

     O'NEILL
     Any word from Fraiser?

     HAMMOND
     She's still waiting for the lab results.

     TEAL'C
     If we delay any longer it will be too late.

     HAMMOND
     Too late for what?

     O'NEILL
     To stop this day from happening again!

     HAMMOND
     You realize that this is a little difficult for me to accept.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, if it were just me I'd agree. But what about Teal'c? Come on,
     is this the face of a crazy man?

   [He points to Teal'c who stares at Hammond. Hammond looks at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Bad example.

     HAMMOND
     What do you want?

     O'NEILL
     We wanna go back to 639.

   [Hammond considers the request.]

   EXT--P4X 639

   [The sun is still acting strangely and distant thunder is heard. The
   Stargate is seen opening in the distance.]

   EXT--RUINS ON P4X 639 [SG-1 step through the Gate with their weapons
   ready. Carter looks at a small instrument in her hand.]

     CARTER
     A geomagnetic storm is building up, we shouldn't stay long.

   [O'Neill points towards the platform.]

     O'NEILL
     That's the machine right there.

   [They walk towards the pedestal.]

     CARTER
     I wonder how it works?

     O'NEILL
     Subspace fields and time inversions.

   [Carter looks at O'Neill surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     It's what you said.

   [They see Malikai and O'Neill aims his weapon at him, followed by
   Carter.]

     MALIKAI
     Hello.

   [He raises his arms in the air.]

     DANIEL
     Woah, easy guys!

     O'NEILL
     That's the guy, that's the one who started all this.

     MALIKAI
     I don't understand.

     O'NEILL
     Whatever you did, I want you to undo it.

     MALIKAI
     I did nothing!

     CARTER
     Colonel, I don't think he knows what you're talking about.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps he has no memory, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, he remembers. He's the one who was pushing all of those buttons.

   [Malikai walks towards the pedestal.]

     MALIKAI
     Please, I'm an archaeologist. I've been trying to translate these
     alien symbols. I...I told the others that came before you.

     DANIEL
     SG-15?

     MALIKAI
     Yes, but they didn't point weapons at me. I can show you my notes.

   [He reaches for his bag but O'Neill yells and moves towards him.]

     MALIKAI
     I've been making periodic visits to this planet for some time now.
     My research is almost complete.

   [O'Neill searches through Malikai's bag. He finds the weapon.]

     O'NEILL
     What kind of archaeologist carries a weapon?

     DANIEL

     (stepping forward)
     Err...I do.

     O'NEILL
     Bad example.

   [O'Neill takes another object out of the bag and activates it. It shows
   a photograph of a smiling woman.]

     O'NEILL
     What's this?

     MALIKAI
     If you must know, it's my wife.

   [Suddenly the pedestal activates again and the stones on it move. The
   energy buildup starts again and SG-1 step back, alarmed.]

     O'NEILL
     What did you do?

     CARTER
     I didn't do anything. It engaged on its own.

     O'NEILL
     Turn it off.

     CARTER
     How?

     MALIKAI
     It's drawing energy from the ionization in the atmosphere. There's
     nothing Major Carter can do.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me? How'd you know her name?

     MALIKAI
     You told me.

     O'NEILL
     No I didn't. Not this time around.

   [Malikai knows he has been discovered and drops his hands.]

     MALIKAI
     It doesn't matter. You're too late.

     O'NEILL
     How do you shut this thing off?

   [The energy buildup increases.]

     MALIKAI
     Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.

     CARTER
     Sir, it's building up some kind of charge.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, you know how to read this stuff. Get up here and shut it
     off.

     DANIEL
     What?

   [He walks up to the pedestal and stares at it.]

     DANIEL
     Are you kidding me? I wouldn't even know where to begin, I mean it
     would take years to translate. I don't even have enough...

   [The energy buildup, the Stargate activates and they are enveloped in a
   blinding light...]

   INT--COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are all at breakfast. O'Neill is eating
   fruit loops as before.]

     DANIEL
     Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it.
     What do you think?

   [O'Neill drops his spoon into the bowl and grabs his forehead in
   frustration. Carter looks at him, shocked.]

     DANIEL
     It was just a question.

   [O'Neill takes his hand away from his head and stares at them.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond and SG-1 are there. Carter is standing in front of a large
   screen with a sun's schematic on as before. She is about to start
   speaking when O'Neill interrupts. He and Teal'c are standing behind
   their chairs.]

     O'NEILL

     All right, here's the deal. We're all stuck in a time loop of some
     kind. However Teal'c and I seem to be the only ones who realize it.
     Now there's this alien device on six thirty nine. It shoots a beam
     at the Stargate which...err subspace something...
     (He looks at Teal'c)
     What?

   [Hammond, Daniel and Carter stare at him.]

     TEAL'C
     Accesses the subspace field the Stargate is capable of generating.
     It is powered by ionization.

   [Carter walks towards them, intrigued.]

     O'NEILL

     In the atmosphere, right. Which is caused by...
     (He points at Teal'c)
     I know this one...
     (He thinks about it)
     Magnets!

     TEAL'C
     The geomagnetic storm.

     O'NEILL
     Of course. Anyway I don't know why none of you remember this. But I
     do know for a fact there's no point in having old Doc Fraiser
     examining us again!

   [He looks around at the others who all seem very puzzled.]

   INT--INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser is once again shining the penlight into O'Neill's eyes. He
   seems fed up and annoyed.]

     O'NEILL
     I ask you. What could possibly be in my eye that could explain this?

   [The nurse puts the thermometer in Teal'c's mouth again and he sighs,
   looking at the nurse.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR NEAR INFIRMARY

   [Carter and Hammond are once again walking along it discussing the
   situation.]

     HAMMOND
     What do you make of all this?

     CARTER
     Well sir, when was the last time you heard Colonel O'Neill use terms
     like subspace field and geomagnetic storm?

     HAMMOND
     Good point.

     CARTER
     And he actually used them correctly...for the most part.

     HAMMOND
     You believe him?

     CARTER
     Well I'm considering the possibility, sir. I mean the more I think
     about it, if he's right the ramifications are huge.

     HAMMOND
     And the next time loops we'll forget this conversation even
     happened.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is gathering the photographs of the writings from P4X 639 to
   take to show O'Neill. Just as he is about to leave the room O'Neill
   enters, followed by Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     You're better off in here.

     DANIEL
     I was just coming to look for you.

     O'NEILL
     I know.

   [Daniel puts the papers on a table]

     DANIEL
     Err...I've managed to translate a section of the west wall.

   [He taps a touch sensitive computer screen to show the section of the
   wall.]

     DANIEL
     It appears to be some sort of planetary history.

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, that's very nice, but focus on the altar.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     TEAL'C
     Malikai initiated the time loop by manipulating the symbols on the
     surface.

     O'NEILL
     Figure out the symbols, figure out how to stop this!

     DANIEL
     Just because someone can recognize symbols on a keyboard doesn't
     mean they can run a computer. If I can translate the rest of the
     text I can put the device in a proper context and figure out what
     it's supposed to do.

     O'NEILL

     (loudly)
     We know what it does! It's a time loop machine.

     DANIEL
     Err...Think about it. Who would build a device that loops time every
     ten hours?

     O'NEILL
     Who knows? But that's what it does.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but maybe that's not what it's supposed to do. I mean for all
     we know that's just an accidental by-product of its true function.

   [The phone rings and Daniel picks it up.]

     DANIEL

     Hello...Ok we're on our way.
     (He puts the phone down)
     Sam has something.

   [They leave Daniel's office.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [There is a schematic of a galaxy on the computer screen. Carter steps
   forward to begin talking to Hammond and the rest of SG-1.]

     CARTER
     According to Colonel O'Neill, in the first loop he and Teal'c
     witnessed a beam striking the Stargate on P4X 639. Then the Gate
     became energized somehow. But now in the second loop at the exact
     same moment they witnessed a similar effect in our own Gate room
     here on Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Sounds about right.

     CARTER
     Ok, so if we really are under the influence of an alien technology
     then the effect is clearly being translated to Earth via the
     Stargate. In which case the solution is simple.

   [She looks at the others to see if they realize.]

     DANIEL
     We dial out.

     CARTER
     Exactly, a few minutes before this is set to begin again we
     establish an outgoing wormhole to, I don't know...say the Tollan
     home world, and anyone or anything trying to dial in from P4X 639
     will get a busy signal.

   [O'Neill looks to Hammond, who nods.]

     HAMMOND
     Let's do it.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Gate is dialing out. Base alarms are going off.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

   [SG-1, Hammond and a technician are gathered around the console.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron five locked.

   [A computer screen shows the dial out sequence progressing.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron six locked.

   [The Gate continues to spin. The seventh chevron slides into place but
   doesn't light up. They all stare at the Gate.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron seven will not engage.

     CARTER

     (surprised)
     What?

     TECHNICIAN
     It won't lock. I can't establish a connection.

     CARTER
     I'm running a diagnostic.

   [Suddenly the Gate begins to spin.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Incoming wormhole.

     HAMMOND
     Close the iris.

   [The iris closes. Armed guards take up position in front of the Gate.
   O'Neill sighs and looks at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh crap!

     CARTER
     This doesn't make any sense, there's nothing wrong on our end. We
     should have been able to dial out.

   [The Gate opens and the energy arcs again. Carter looks to O'Neill, who
   just waves his hand, as the light engulfs them all and the loop starts
   again...]

   INT--COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are all at breakfast. O'Neill is eating
   fruit loops as before.]

     DANIEL
     Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it.
     What do you think?

   [O'Neill just puts his spoon down and sits back in his chair.]

     O'NEILL
     Ask me tomorrow.

   [Daniel looks confused, as does Carter. O'Neill closes his eyes for a
   moment and then looks off to the side, very fed up.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is looking at a computer screen with the images that SG-15
   took, with O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     DANIEL
     ...Just because someone can recognize the symbols on a keyboard
     doesn't mean they can run a computer...

   [O'Neill waves his hands for Daniel to stop.]

     O'NEILL
     We've been over this!

   [Daniel stops and looks at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     I'm telling you, the only way to stop this loop...
     (He touches the screen to bring up images of the pedestal)
     ...is to figure out how to run that stuff.

   [Daniel looks at the screen.]

     DANIEL
     If we really have had this conversation before then I probably
     pointed it out to you that there's no way I can translate this
     entire text in less than a day.

     O'NEILL

     Oh, I am so ahead of you.
     (He retrieves a tape recorder from the table)
     I put the whole thing on tape last time so you don't have to start
     from scratch.

   [He presses play, but nothing is heard. Daniel looks at him. O'Neill
   hits the recorder onto the table in frustration, to get it working.]

     DANIEL
     If what you say is true, then when the loop started again then your
     recording wouldn't have happened...yet

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   [O'Neill puts the tape recorder down.]

     TEAL'C
     Did I not say that your plan would be unsuccessful?

   [O'Neill raises a finger at Teal'c to shut him up.]

     O'NEILL

     Careful...be careful.
     (To Daniel)
     What about notes? Indelible ink?

   [Daniel just looks at him.]

     DANIEL
     Look, if you guys are the only ones with memories of previous loops,
     then you're going to have to help me by learning and remembering.

     O'NEILL

     Fine.
     (He picks up one of the images)
     How hard can it be?

   [Daniel takes it from him, turns it the right way around and gives it
   back to O'Neill.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter and Hammond are standing in front of a schematic on the
   display, discussing the situation.]

     CARTER
     According to Colonel O'Neill, in a previous loop we attempted to
     block the connection with P4X 639 but we were unable to dial out. I
     think what's happened is that the Earth has become in a sense out of
     sync with the rest of the Gate system, making it impossible for us
     to establish contact with these worlds.

     HAMMOND
     What about SG-12, they managed to Gate in?

     CARTER
     I realize that, so we ran a sequence of random dialings and this is
     what we found.

   [She begins the display. It shows some Gate locations lighting up.]

     CARTER
     These were the worlds we were able to contact, including Alaris, the
     planet where SG-12 was doing its survey. At the center of this group
     is P4X 639. I believe that the alien device is establishing a
     simultaneous connection with all of these gates, creating a kind of
     subspace bubble, and that everything within the bubble is cut off
     from the normal flow of time.

     HAMMOND
     What are the implications of this?

     CARTER
     Well sir, we could be reliving the same day over and over maybe
     thousands of times and we'd never know it.

     HAMMOND
     What can we do?

     CARTER
     Unfortunately not much. By the next time this loop starts we won't
     even remember we had this conversation. It's up to Teal'c and
     Colonel O'Neill.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill is looking bored and reading a book entitled 'Latin for the
   Novice' by Joseph Mallozzi Ph.D. Teal'c is next to him, also studying.]

     O'NEILL
     Poteramus, pottera, protarat, cram, eras, crat, cramus...

   [Daniel is writing on a chalkboard, translating some of the text.
   O'Neill puts the book down and puts his hands up to his head.]

     O'NEILL
     This is a bad idea.

     TEAL'C
     It would appear we have no choice.

   [The alarms go off and the technician is heard over the intercom.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Unscheduled off world activation.

   [O'Neill sighs and looks at Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     You know the worst part about this? Every time we loop Daniel asks
     me a question and...I wasn't listening the first time.

     TEAL'C
     You are not the only one who must endure some discomfort, O'Neill.

   [The light envelops them and the loop begins again.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c is walking along the corridor when an airman opens a door in
   front of him and hits him in the face.]

     AIRMAN
     Sorry sir, I didn't realize you were there!

     TEAL'C

     (annoyed)
     You have said that on many occasions.

     AIRMAN
     I...

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps next time I will not be so forgiving.

   [Teal'c walks off, leaving the airman staring after him.]

   [There is another flash of light and another loop starts...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are sitting at the desk facing Daniel who is
   translating. They both look very bored and O'Neill is playing with two
   scrunched up balls of paper.]

     DANIEL
     Section twenty three ends with a reference to perennial inventus.

     O'NEILL
     We've been over this.

   [Daniel turns around surprised.]

     TEAL'C
     I believe it means the approaching disaster.

     DANIEL
     Good.

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are again helping as Daniel translates onto the
   chalkboard. Teal'c is staring at his hands, evidently very bored.]

     DANIEL
     ...On the machine itself. With recurring use the machine surrenders
     to the rigors of time...

     TEAL'C
     That is incorrect, Daniel Jackson.

   [Daniel turns around and looks at them.]

     O'NEILL

     (casually)
     The word abiceerum means to give up, not surrender.

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [This time O'Neill is spinning around on his chair in boredom and
   Teal'c is reading while Daniel is explaining the same thing to them.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their
     arrival on P4X 639...

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel walks towards the chalkboard.]

     DANIEL

     Ok, now this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their
     arrival on P4X 639
     (He points at a symbol)
     Now this word here, deductavum, is a derivation of devuctum.

   [O'Neill begins to juggle with some scrunched up balls of paper as he
   sits in his chair. Teal'c looks at him.]

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill is standing, expertly juggling three balls of paper.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their
     arrival on P4X 639.

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [This time O'Neill is sitting down looking at Teal'c, who is juggling
   balls of paper.]

     DANIEL
     ...Appears to be a reference to the gradual degeneration of the
     machine itself...

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is looking at the chalkboard.]

     DANIEL
     ...Foundation of a colony.

   [He turns around and sees both O'Neill and Teal'c expertly juggling,
   and stares at them in disbelief.]

     DANIEL
     Guys, are you getting this, 'cause this is important?

   INT--COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill is sitting with his legs up on the table looking bored. There
   is an empty plate in front of him and he is holding containers of
   ketchup and mustard. He looks up as Teal'c enters.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, should we not be assisting Daniel Jackson with the
     translation?

   [O'Neill starts to draw on the plate with the ketchup and mustard.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm taking this loop off.

   [Teal'c considers this and sits down.]

     O'NEILL
     I'm telling you, Teal'c. If we don't find a way out of this soon I'm
     going to lose it.

   [Teal'c stares at him.]

     O'NEILL

     Lose it...it means go crazy, nuts, insane, bonzo, no longer in
     possession of one's faculties,
     (He continues drawing on the plate with the condiments.)
     three fries short of a happy meal...WACKO!

   [He lifts up the plate to show Teal'c that he has drawn a smiling
   face.]

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [O'Neill is writing the translation on the chalkboard as Daniel and
   Teal'c watch. O'Neill finishes a line and walks towards Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     Thank you, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     No, no, thank you Teal'c.

   [He hands Teal'c the chalk and sits down as Teal'c takes over. O'Neill
   leans back in the chair and puts his hands to his face in frustration.]

     DANIEL
     Exactly how many of these loops have you...have we been through?

     O'NEILL
     I've lost track.

     DANIEL
     That must be frustrating.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Err...yeah!

     DANIEL
     On the other hand it's kind of an opportunity.

     O'NEILL
     How's that?

     DANIEL
     Well think about it, I mean if you know in advance that everything
     is always going to go back to the way it was then...you could do
     anything for as long as you want without having to worry about the
     consequences.

   [O'Neill looks at him, then at Teal'c. They consider what he has said.
   O'Neill stands up.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me.

   [He leaves quickly, followed by Teal'c. Daniel just stares after them,
   surprised.]

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   [A Gate room technician is standing in the corridor. He hears a bicycle
   bell. He turns round in surprise and sees O'Neill cycling down the

     Fine...sir!

   [There is another flash of light and another loop...]

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Gate is open. O'Neill and Teal'c are playing golf through the
   Gate. They are both dressed in golf outfits and have set up some astro
   turf at the foot of the ramp. Teal'c takes a shot through the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah! That's how to play.

   [He walks up to take a shot.]

     O'NEILL
     How far is Alaris anyway?

     TEAL'C
     Several billion miles, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     That's got to be a record!

   O'Neill looks up and turns around to face the control room angrily.

     Colonel, what are you doing out of uniform?

   [O'Neill looks at his watch.]

     O'NEILL
     Handing you my resignation.

   [Hammond looks at him, shocked. Carter stands up.]

     CARTER
     Resigning, what for?

     O'NEILL

     So I can do...

   Hammond.]

   casually, and smiling.]

     CARTER
     What are you smiling at?

     O'NEILL

     (still smiling)
     Nothing.

   [Daniel is standing at the front of the table in front of the computer
   display of the images from P4X 639. He is reading some notes. Hammond
   sits at the table reading the briefing papers.]

     HAMMOND
     What have you got for us, Dr Jackson?

     DANIEL

     Err...with the help of Teal'c and...
     (He points at O'Neill and raises his eyebrows)
     ...Jack, I've managed to complete the translation.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c look up.]

     DANIEL
     As I originally suspected, P4X 639 was once a colony of the
     Ancients. They thrived there for thousands of years, until they were
     struck by some sort of unspecified cataclysm, perhaps a disease, but
     we'll never really know for sure. In any case, facing certain
     destruction, they built a time machine.

     O'NEILL
     They were going to go back and change their history, to avoid their
     fate.

     DANIEL
     Right, but it didn't work. Instead of sending a team of scientists
     back to the key moment in their history, the device caused a short
     term continuous loop. Just like the one we've been experiencing.
     They experienced the same day dozens, perhaps hundreds, of times,
     trying to get the machine to work, but in the end they gave up, they
     shut it down and...let the end come.

     HAMMOND
     So the loop can be broken?

   [O'Neill nods silently at Hammond. Daniel walks over to the computer
   screen.]

     DANIEL
     Err...there's a section of text on the altar that deals specifically
     with the geomagnetic storms that power the device. Apparently they
     recur every fifty or so years which is why, incidentally...

   [O'Neill interrupts frustrated.]

     O'NEILL
     Yes sir! The loop can be broken.

   [He looks at Daniel, who has stopped talking.]

     DANIEL
     I was getting to that. When we activate the symbols on the altar in
     the right sequence I think we can shut it down.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, have your team geared up and ready to embark in thirty
     minutes.

     O'NEILL
     Yes sir!

   [He gets up to leave.]

   EXT--P4X 639

   [SG-1 exit the Stargate. Carter reads her instruments.]

     O'NEILL
     The geomagnetic storms are building up. We shouldn't stay long.

   [Carter looks at him, shocked.]

     O'NEILL
     Lucky guess.

   [He shrugs his shoulders. They make their way cautiously over to the
   altar and Malikai.]

     O'NEILL
     Malikai!

     CARTER
     I don't see anyone, sir.

     O'NEILL
     He's around here somewhere and he knows we're on to him.

   [He gives a hand signal for them to fan out in their approach. Teal'c
   approaches the altar area first and is suddenly thrown back by a force
   field, unconscious.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

   [They all rush over to him. Carter kneels beside him to help and
   O'Neill moves towards the force field. We see Malikai approach the
   altar and take his sunglasses off calmly.]

     MALIKAI
     I'm sorry, but you've come to break the time loop and I'm afraid I
     can't let you do that.

   [O'Neill watches as Malikai works at the altar.]

     O'NEILL
     Get away from that thing!

   [Malikai looks up but doesn't do anything. O'Neill picks up a stone. He
   throws it but it just rebounds off the barrier, narrowly missing
   O'Neill and Daniel.]

     CARTER
     It's no good, sir. It looks like a variation of a Goa'uld force
     shield.

     MALIKAI
     In fact it is, Major. I had to trade several rare artifacts for the
     field generator but it was well worth it.

   [He continues working at the altar. Daniel approaches the force field.]

     DANIEL
     Malikai, we have to reset those controls or the loop is going to
     restart itself again.

     MALIKAI
     I'm counting on it. I need more time. Once I've correctly deciphered
     the symbols on the altar I will be able to master the time device.

     O'NEILL
     Why, so you can be king of Groundhog Day?

   [Malikai looks up.]

     MALIKAI

     Do you think I would do this for personal power? She...
     (he stops what he is saying)
     ...You wouldn't understand.

     O'NEILL
     What happened?

   [Malikai considers the situation.]

     MALIKAI
     She died...twelve years ago. When I found this place and discovered
     its true purpose I dedicated myself to unlock its mysteries.

     CARTER
     So you could go back and save her.

   [Teal'c awakens and is helped to his feet.]

     MALIKAI
     No, that would be quite impossible. She died from a congenital heart
     weakness. Not even the ability to travel time could change that.

     O'NEILL
     Then why are you doing this?

   [He takes his sunglasses off.]

     MALIKAI
     To be with her once more.

   [He returns to his work at the altar. Daniel also takes his sunglasses
   off.]

     DANIEL
     Malikai, the device doesn't work.

   [Malikai looks up suddenly.]

     DANIEL
     It never did.

     MALIKAI
     It never did? You're living proof.

     DANIEL
     We finished translating the text on these ruins. The Ancients who
     built this place never got it to work. They tried over and over
     again, just like you. But in the end they just gave up. Why do you
     think this place has been deserted for so long? They couldn't save
     themselves.

     MALIKAI
     You're wrong. There must be some other explanation. I can make this
     work!

     DANIEL
     You can't! They proved it can't be done. You're just going to go on
     like this forever. You'll be trapped!

     TEAL'C
     Along with billions of innocent others.

     CARTER
     This device activates fourteen Stargates simultaneously. That's
     fourteen worlds re-living the same day over and over.

   [Malikai considers the situation.]

     MALIKAI
     I err...I didn't realize.

   [He looks down at his equipment as it signals the coming of the storm.]

     MALIKAI
     But it doesn't matter. Once I am able to input the correct time
     coordinates the loop will be broken.

     O'NEILL
     The people who made that machine are the same ones who made the
     Stargates and they couldn't get the damn thing to work. And even if
     you could, just for the sake of arguing,...you can't change what
     happened to her.

     MALIKAI
     I can touch her face again and talk with her, hear her laugh.

     O'NEILL
     Like you remember?

     MALIKAI

     (emotionally)
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     And then what'll happen?

     MALIKAI
     She'll die.

     O'NEILL
     And then what? You'll start over?

   [Malikai looks down. The altar suddenly activates for the next loop and
   the energy builds up again.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen to me, I know what it's like.

     MALIKAI
     You can't!

     O'NEILL

     (angrily)
     I lost my son, I know...and as much as I...I could never live that
     over again.

   [Malikai looks at O'Neill sadly.]

     O'NEILL
     Could you?

     MALIKAI

     (sadly)
     No.

     O'NEILL
     Let her go.

   [Malikai reaches forward slowly and deactivates the altar. The energy
   buildup stops and the force field is lowered. O'Neill walks towards
   Malikai and takes the photograph of Malikai's wife from his bag. He
   hands it to Malikai who looks at it sadly then at O'Neill.]

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [The Gate is active and the iris is open. SG-1 step through. Hammond
   enters the Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Well, we're still here, Colonel. I assume you were successful?

     O'NEILL
     Well, General, you know what they say. If at first you don't
     succeed, try, try, try, try, try again.

   [He follows the rest of SG-1 out of the Gate room.]

   INT--COMMISSARY

   [O'Neill is eating a giant spoonful of oatmeal from a large bowlfull.
   Daniel and Carter are staring at him.]

     DANIEL
     I don't think I've ever seen anyone enjoy oatmeal so much.

     O'NEILL
     When you've been eating fruit loops for who knows how long, a little
     variety helps.

     CARTER
     We got a message from the Tok'ra. Apparently they've been trying to
     contact us for over three months.

   [O'Neill looks up, not surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     Really?

     CARTER
     Who knows when they first realized that we were cut off? I mean,
     there's really no telling how much time passed.

     DANIEL
     Let me ask you something. In all the time that you
     were...err...looping, were you ever tempted to do something crazy?

   [O'Neill looks up. Carter seems interested in the answer.]

     DANIEL
     I mean...you could do anything without worrying about the
     consequences.

     O'NEILL
     You know, it's funny. You asked me that before.

     DANIEL
     And?

   [O'Neill just looks at Carter with a small smile on his face. Carter
   looks at Daniel, puzzled. O'Neill takes another big spoonful of oatmeal
   and eats it.]

   FADE OUT

   THE END
