   EXT--OFF-WORLD

   [Panorama of ancient ruins; camera closes in on crumbling ziggurat.]

   INT--ZIGGURAT ENTRANCE

   [Daniel is studying the ancient writings on a large 'door' of some
   kind.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, I thought you said this was the main entrance.

     DANIEL
     It is. We just need to find a way to open this.

     TEAL'C
     I do not recognize the symbols.

     DANIEL
     It's Babylonian. Cuneiform. It's incredible.

     O'NEILL
     What is?

     DANIEL
     Well, unlike Phoenician Ugarite cuneiform, these characters are
     pictograms rather than representations of unique sound symbols.

     O'NEILL
     Does it say how to open the pyramid?

     DANIEL
     Ziggurat.

     O'NEILL
     Huh?

     DANIEL
     You said pyramid. It's a ziggurat.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Open the door.

     DANIEL
     Well, it might not be so easy. I'm going to have to go back to Earth
     for a reference.

     O'NEILL
     How hard could it be?

     DANIEL
     Very. It's a dead language. I mean, I doubt if anyone's even stood
     here for 3,000 years.

     CARTER
     Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

     O'NEILL
     What you got there?

     CARTER
     An empty pack of cigarettes. They're Russian.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--BASE

     HAMMOND

     (voice only)
     Major.

     CARTER

     (voice only)
     The Russian Stargate Program was only up for 37 days.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER
     We've seen their logs and the list of planets they visited, and P2X
     338 was not one of them.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps they deceived us.

     HAMMOND
     At the moment all they're admitting to is that there may have been
     some unauthorized use of their Gate.

     O'NEILL
     What's that supposed to mean?

     HAMMOND
     This is Major Valentine Kirensky. He was serving under Colonel
     Sakolov at the base in Siberia. It now appears that he was also
     taking secret orders from certain hard-line elements in Russian Army
     Intelligence. He disappeared six days before we were called in to
     deactivate the Russian Gate.

     CARTER
     And they think he went off-world?

     HAMMOND
     Along with two other officers and an archaeologist named Alexander
     Britski.

     DANIEL
     I know his work. He's an expert on ancient Mesopotamia.

     O'NEILL
     Why would they go behind Sakolov's back?

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps for the same reason the NID conducted off-world operations
     without the knowledge of Stargate Command.

     DANIEL
     To steal alien technology at any cost.

     CARTER
     But why 338 as opposed to any other planet?

     HAMMOND
     That has yet to be determined.

     DANIEL
     If they went through the Gate before everyone at the Russian base
     was killed, they could still be out there.

     CARTER
     It's doubtful they would've survived this long. The planet's surface
     temperature averages 135 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade.

     O'NEILL
     Shade? I don't remember shade.

     DANIEL
     They could've taken shelter in the temple.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, so they figured out how to open the door?

     DANIEL
     I'll figure out the door.

     TEAL'C
     Should they not have attempted to return by now?

     CARTER
     Not without exposing their operation. I mean, they could still be
     waiting for some kind of signal.

     O'NEILL
     She's got a point, sir. Russian commandos can be pretty hard-core.
     They'd wait forever before they'd violate mission protocol.

     HAMMOND
     I'm aware of that, Colonel. That's why we're going to allow a second
     Russian team to accompany you back to the planet.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

     HAMMOND
     It's going to be a joint mission--full disclosure, full cooperation.

     O'NEILL
     May I ask why, sir?

     HAMMOND
     In fact, the Russians have been pushing for more direct involvement
     in the Stargate Program for quite some time. We've been resisting,
     but in this particular case, it might be useful to have them
     onboard.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, well, General, you know, I'm a big fan of the Russians, and
     international relations are a bit of a hobby of mine. However, I do
     believe that SG-1 should handle this one... alone.

     HAMMOND
     The decision's been made, Colonel. They're on their way.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Carter and O'Neill are just entering from the hallway. Daniel is at
   his computer.]

     CARTER
     Because we have an agreement, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Did you see them holding up their end of it?

     CARTER
     Well, have we?

     O'NEILL
     No.

     CARTER
     If Thor's ship hadn't crashed into the ocean, we would never even
     have told them about the Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, whose side are you on?

     CARTER
     I'm just saying that we should at least try to work together.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, when you go through that Gate, you gotta know your team
     members are watching your six.

     DANIEL
     Actually, in Russian, they'd be watching your shest.

     O'NEILL
     Huh?

     DANIEL
     Which I suppose is neither here nor there.

     O'NEILL
     Have you figured out how to open that pyramid yet?

     DANIEL
     Ziggurat. And yes, I think I have. In order to expedite matters, the
     Russians e-mailed me the entire report of their archaeologist, Dr.
     Britski. The temple is dedicated to the Babylonian God, Marduk.

     CARTER
     And Marduk was a Goa'uld?

     DANIEL
     Well, it seems likely. The word "Babylon" literally means "Gate of
     the Gods," so if there is a connection, it wouldn't surprise me.

   [Telephone rings. Daniel gets it.]

     DANIEL
     Hello?

   [Daniel listens.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah, okay.

   [Daniel hangs up.]

     DANIEL
     The Russians are coming.

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [The Russians are waiting. Major Vallarin gets himself a coffee, tastes
   it, and grimaces.]

     VALLARIN

     (In Russian)
     Ugh! The greatest superpower on Earth, and they can't make a decent
     cup of coffee.

   [Colonel Zukhov turns away from the windows to the Stargate room, which
   are blocked by the blast doors.]

     ZUKHOV
     Nice view.

     VALLARIN

     Oh, yeah.
     (Sees SG personnel coming)
     Colonel.

     HAMMOND
     Good morning, gentlemen.

     O'NEILL
     And ma'am. There's a ma'am, sir.

     HAMMOND
     At ease. You must be Colonel Zukhov.

     ZUKHOV
     It's a pleasure to meet you, General Hammond. Allow me to introduce
     Major Vallarin, and Lieutenants Marchenko and Tolinev.

     HAMMOND
     Welcome to Stargate Command. This is Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major
     Samantha Carter, Dr. Daniel Jackson, and Teal'c.

     ZUKHOV
     The famous Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Hmm?

     ZUKHOV
     I believe we have a mutual friend.

     O'NEILL
     We do?

     ZUKHOV
     Dr. Svetlana Markov.

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

     ZUKHOV
     She spoke very highly of all of you.

     HAMMOND
     Before we proceed, perhaps you would like to get some rest and maybe
     something to eat.

     ZUKHOV
     We took the precaution of eating before we came.

     VALLARIN
     What Colonel Zukhov means is that we'd like to get to work as
     quickly as possible.

     HAMMOND
     Very well. Dr. Jackson.

   [Daniel goes to large screen, dims lights, and starts a PowerPoint
   presentation.]

     DANIEL
     Two years ago, Dr. Alexander Britski began an excavation near Rafha
     in Southern Iraq. He found several stone tablets engraved with
     Babylonian cuneiform, and one with a set of symbols he didn't
     recognize.

     CARTER
     Gate coordinates.

     DANIEL
     In fact, the coordinates for P2X-338. Dr. Britski had no idea of
     their significance, but someone must have recognized something,
     because the results of the dig were never published, and the whole
     thing became classified.

     O'NEILL
     Wait a minute. Two years ago, the Russians hadn't even seen a
     Stargate.

     DANIEL
     But they did have a DHD--the one discovered by the Germans in 1906
     and taken by the Red Army at the end of the Second World War.

     CARTER
     So when they finally got their program up and running, they must
     have added P2X 338 to the list of addresses supplied by Colonel
     Maybourne.

     O'NEILL
     That doesn't explain why they didn't just send a regular team.

     HAMMOND
     Did Dr. Britski discover anything that might suggest why they
     singled this planet out?

     DANIEL
     Along with the coordinates, the tablet included a reference to
     something called "The Eye of Tiamat." It was a large jewel of some
     kind which supposedly endowed Marduk with great magical abilities.

     O'NEILL
     That wouldn't be why you folks wanted to keep this quiet?

     ZUKHOV
     Need I remind you, Colonel, that the United States has operated a
     Stargate in secret for years with the express purpose of obtaining
     alien technology.

     O'NEILL
     That was before we had an agreement to share information.

     ZUKHOV
     You took it upon yourselves to represent the interests of the entire
     planet without consulting anyone. You exposed the world to countless
     dangers.

     O'NEILL
     At least we dealt with them. It only took you folks what, a month,
     to find something you couldn't handle.

     HAMMOND
     Gentlemen, please. We seem to have gone a little bit off-topic here.

     VALLARIN
     Dr. Jackson, what about the entrance? Can you get us inside?

     DANIEL
     Uh, yeah. The engravings of the entranceway are a kind of code. It's
     like a giant combination lock. It's just a matter of activating the
     correct symbols in the proper sequence.

     HAMMOND

     I have the utmost confidence in your abilities, Doctor.
     (To O'Neill)
     You have a go.

     O'NEILL
     Swell.

   INT--HALLWAYS OF SGC

   [O'Neill and Zukhov are on their way to the Gateroom.]

     ZUKHOV
     Is that a P-90, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     50-round horizontal clip, 900 armor-piercing rounds per minute. Feel
     the weight of that sucker.

     ZUKHOV
     Impressive... Though I prefer the Russian Zastava M85.

     O'NEILL
     Those are made in Yugoslavia, aren't they?

   INT--GATE ROOM

     TECHNICIAN

     (via Control Room intercom)
     Chevron 7 locked.

   [Gate activates.]

     O'NEILL
     SG-1, move out.

   [SG-1 goes through the Gate.]

     ZUKHOV

     (in Russian)
     Stay in close formation. If you get separated, maintain contact on
     channel 3.

   [The Russians salute him and head out through the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     What was that all about?

     ZUKHOV
     I was just wishing them the best of luck.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Look, Zukhov, let's get something straight here. I'm the
     ranking senior officer on this mission.

     ZUKHOV
     This is a joint operation, and we are of equal rank.

     O'NEILL
     Which means you should appreciate the need for a clear chain of
     command.

     ZUKHOV
     Of course.

     HAMMOND

     (via Control Room intercom)
     Colonel? Is there a problem?

     O'NEILL & ZUKHOV

     (at the same time)
     No, sir.

   [Hammond waves them on to the Stargate. At the top of the ramp, O'Neill
   gestures Zukhov in.]

     O'NEILL
     After you.

   [Zukhov enters. O'Neill gives Hammond a grimacing little smile. Gate
   shuts down.]

   EXT--RUINS

   INT--ZIGGURAT ENTRANCE

   [Everyone is waiting on Daniel, who is reading and studying the
   entrance to the ziggurat. They've clearly been waiting for some time.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel.

     DANIEL
     Just about there.

     O'NEILL
     You said that an hour ago.

     DANIEL
     Look, if you want to give this a try, be my guest.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, break out the C4.

     DANIEL
     Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I got it. It's
     a standard retelling of the Babylonian creation myth. Marduk slays
     the winged serpent Tiamat. He cuts her in two. He uses half of her
     to create the sky and the other half to create the earth.

     VALLARIN
     How does that help us, Dr. Jackson?

     DANIEL

     Well, you see, some of the text has been deliberately placed out of
     order. Only a priest of Marduk would be able to spot the
     discrepancies.
     (He looks for places to press)
     Here.
     (Stone moves in)
     Here.
     (Stone moves in)
     And here.

   [Stone moves in. Entrance opens with great shaking of the ziggurat,
   stones falling.]

     O'NEILL
     Nice job.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

   [Dark and dusty. Crumbling. Stone dust falling, giving scene a smoky
   appearance.]

     CARTER
     This doesn't seem very stable.

     DANIEL
     It's over 4,000 years old.

     O'NEILL
     Which way?

     DANIEL
     I don't know.

     ZUKHOV
     We should split up. You take your team down here, and we'll go down
     there.

     O'NEILL
     All right, but Teal'c goes with you... for your own protection.

     ZUKHOV
     And perhaps you should take Lieutenant Marchenko. For the same
     reason.

     O'NEILL
     Fine. Move out.

     ZUKHOV
     Marchenko...

   [He speaks in Russian].

   [The teams split up. Carter finds someone leaning against a wall.]

     CARTER
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Identify yourself.

     MARCHENKO

     (In Russian)
     Identify yourself.

   [Flashlights show it's a skeleton in military rags.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh.

   [Carter checks out the body.]

     O'NEILL
     One of yours?

     MARCHENKO
     Da.

     DANIEL
     If these men disappeared 10 months ago, how could one of their
     bodies completely decompose that fast?

     CARTER
     It didn't decompose. This skeleton's covered in tiny teeth marks.

     O'NEILL
     Something ate this guy?

     CARTER
     Stripped the flesh right from his bones.

     MARCHENKO

     (In Russian)
     Holy shit.

     DANIEL
     You can say that again.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [Zukhov's team has find a room with a sarcophagus.]

     TEAL'C
     It appears to be a sarcophagus.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

   [Marchenko covers the skeleton with a jacket.]

     O'NEILL
     Zukhov, this is O'Neill.

     ZUKHOV

     (via radio)
     What is it, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     We found one of Kirensky's men. He's dead. Exercise extreme caution.

     ZUKHOV
     Understood. We found a sarcophagus. We're investigating.

     O'NEILL
     Negative. Hold your positions till we get there. Zukhov, respond.
     Zukhov!

   [Zukhov doesn't respond; speaks in Russian to his people, who move
   toward the sarcophagus.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn it. Fall back.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

     TEAL'C
     You are disobeying a direct order.

     ZUKHOV
     I trust Colonel O'Neill won't take it personally.

   [When Zukhov steps up on sarcophagus platform, he sets off a booby
   trap. A loud noise begins, similar to the sound the ziggurat entrance
   made upon its opening. Zukhov curses and shouts orders to his team in
   Russian as the ziggurat begins to shake and crumble further. Stone
   blocks begin falling. They all run toward the entrance of the ziggurat.
   Along the way they join O'Neill's team. Marchenko runs ahead to the
   ziggurat entrance and attempts to stop the descending doorway.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey! Get out of there!

     TOLINEV
     Marchenko!

   [Marchenko is crushed, and the entrance is buried in stone. They are
   left staring at the blocked exit, knowing the man is dead and they are
   trapped.]

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [O'Neill tests the booby trap, but it cannot be reset.]

     DANIEL
     Interesting trap. It doesn't really protect the sarcophagus but it
     does lock you in with it.

     O'NEILL
     I told you to hold your position!

     ZUKHOV
     The mission requires that we thoroughly explore the area.

     O'NEILL
     I gave you an order!

     ZUKHOV
     Someone would have set off the trap eventually. It is just as well.

     O'NEILL
     One of your own men is dead! Where I come from, that tends to make a
     commander just a little upset!

     ZUKHOV
     Where I come from, casualties are to be expected.

     O'NEILL
     What?!

     CARTER
     Colonel, we still need to find a way out of here.

     DANIEL
     Shouldn't we open this first, make sure there's no one home?

     CARTER
     Teal'c, have you ever seen anything like this?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed I have not.

     CARTER
     It's like someone tried to seal the sarcophagus from the outside.

     DANIEL
     Kirensky's team must have cut it open with a blowtorch.

     O'NEILL
     Open it up.

   [Daniel tries.]

     DANIEL
     There's no crystal. There's no button to open it.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for crying out loud. I'll do it myself.

   [He sticks a knife in the opening and levers enough space for fingers.]

     O'NEILL
     Pull.

   [They pull it open, and Carter has her gun ready to fire. Inside they
   find a skeleton in typical Goa'uld finery, though it's now rotted from
   age.]

     O'NEILL
     So much for Marduk.

     ZUKHOV
     I thought a sarcophagus could keep one alive indefinitely.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps it malfunctioned.

     CARTER
     Yeah, but I don't think that's what killed him. These bones exhibit
     the same markings as the skeleton we found. Whatever killed the
     Russian soldier killed the Goa'uld as well.

     O'NEILL
     How'd it get in there?

     CARTER
     I don't know.

     DANIEL
     Better question is, where is it now?

   INT--A ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAY

   [In one passage, we see a cocoon up high on the wall, with something
   moving inside. The cocoon rips open and legs protrude.]

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

     CARTER
     Sir, we've got a problem.

     O'NEILL
     We've got a lot of problems, Carter. Can you be a little more
     specific?

     CARTER
     We can stretch out our food rations, but our water's limited to five
     days.

     O'NEILL
     We won't be here that long.

     TOLINEV
     So now what do we do?

     VALLARIN
     We can use plastic explosive to blast a hole in the entrance.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. That might work. It might also bury us under a ton of
     ziggurat.

     ZUKHOV
     The Colonel is right, Major. The time has not yet come for such
     desperate measures.

     O'NEILL
     What about this writing? Any mention of a back door?

     DANIEL
     No. This portion of the text deals with the final fate of Marduk.

     O'NEILL
     I think we know the final fate of Marduk.

     DANIEL
     Well, apparently, he was such an evil tyrant that his own priests
     rebelled against him. They sealed him in the sarcophagus and placed
     some thing in there with him. There's no direct translation for the
     word, but I'm assuming it's a reference to the creature that ate
     him.

     CARTER
     Are you saying he was eaten alive?

     DANIEL
     The sarcophagus would have done its best to continually keep him
     alive, so... it probably would have taken a while.

     TOLINEV

     (In Russian)
     My God.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, that's officially the worst way to go.

     TEAL'C
     It would seem his fate is very well-deserved.

     DANIEL
     Marduk would have died eventually but the creature must have stayed
     alive in the sarcophagus until Major Kirensky and his men came
     along.

     CARTER
     They let it out; it killed them.

     ZUKHOV
     We've only found one body.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Here's the deal. We're gonna search this place top to
     bottom. We're looking for a way out and the rest of Kirensky's team.
     Everybody got that?

     DANIEL
     I'd like to stay and finish this translation. It might be useful.

     O'NEILL
     Fine. The rest of us will pair off. Teal'c, you're with Zukhov,
     Carter with Tolinev, Major, you're with me.

     VALLARIN
     Yes, sir.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

   [Zukhov and Teal'c check out one passage.]

   [Carter and Tolinev check out another passage.]

     CARTER
     Hold it. Got something.

     TOLINEV
     What is it?

     CARTER
     It looks like some sort of cocoon. It's empty.

   [The creature runs along the wall behind Tolinev.]

     CARTER
     What is it?

     TOLINEV
     I thought I heard something.

   INT--BRITSKI ROOM

   [Zukhov and Teal'c find a chamber filled with debris and skeletons.
   Zukhov goes to one.]

     ZUKHOV
     It's Britski.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS/INT--BRITSKI ROOM

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Go ahead.

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Zukhov and I have found additional skeletal remains, along
     with equipment and personal items.

     O'NEILL
     Any sign of a creature?

     TEAL'C
     Negative.

     ZUKHOV
     Colonel O'Neill, this is Zukhov. I have what appears to be Britski's
     personal log.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Take it back to Daniel. Have him take a look at it.

     ZUKHOV
     Very well.

   [Zukhov takes the Eye of Tiamat out of Britski's pack and hides it on
   his person when Teal'c leaves the room.]

     TEAL'C

     (off-screen)
     Colonel Zukhov!

     ZUKHOV
     Coming!

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

     TOLINEV
     There it is again.

     CARTER
     I don't see anything.

     TOLINEV
     It's around here somewhere.

   [The creature attacks. Elsewhere in the ziggurat passageways, the men
   hear gunfire.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, report.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

     DANIEL
     It's not me.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

     O'NEILL
     Carter, what's your situation?

   [There is no answer; all of the men--except Daniel--run to find Carter
   and Tolinev. They hear more gunfire. They find that Tolinev is down,
   and Carter is firing away like crazy at something that is no longer in
   sight.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter!

     CARTER
     I'm all right.

     ZUKHOV
     What happened?

     CARTER
     The creature attacked us.

     VALLARIN
     I think she's going into shock.

     O'NEILL
     Get her back to the main chamber. Teal'c.

     CARTER
     Sir, it's still alive.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we'll kill it.

     CARTER
     Sir, that's not what I mean. I sensed a presence.

     O'NEILL
     What are you talking about?

     CARTER
     The symbiote. The Goa'uld symbiote. It's still alive. It's inside
     that thing.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [Tolinev's neck looks bad.]

     CARTER
     The creature must have injected her with some kind of venom. Her
     body's shutting down.

     VALLARIN
     What can we do?

     CARTER
     Well, I've given her a shot of epinephrine. That should buy us some
     time, but if we don't get her back to the SGC soon, she's not gonna
     make it.

     DANIEL
     She's right. The same thing happened to the other team, according to
     Dr. Britski's journal. The creature escaped when they opened the
     sarcophagus. It attacked Major Kirensky. He was dead within two
     hours.

     O'NEILL
     Any mention of what happened to the others?

     DANIEL
     Two people died when a passageway collapsed, and the last entry
     reads, "I'm all alone now. There is no escape. Only one course of
     action remains."

     VALLARIN
     A cyanide pill. They were given to all Russian Stargate personnel.

   [O'Neill grimaces at Zukhov.]

     ZUKHOV
     Colonel, we no longer have a choice. We must use the C4.

     O'NEILL
     We're not done searching yet, Colonel.

     ZUKHOV
     Lieutenant Tolinev is running out of time.

     O'NEILL
     I'm well aware of that, Colonel, but we're not gonna risk any more
     lives until we've exhausted our options.

     DANIEL
     Hey, take a look at this. It's a sketch of an artifact Dr. Britski
     found inside the sarcophagus. He thought it might be the eye of
     Tiamat.

     O'NEILL
     You guys find anything like this with the journal?

     ZUKHOV
     There was nothing but old equipment and spoiled rations.

     DANIEL
     Then where is it?

     VALLARIN
     Colonel, surely the recovery of this artifact is no longer a
     priority.

     O'NEILL
     It never was a priority. This was supposed to be a rescue mission.

     TEAL'C
     It would appear there is no one left to rescue.

     DANIEL
     Well, I wouldn't say that.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

   [Teal'c and Carter are exploring one passage, and see a spot of blood
   on the ground.]

     CARTER
     Looks like blood.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill. This is Carter.

   [O'Neill and Zukhov are in another area of the ziggurat.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, go ahead.

     CARTER
     Sir, Teal'c and I found traces of blood. I think I may have wounded
     the creature.

     O'NEILL
     Well, won't its snake fix it?

     CARTER
     Depends on how bad the injury is, sir.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Stay sharp.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

     DANIEL
     How is she?

     VALLARIN
     Her pulse is getting weak.

   [Vallarin hears a noise.]

     VALLARIN
     Did you hear that?

     DANIEL
     What?

   [They both hear it now. Vallarin primes his gun and gets up.]

     VALLARIN
     Wait here.

     DANIEL
     Yes. You go down the dark hallway alone, and I'll wait here in a
     dark room alone.

   [Vallarin goes out into hall following the noises.]

   INT--ZIGGURAT DEAD END

     ZUKHOV
     A dead end.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I guess we should have considered taking that left.

     ZUKHOV
     Colonel, we both know there's only one way out of here.

     O'NEILL
     Any blast big enough to put a hole in that door is gonna bring the
     whole thing down on top of us.

     ZUKHOV
     I'm willing to take the chance.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well, I'm not.

     ZUKHOV
     What about Lieutenant Tolinev?

     O'NEILL
     I thought casualties were to be expected.

     ZUKHOV
     It's obvious you're not capable of taking the necessary risks.

     O'NEILL
     No, we take risks. But we don't hand out cyanide pills... and we
     don't leave our people behind.

   INT--ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAYS

   [Slightly behind Carter and out of her line of sight, Teal'c finds a
   used-up glow-stick.]

     CARTER
     Is it just me or have we been down this passageway before?

     TEAL'C

     (Looking at glow-stick)
     Indeed we have.

     CARTER

     (sigh)
     This place is like a maze.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps we should return...

   [Something drops on Carter and falls to the ground as she jumps away.]

     CARTER
     Ah!

   [It's the alien creature.]

     CARTER
     It's not moving. I'm not sensing anything.

     TEAL'C
     Nor am I.

   [Teal'c pokes it in the neck with his gun a few times. Then he cuts the
   neck open with a knife.]

     TEAL'C
     There is no symbiote inside this creature.

     CARTER
     It could have left the body when it realized it couldn't heal the
     wound.

     TEAL'C
     A symbiote would not survive for very long under those
     circumstances.

     CARTER
     Unless it found a new host.

   INT--RUBBLE ROOM

   [Zukhov finds a new room and he and O'Neill go in to investigate. There
   isn't much in there.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Go ahead.

     CARTER
     Sir, we found the creature. It's dead.

     O'NEILL
     That's good news.

     CARTER
     The only problem is the symbiote's no longer inside it.

     O'NEILL
     That's a bit disconcerting.

     CARTER
     Sir, as you know, Teal'c's body is incapable of sustaining a
     symbiote as long as he carries a larval Goa'uld. And he doesn't
     sense the presence of a Goa'uld in me. So... That leaves Daniel,
     Major Vallarin and, well, the two of you, sir.

   [O'Neill and Zukhov instantly bring their guns to bear on each other.]

     O'NEILL
     Drop the weapon.

     ZUKHOV
     I don't think so.

     O'NEILL
     I know it's not me.

     ZUKHOV
     And I know it's not me.

     CARTER
     Colonel, please respond.

     O'NEILL
     Get back to the main chamber. Check on Daniel and Vallarin. I'll see
     you there in a bit.

     CARTER
     Roger that, sir.

     O'NEILL
     I'm not kidding, Zukhov. I'll shoot ya.

     ZUKHOV
     This is beginning to make sense.

     O'NEILL
     Is it?

     ZUKHOV
     If you were the Goa'uld, you might not want to leave until you found
     the Eye of Tiamat. It would explain your reluctance to use
     explosives.

     O'NEILL
     And if you were the Goa'uld, and you'd been stuck in this dump for
     2,000 years, you might not think about anything except getting out
     of here. Which would explain why you're willing to take such an
     insane risk.

     ZUKHOV
     Then it would seem we have a problem.

   INT--A ZIGGURAT PASSAGEWAY

   [Someone goes to a recess in a wall and pushes a button. A stone
   withdraws and a Goa'uld hand device appears in the space behind it. The
   person, who is in military clothing, reaches in and takes the bracelet.
   Pulling it up to his face, we see it is Major Vallarin.]

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [Daniel is still studying the walls in the sarcophagus room when he
   hears footsteps behind him.]

     CARTER
     Daniel.

     DANIEL
     Hey, guys, I just finished translating this section...

   [He turns to find Carter has her gun, and Teal'c has a zat, pointed
   right at him.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa! Hey, what's up?

     TEAL'C
     I do not sense the presence of a Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     Me neither.

     DANIEL
     Well, thank you.

   [They lower their guns.]

     CARTER
     So what were you gonna say?

     DANIEL

     (a bit shaken)
     I was going to say that I just finished translating a section of the
     text. It says that Marduk used to emerge from his temple and appear
     amongst his people riding a beam of white light.

     CARTER
     A ring transporter?

     DANIEL
     Yeah. And there's a good chance it might be right here in this room.

   INT--RUBBLE ROOM

   [Major Vallarin appears in the doorway of the room where O'Neill and
   Zukhov are still having their stand-off.]

     VALLARIN
     Colonel Zukhov?

     ZUKHOV
     In here.

   [Vallarin enters.]

     VALLARIN
     What is this?

     ZUKHOV

     (In Russian)
     I believe O'Neill may be the Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     Don't be an idiot, Zukhov. It could just as well be him.

     VALLARIN

     (Speaking in Marduk's Goa'uld voice)
     Very true, Colonel.

   [He uses the hand device on O'Neill and sends him flying. Zukhov fires,
   but Marduk has Vallarin's body encased in a Goa'uld protection shield.]

     O'NEILL

     (On ground)
     Oh, man.

   [Vallarin advances on Zukhov once he stops firing, after seeing it's
   doing no good. His eyes glow.]

     VALLARIN
     Where is the Eye of Tiamat?

     ZUKHOV
     I don't know what you're talking about.

     VALLARIN
     You forget, Colonel, that I retain all the knowledge of my host, and
     he was well-aware of your secret orders to obtain alien technology.
     You wish to bring the Eye back to your superiors.

     ZUKHOV
     I have no secret orders.

   [Vallarin backhands Zukhov, knocking him down, then advances on him.]

     VALLARIN
     You lie.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [Daniel has found the rings and is clearing them of all the dust and
   dirt.]

     DANIEL
     Yep, it's here.

     CARTER
     We gotta tell the Colonel.

     DANIEL
     No, not until we're sure he's not a Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     Teal'c, what are you doing?

     TEAL'C
     We must find the means by which to engage the rings.

     DANIEL
     Right.

   [Teal'c touches parts of a pylon, and a secret compartment opens,
   revealing the control panel for the rings.]

   INT--RUBBLE ROOM

   [Vallarin picks up the P-90.]

     VALLARIN
     An interesting weapon. It's obviously capable of inflicting severe
     pain, as well as death. Shall I test it on your new friend?

   [He aims at O'Neill.]

     ZUKHOV
     Stop. I have the Eye.

     VALLARIN
     Give it to me, and I will spare you.

     O'NEILL
     What are you doing?

     ZUKHOV
     I'm sorry, Colonel. I was acting under orders.

     O'NEILL
     Don't give it to him. Don't.

     ZUKHOV
     No one else will die because of me.

     VALLARIN
     Give me the Eye.

     ZUKHOV
     Take it!

   [He tosses something to Vallarin, who catches it, but it's not the Eye.
   It's a grenade whose pin has been pulled. It explodes, and the room
   begins to collapse. O'Neill gets out of the way just in time.]

     O'NEILL
     Geez!

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [The entire ziggurat is crumbling ominously again.]

     DANIEL
     What's that?

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill.

   INT--RUBBLE ROOM

   [O'Neill sees the room he just got out of is half-filled with stone
   blocks, all over the area where Vallarin and Zukhov had been. No human
   could have survived that. More blocks begin to fall, and O'Neill pulls
   back farther.]

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I'm okay.

     CARTER
     What happened?

     O'NEILL
     The Goa'uld was in Vallarin. Zukhov just took him out with a
     grenade.

     CARTER
     Sir, we found a ring transporter. Daniel says it'll take us to
     another temple a few miles from here.

     O'NEILL
     All right. I'll be there in a minute.

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

   [O'Neill arrives.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey.

   [Teal'c had been waiting, and comes up close behind him surreptitiously
   with a zat. When he speaks, it startles O'Neill, who hadn't known he
   was there.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not sense the presence of a Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     Well, good. And I'm fine, by the way. Thanks. How's Tolinev?

     DANIEL
     She'll be okay if we get out of here soon. Where's Zukhov?

     O'NEILL
     He didn't make it. One thing left to do here.

   INT--RUBBLE ROOM

   [A hand with a Goa'uld hand device on it comes up out of the stone
   blocks.]

   INT--SARCOPHAGUS ROOM

     O'NEILL
     Right, all set. Let's go.

     VALLARIN
     Colonel O'Neill!

   [Vallarin is coming down the hall to the sarcophagus room. One arm, the
   one that caught the grenade, is gone.]

     VALLARIN
     I will have my revenge.

     O'NEILL
     You know, you guys always say that.

   [Carter uses a remote to activate something. Vallarin looks where she
   pointed. There is a pile of C4 and the Russian equivalent, with a timer
   that has been activated. It's on a fast 10-second countdown. Vallarin
   looks back at the group just as the rings activate. O'Neill waves
   goodbye. The temple explodes.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond, O'Neill, and a Russian Colonel are seated, and Lieutenant
   Tolinev stands before them. The Russian Colonel speaks Russian to the
   Lieutenant. She answers in Russian and salutes, then turns to go, but
   stops and looks at O'Neill.]

     TOLINEV
     Colonel.

   [O'Neill looks up, and she nods at him respectfully. Then she leaves.]

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     Lieutenant Tolinev corroborates your story.

     O'NEILL
     So she was telling the truth.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     She will be debriefed again, of course, once we're back in Moscow,
     where she can speak more freely.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I'm sure you'll be able to get her to say whatever you want.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, this isn't the time.

     O'NEILL
     General, Zukhov's secret orders put us all in jeopardy. I want that
     on the record.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     Your opinion is already a matter of public record, Colonel. So is
     the fact that every member of your team survived, yet only one
     Russian soldier made it back alive. Barely.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, if your people understood the concept of chain of command,
     none of this...

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     No! We are agreed. You were in command. We also know which lives you
     were willing to sacrifice.

     HAMMOND
     We regret the loss of life and offer our condolences to the families
     of your officers.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     And I'm sure you also regret this Eye of Tiamat was buried along
     with Colonel Zukhov, never to be recovered.

     HAMMOND
     Yes, we do.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     Perhaps it is best to admit we both made mistakes, huh?

     O'NEILL
     It would be better if you just admitted you screwed up.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     I will pass that sentiment along, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, please do.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     I'm sure this will have no bearing on our future participation.

     O'NEILL
     I wouldn't count on future participation if I were you.

     RUSSIAN COLONEL
     No? I would.

   FADE OUT
