   FLASHBACK FROM PRETENSE

   [SG-1 walk through the Gate with Narim.]

   INT--SGC

   FLASHBACK FROM ENIGMA

     OMOC
     I am Omoc. Our world is called Tollan. I find it unbelievable that
     anyone so primitive could have deciphered the Gate system.

     O'NEILL
     Did you say primitive?

   FLASHBACK FROM SHADES OF GREY

   INT--TOLLANA COUNCIL CHAMBER

     TRAVELL
     You are, after all, the people who saved us from the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     Well, in that spirit, we'd like to arrange for a trade.

     TRAVELL
     What would you like to trade?

     DANIEL
     Technology.

     TRAVELL

     (voice over following scene)
     You know that is the one thing we can not give you.

   FLASHBACK FROM PRETENSE

   EXT--TOLLANA, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Cover!

   [Death gliders are swooping overhead as people run for cover. An ion
   cannon shoots at the gliders and the Goa'uld mothership.]

   FLASHBACK FROM ENIGMA

     OMOC

     (to Daniel)
     Narim was right about you. Perhaps, in time, we'll meet again.

   END FLASHBACKS

   EXT--TOLLANA, DAY

     NARIM
     Though we should not mourn the passing of our friend Omoc, as much
     as we should celebrate his existence. He helped us through one of
     the greatest challenges in our people's recent history. His efforts
     contributed to the rebirth of our great nation as it stands today.
     He'll always be remembered.

   [Travell walks to a podium. As she passes her hand over it, a flame
   ignites.]

     CARTER

     (to Narim)
     Very nice.

     O'NEILL
     Very intimate.

     NARIM
     Counselor Omar was well aware that he had very few true friends. He
     was not concerned with trivial relationships. In his testament, he
     asked that his memorial be attended only by those whom he respected.

     DANIEL
     Uh, no offence, but what are we doing here?

     NARIM
     He may not have shown you much warmth or affection, but I can tell
     you, Omoc had a great deal of reverence for all of you.

     TRAVELLE
     As do we all. Colonel O'Neill, please know that we have not
     dismissed what you have done over the past few years for the Tollan
     people.

     O'NEILL
     Don't mention it. We appreciate everything you've done for us--too.

     TRAVELL
     If you are referring to our policy of not sharing our technology, I
     think renewing such a discussion would be better suited for another
     time and place.

     O'NEILL
     Really?

     TRAVELL
     The Tollan Curia has recessed for a day of mourning out of respect
     for Omoc. Would you consider returning tomorrow to meet with me?

     O'NEILL
     Sure.

     TRAVELL
     Thank you all for coming today. I look forward to seeing you again
     soon, Colonel. Narim, will you show our guests to the Stargate?

   [SG-1 follow Narim, as Travell walks away towards a group of men. They
   nod, then leave.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Narim)
     Any idea what she was talking about back there?

     NARIM
     I was as surprised as you by her invitation.

     TEAL'C
     The Chancellor seems to suggest the Tollan Curia may now be willing
     to share its technology.

     NARIM
     I would seriously doubt that. She merely said they would be willing
     to discuss it with you.

     DANIEL
     You think she'd invite us back here if things were status quo?

     NARIM
     I am not on the Curia. I really have no idea what she wishes to see
     you about.

   [The Gate opens.]

     NARIM
     Have a safe trip home.

   [Carter waits behind a little as the men move toward the Stargate.]

     NARIM

     Samantha?
     (he takes her hand)
     I hope I will have a chance to see you upon your return.

   [Carter looks down at their hands, before looking up at Narim. He
   shakes his head slightly. She releases his hand, closing her fingers
   over the device that he has passed to her. Carter walks through the
   Gate and down the ramp, removing her hat.]

     CARTER

     Sir?
     (o'Neill turns towards her.)
     Narim just handed me this.

   [Carter opens her hand. A hologram of Narim comes from the device.]

     NARIM
     Samantha, I'm sorry I was unable to tell you this in person. I do
     not know who I can trust. Before his death, Omoc gave me a warning,
     and I believe it to be true. Earth is in grave danger.

   END OF TEASER--OPENING CREDITS

   SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Narim gave you no other indication that something might be wrong?

     CARTER
     No, Sir. Everything was fine.

     O'NEILL
     For a funeral.

     DANIEL
     You have to admit, it was strange there were so few people there.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, you knew him--what's strange?

     CARTER
     Whatever he meant, I'd be willing to bet that Omoc's warning has
     something to do with what Travell wants to meet with us about.

     HAMMOND
     Agreed. Let's see what they have to say.

   EXTEXT--TOLLANAmdash;TOLLANA, DAY

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     O'NEILL
     Cozy.

   [Travell enters.]

     TRAVELL
     Colonel O'Neill, Doctor Jackson--thank you so much for returning.

     O'NEILL
     Well, thanks for having us.

     TRAVELL
     Are Major Carter and Teal'c not with you?

     DANIEL
     They wanted to spend some time catching up with Narim.

     TRAVELL
     Of course. Shall we get down to business. The Curia met this morning
     as I indicated, and the topic was our policy of sharing technology
     with Earth. In an odd way, Colonel O'Neill, the unfortunate death of
     Omoc has proven to be advantageous for you.

     O'NEILL
     Well, then I guess I'm both sad, and happy.

     TRAVELLE
     You've often expressed a strong interest in obtaining some of our
     technology.

     O'NEILL
     You could say.

     TRAVELL
     In the past, the prevailing beliefs of the Curia have made any such
     arrangements impossible.

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry. What does this have to do with Omoc's death?

     TRAVELL
     Some members of the Curia have been slowly changing their point of
     view about our isolationist ways. Recently, the balance of the votes
     on these issues have been split. Omoc strongly supported the old
     ways.

     DANIEL
     So with his passing, those in favour now control the vote?

     TRAVELL
     We would like to propose an exchange.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, the sound of the other shoe...

     TRAVELL
     Please, Colonel. Have you ever known any political body to act
     solely without concern for its own needs?

     O'NEILL
     What do you want?

     TRAVELL
     We originally chose this planet for our new home because of its
     natural supply of Trinium. However, our nation has grown much
     quicker than anyone anticipated. And the resources are becoming
     depleted.

     DANIEL
     Always a good reason to reassess your isolationist ways.

     TRAVELLE
     As I said, Doctor Jackson, politics have common threads where ever
     you go.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, so you need Trinium. Why not go get some?

   [Travell walks away from them.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     What'd I say?

     DANIEL
     I don't know.

   [Travell gets up on the podium and lowers the lights.]

     TRAVELL
     I have temporarily deactivated security in this room. Normally,
     everything is recorded, and I wish to speak confidentially without
     repercussions.

     O'NEILL
     Off the record?

     TRAVELL
     Yes. The truth is, Colonel, those Councillors that oppose this
     arrangement still have strong voices among our people.

     O'NEILL
     So, the whole Trinium thing is just an excuse to save face publicly?

     TRAVELLE
     We do need it. But as you suggested, we can get it elsewhere if
     necessary.

     DANIEL
     How much do you need?

     TRAVELL
     Would you repeat that?

   [The lights come back on.]

     DANIEL

     (louder)
     How much do you need?

     TRAVELL
     Our scientists will work out the specifics, but given that you now
     have an offworld Trinium mine, I am sure it's within your
     capabilities.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, uh--in exchange, we get...?

     TRAVELL
     A Tollan ion cannon.

     O'NEILL
     One of those big, honking, space guns that shoots Goa'uld ships out
     of the sky?

     TRAVELL
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Cool.

   EXTEXT--TOLLANAmdash;TOLLANA, DAY

   [Carter and Teal'c are sitting on a bench looking at the water.]

     TEAL'C
     I have observed that Narim appears to have strong personal feelings
     for you.

     CARTER
     I know. It's just that...

     NARIM

     (joining Carter and Teal'c)
     Forgive me, Samantha, Teal'c. My duties did not allow me to get away
     before now.

     CARTER
     It's okay. You all right?

     NARIM
     Yes, I'm fine.

     CARTER
     You look concerned.

     NARIM

     (motions for them to walk)
     I apologise for having to send that message the way I did. There
     were so many extra security forces around yesterday, I really didn't
     know who I could trust--except you, of course.

     CARTER
     It's okay. Thank you.

     TEAL'C
     Did Omoc not say any more about the danger to the Tau'ri?

     NARIM
     All I know is what it said in the message. Omoc seemed to be under
     great strain recently.

     CARTER
     Which may explain why he had the heart attack.

   [O'Neill and Daniel come down the steps to join the others.]

     NARIM
     Colonel O'Neill, Doctor Jackson.

     CARTER
     What did Chancellor Travell say?

     O'NEILL
     She offered us an ion cannon.

     NARIM
     I don't believe it!

     O'NEILL
     Neither did we.

     DANIEL
     In exchange for some Trinium.

     NARIM
     That's impossible! The Curia would never agree to that.

     DANIEL
     Well, apparently, Omoc was the swing vote.

     NARIM
     But it goes against everything we've stood for!

     CARTER
     Do you think this is what Omoc was so worried about?

     NARIM
     Of course, it must have been. As you know, another world once
     destroyed themselves because we shared our technology with them.
     That's why we have so strongly resisted sharing what we know with
     more primitive societies.

     O'NEILL
     You know, we prefer "less advanced" if you don't mind.

     NARIM
     My apologies. You know what I meant. If used the wrong way, this ion
     cannon could lead you to disaster.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [A picture of an ion cannon is projected onto the screen.]

     CARTER
     The ion beam technology is very advanced. Unfortunately, it's so
     advanced that backward engineering one of these things for mass
     production is well beyond us. And that poses a bigger problem.

     HAMMOND
     How so?

     CARTER
     Well, Sir. Even strategically placed in, say, Washington DC, one ion
     cannon provides very little range of defence coverage for a planet
     the size of Earth. Even if we could mobilise it, a fleet of Goa'uld
     mother ship could still easily strike at will.

     DANIEL
     Not to mention the fact that the Russians might take issue with our
     having control of a single ion cannon.

     HAMMOND
     Our current relationship with them in these matters is tenuous at
     best.

     CARTER
     So, at this point, one ion cannon is likely to cause more harm than
     good.

     HAMMOND
     How many do we need to set up a proper protective net around the
     entire planet?

     CARTER
     Thirty-eight. Minimum.

     O'NEILL

     DANIEL
     (together)
     Thirty-eight?

     CARTER
     To provide total global coverage? Yes, Sir. And that's not including
     back-ups.

     O'NEILL
     Couldn't hurt to ask, Sir.

     CARTER
     Sir, I feel obligated at this point to mention the fact that Narim
     is opposed to this exchange and thinks that Omoc's warning is
     directly related.

     HAMMOND
     You believe the Tollan Council has ulterior motives that do not
     represent our best interests?

     O'NEILL
     Something's going on--I just don't know what.

     HAMMOND
     I'm ordering you to proceed with the negotiations.

     O'NEILL

     (getting up)
     Okay.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, under the circumstances...

     O'NEILL
     If you are going to recommend that I continue to be suspicious and
     skeptical...

     HAMMOND
     I wouldn't waste my time.

     O'NEILL
     Good thinking, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Just remember this deal could change the course of our history.

     O'NEILL
     So--don't blow it?

     HAMMOND
     What you're sensing as trouble could be simple internal political
     wrangling.

     O'NEILL
     I understand that.

     HAMMOND
     Or we could be walking into a minefield.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Sir. These little chats of ours always bring me great joy
     and serve to ease my mind.

   EXTEXT--TOLLANAmdash;TOLLANA, DAY

   [Narim is walking, looking worried.]

     NARIM

     (to SG-1)
     Greetings.
     (to men escorting the team)
     Chancellor Travell has asked that I personally escort them the rest
     of the way.

     O'NEILL
     Is that true?

     NARIM
     No. I heard you had arrived back on Tollana to meet with Chancellor
     Travell again.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Uh--we're going to ask for a whole whack of space guns.

     NARIM
     This is much worse than I thought.

     CARTER
     Narim, we understand why you're concerned, but those ion cannons
     could save Earth one day.

     DANIEL
     You're just going to have to trust our people won't blow each other
     up with them.

     O'NEILL
     And if we do, we won't blame you, promise.

     NARIM
     You don't understand. Every Tollan has a small implant that monitors
     their health.

   Narim puts a device on his wrist. It bleeps.]

     NARIM
     See? This is my current health data.

     CARTER
     I'm assuming you're okay?

     NARIM
     Yes, perfect health. However, I am overseer of Omoc's personal
     property including this device which contains his health records.
     After our last conversation, I decided to do some checking. As you
     know, Omoc died of a heart attack.

     O'NEILL
     Narim--where are you going with this?

     NARIM

     Despite the fact that...
     (he pauses as some Tollan walk past.)
     Despite the fact that Omoc looked as if he was under great stress,
     he, too, was in perfect health.

     CARTER
     Well, people sometimes die of heart attacks without warning.

     NARIM
     Our implants are linked to a central system. If anything goes wrong,
     health officers are dispatched immediately. Now, normally, maximum
     response time is under five minutes. The night of Omoc's death, it
     took them over ten minutes.

     CARTER
     What are you saying?

     NARIM
     That just doesn't happen. The system is flawless.

     O'NEILL
     No. What are you saying?

     NARIM

     Well, I believe...
     (pauses, looks around.)
     I believe Omoc may have been murdered.

   INT--A MEETING ROOM ON TOLLANA

     DANIEL

     (to Travell, who is looking at a block of trinium)
     Mind if I ask what you need Trinium for?

     TRAVELL
     Trinum is combined with a number of elements to create a compound
     that is used in various Tollan technologies.

     O'NEILL
     Do you people practise being vague?

     TRAVELL
     I will have this sample analysed for purity. Then I will be able to
     give you the amounts we require for our exchange.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah--about that.

     TRAVELL
     Have you reconsidered?

     O'NEILL
     No--No, no. We just don't feel one cannon is going to work.

     DANIEL
     You see, one just doesn't go so far in protecting the entire planet.

     TRAVELL
     Yes, that was discussed by the Curia.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we've come up with a solution you may not have considered.

     TRAVELL
     Yes?

     O'NEILL
     Give us more than...

     O'NEILL

     DANIEL
     (together)
     One.

     TRAVELL
     How many would you require?

     DANIEL

     (hesitently)
     Mmmmm--thirty...

     O'NEILL
     ...eight.

     DANIEL
     Thirty-eight. Total.

     TRAVELL
     I see. Well, I understand your dilemma. Please, give me some time to
     present your request to the Curia.

     O'NEILL
     That went--well.

     Greeting, Narim. Welcome home. Atmospheric control is active. Shall
     I prepare a mid day meal for you and your guests?

     NARIM
     No, thank you.

     CARTER
     Narim?

     NARIM
     Yes, Samantha?

     CARTER
     Is that my voice?

     NARIM
     I'm sorry. I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill asked us to find proof of Omoc's murder. Should we
     not begin?

     NARIM
     I really do not know where to start. The fact is there hasn't been a
     murder among the Tollan for as long as I can remember.

     TEAL'C
     Is crime so uncommon here?

     NARIM
     There are occasional crimes of indiscretion which are duly punished,
     but nothing even approaching the severity of murder. Our security
     systems prevent it, which is why I was so reluctant to even suggest
     it.

     CARTER
     This doesn't make any sense. Sure, the Curia disagreed with Omoc
     over whether or not to give us your weapons, but do you really think
     they would kill him over it?

     NARIM

     I don't know what to believe anymore, Samantha.
     (to Teal'c.)
     The records of all Curia meetings are public. We can read through
     them right here.

   [Narim walks to a computer device in the wall.]

     TEAL'C
     There appears to be much information.

     NARIM
     Yes. But as Samantha suggested maybe there is something in all this
     that will indicate the seriousness of the conflict between Omoc and
     the other members.

     CARTER
     Can you translate it for us?

   EXTEXT--TOLLANAmdash;TOLLANA, DAY

     You think Narim's right about Omoc?

     O'NEILL
     I think this thing smells worse and worse by the minute.

     DANIEL
     Are you still willing to proceed?

     O'NEILL
     Well, I think it's the only way we're going to find out what's
     really going on.

     DANIEL
     The question is, how far do we go?

     O'NEILL
     Well, all we know is that these people might be willing to part with
     some very powerful weapons. I have No problem with that.

     DANIEL
     Oh--no surprise there.

     O'NEILL
     At worse, some people disagree on some philosophical level that I
     don't even care to understand.

     DANIEL
     Actually, worst, they killed someone to make sure this would happen.

     O'NEILL
     Now, see? That makes no sense to me.

     DANIEL
     Exactly. So, we push on blindly, then.

     O'NEILL
     Blindly, yes. But we still have our slightly heightened sense of
     smell.

     Isn't there some way to narrow this down? Search the records for
     specific topics?

     CARTER'S VOICE
     Please indicate the topic of interest.

     CARTER
     Okay, how do we shut that off?

     NARIM

     O'NEILL
     You sure this is the right spot?

     The directions he gave said here.

     O'NEILL
     How do know this is Narim's house? They all look the same here.

   [Narim opens the door.]

     Cause that's Narim.

     You're good.

     NARIM
     Come in.

     Whatcha reading' there fella?

     TEAL'C
     Tollan Curia records.

     O'NEILL
     Don't wreck it for me.

     What did Travell say?

     O'NEILL
     We got the guns.

     NARIM
     That cannot be true.

     CARTER
     All of them?

     DANIEL
     Over time as we deliver the Trinium.

     CARTER
     Wow!

     O'NEILL
     What do you guys got?

     CARTER
     Uh, well, so far, not much.

     TEAL'C
     Narim, Colonel O'Neill. This says that two months ago, there was an
     unscheduled test of Tollan ion cannons. And that Omoc filed an
     official protest.

     NARIM
     Yes. I remember it well. We were supposed to have an evening meal
     together. Omoc was late. He was very angry when he arrived. He spent
     the entire time ranting about the unfairness of random testing on
     the Tollan people.

     DANIEL
     I don't understand. Why is this important?

     CARTER
     Well, we're looking for indications of Omoc's difference of opinion
     with the Curia.

     NARIM
     This can't be!

     O'NEILL
     What?

     NARIM
     According to this record, the Curia meeting adjourned in the late
     afternoon. Omoc came here straight from the meeting, I'm sure it was
     well into the evening.

     CARTER
     So?

     NARIM
     It means there are at least two hours of notations missing from
     these records.

     O'NEILL
     A slight omission?

     NARIM
     That's not possible.

     CARTER
     Narim, if the Curia can commit murder, they can certainly erase a
     couple of hours from the public record.

     NARIM
     You don't understand our laws. For the highest members of our
     government to deceive the people--as strange as it may sound, it's
     an even more heinous crime than murder, it's, it's unthinkable. At
     the time, I thought it was strange that Omoc would be so upset over
     an ion cannon test.

     O'NEILL
     So, there's slightly more to it than that, eh?

     DANIEL
     If the Curia wanted to cover up details of this incident, why leave
     Omoc's protests on record?

     NARIM
     Because an official protest of Tollan policy is filed with every
     level of every branch of the government. It would be impossible to
     erase it without a conspiracy of massive proportions reaching far
     outside the Curia.

     CARTER
     So, whatever happened in the time missing from these records, it
     could be why Omoc was killed.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND
     As far as what you told me, there seems to be an evil conspiracy
     among the Tollan Curia, whose apparent goal is to give us everything
     we ever wanted. That makes no sense.

     O'NEILL
     I said that.

     TEAL'C
     Unless the Tollan can not procure Trinium on their own as easily as
     they claim.

     DANIEL
     Travell did go to great lengths to convince us it was just a
     face-saving exercise to appease the nay-sayers.

     HAMMOND
     Do we have any idea what the Tollans are going to do with the
     Trinium?

     O'NEILL
     Lots and lots of very interesting and unspecific things.

     CARTER
     Sir, we could try tagging the first shipment, see where it goes.

     HAMMOND
     How?

     CARTER
     Well, we introduce a barely detectable radioactive isotope. If the
     Tollans catch it and enquire, we say it's a by-product of the
     purification process, and we've been unable to eliminate it
     entirely.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

   INT--NARIM'S HOUSE

   [Carter is looking at a monitor.]

     NARIM
     And Travell doesn't suspect you?

     O'NEILL
     If she does, she's not letting on.

     DANIEL
     We're the primitive, inferior race, why would she suspect us?

     CARTER
     The Trinium's still moving. Right now it's two clicks
     south-southwest of here.

     NARIM
     Do you realise what you have done by involving me in this? Just
     knowing what you've done...

     O'NEILL
     Hey! You involved yourself in this when you sent us that warning.

     NARIM
     Warning you that your world is in danger is not the same as
     committing treason against my own government.

     DANIEL
     If your leaders are involved in something untoward and they
     committed murder to cover it up, what you're doing is not treason.

     NARIM
     What I am doing is nothing.

     O'NEILL
     Then help us.

     NARIM
     How?

     CARTER
     Tell us how to get into Travell's office and access her computer.

     NARIM
     What?

     DANIEL
     If there is a conspiracy, she's in on it.

     TEAL'C
     It was in fact Travell that offered us the ion cannons.

     NARIM
     It's impossible! There's no way.

     O'NEILL
     Narim, will you get your head out of your ass? You started this!

     DANIEL
     Your government is deceiving its people. You said yourself, that's
     the most heinous crime you can think of.

     NARIM
     I should have reported this to the security office long ago.

     CARTER
     But you can't because the Curia ultimately have more power.

     TEAL'C
     As a citizen, is it not your duty to investigate such a crime?

     NARIM
     The security systems prevent...

     DANIEL
     Travell was able to turn them off in her office.

     NARIM
     Why would she do that?

     O'NEILL
     So she could talk to us off the record.

     NARIM
     That is a severe violation of the governmental conduct code.

     O'NEILL
     Gee, what a shock!

     NARIM
     There is one chance. Only the highest ranking members of the Curia
     would have access codes to the security system in the building where
     Travell's office is located. Omoc was among them.

     CARTER
     And you have his personal effects?

     NARIM
     His code would be in the data device if it is not deactivated.

     O'NEILL

     Okay. Daniel, Carter. go with Narim. Check out Travell's office. See
     what you come up with. Teal'c and I'll track the Trinium.
     (to Narim)
     Um, that's the thing that lets you go through walls, right?

     NARIM
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Got a couple extra layin' around?

     NARIM
     That would be a violation of...

     O'NEILL
     Good! How about weapons?

     NARIM
     Colonel O'Neill...

     O'NEILL
     Just in case.

     NARIM
     You know our security sensors disable...

     TEAL'C
     The weapons carried by your security forces remain unaffected.

   INT--A HALLWAY OUTSIDE TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     NARIM
     If this doesn't work, security will be here in seconds.

   [Narim enters a code into a wall device. The door opens and they
   enter.]

     DANIEL
     Way to go, Omoc!

     NARIM

     (at console)
     Here. This is a private communication sent to our chief of science
     and technology just after the meeting.

     CARTER
     There was no random ion cannon test.

     NARIM
     It says a Goa'uld ship entered orbit, and that the ion cannons fired
     in defense.

     DANIEL
     "Ineffectively?"

     NARIM
     I don't see how that could be! Our ion cannons have always been
     successful against Goa'uld mother ships.

     CARTER
     Maybe this Goa'uld has developed shields that defend against them.

     NARIM
     That would be catastrophic. We have no other weapons capable of
     defending...

     CARTER
     Wait a second--this makes no sense. It says, "Despite resisting your
     attack, the ship left peacefully."

     DANIEL
     Yeah, right.

     CARTER
     Why would a Goa'uld mother ship impervious to your ion cannons just
     leave?

     NARIM
     There must be more.

   [He checks the records.]

     NARIM
     No other records of communications mentions a Goa'uld ship.

     DANIEL
     It must have been discussed off the record after that.

     CARTER
     Well, we know the ion cannons are useless if they won't defend
     against Goa'uld mother ships anymore.

     DANIEL
     Which explains why Travell was willing to give us as many as we
     wanted.

     CARTER
     Let's see if we can find out what the Trinium's being used for.

   INT--A TOLLAN BUILDING

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter the building and walk down a corridor. They
   stop at a door.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, looks like our Trinium is in here.

     TEAL'C

     (he holds up his arm)
     Narim said for the device to work on both of us, we must hold hands,
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     (after a nervous pause.)
     I know.

   [O'Neill takes Teal'c'shand. They interlock their fingers and walk
   through the wall together. O'Neill pulls his hand away. They walk over
   to some sort of weapon.]

     TEAL'C
     This is unlike any Tollan device I have previously seen.

     O'NEILL
     Well, whatever it is, they seem to think they're going to need a lot
     of them.

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

   [Narim is looking at a screen which is showing an explosion.]

     CARTER
     Whoa!

     NARIM
     It's a weapon of mass destruction.

   [On the screen, a weapon is seen spinning round.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, where does the Trinium come in?

     NARIM
     Trinium is required to house any device that generates our phase
     shift technology.

     DANIEL
     Are you saying this bomb is being made so it can go through
     anything?

     NARIM
     Theoretically, yes. Of course, that must be it. This weapon is
     intended to replace the ion cannon in defence of our planet.

     CARTER
     Sorry, Narim. That just doesn't add up. A Goa'uld would never drop
     by just so you could check out his new shield technology and then go
     away to give your people time to build a weapon to penetrate it.

     NARIM
     What else could have possibly happened?

   [Travell enters, accompanied by a number of security officers.]

     TRAVELL
     Please, lower your weapons. The building is full of security.

   [The guards disarm Carter and Daniel.]

     TRAVELL
     What do you think you're doing, Narim?

     NARIM
     What do you think you are doing, Chancellor?

   [Travell looks past Narim to Tanith.]

     TANITH
     She is doing what she must to preserve your world.

   INT--NARIM'S HOUSE

   [O'Neill enters, to be met by security guards holding weapons.]

     O'NEILL
     Hello, fellas.

   [One of the guards is shot by a laser beam, while O'Neill shoots the
   other.]

     O'NEILL
     This is not a good sign.

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     NARIM
     You are in league with a Goa'uld!

     CARTER
     His name is Tanith.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, aren't you supposed to be dead?

     TANITH
     If you must know...

     DANIEL
     I must.

     TANITH

     I had left Apophis's ship in an escape pod long before the sun
     exploded.
     (to Carter)
     Thank you, by the way. In destroying his fleet, you did me a great
     favour.

     CARTER
     It was nothing.

     TANITH
     How lovely it is to see you both here. I assume Teal'c must be
     around here somewhere.

     TRAVELL
     The others are being apprehended as we speak.

     TANITH
     I am so looking forward to seeing him and Colonel O'Neill again.

     NARIM

     (to Travell)
     How could you do this?

     TRAVELL
     I have done nothing alone, Narim. The Curia is acting in the
     interest of Tollana.

     NARIM
     You murdered Omoc!

     TRAVELL
     Had we not done what we did, there would be no Tollana to speak of.

     TANITH
     And there won't be if you do not fullfil your promise, Chancellor.

     TRAVELL
     Rest assured, we will deliver as promised.

     NARIM
     You and the Curia are not in power to make such deals on behalf of
     the Tollan people. We would rather fight and die than trade our
     technology to the Goa'uld.

     TRAVELL
     I wonder if you would you be so quick to make that decision were you
     in my position.

   [Narim and Carter exchange a look. Carter indicates the device on his
   arm and signals silently to Narim. He uses the device to create a
   diversion and he, Carter and Daniel start to run. Tanith catches Carter
   and Daniel in his ribbon device, sending them crashing against the
   wall. Narim escapes by jumping through the wall.]

     TRAVELL
     After him! He will not get away!

   EXT--TOLLANA, NEAR NARIM'S HOME, DAY

   [Narim walks down some stairs, then along a path near his home. Teal'c
   grabs him.]

     NARIM
     How did you find me?

     O'NEILL
     You're the one wearing grey.

     TEAL'C
     DanielJackson and MajorCarter?

     NARIM
     We were caught by Travell and the Goa'uld the Curia have entered
     into a bargain with. I managed to escape with this.

   [He holds his arm up to show the device.]

     NARIM
     But the entire security force of Tollana must be looking for me--and
     you for that matter.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, back up to that Goa'uld bargain part.

     NARIM
     The Tollan Curia have made a deal with a Goa'uld. His name is
     Tanith.

   [Teal'c reacts to the name.]

     O'NEILL
     Easy, big fella. What kind of deal?

     NARIM
     This Goa'uld's mothership has a new kind of shield which is
     impervious to our ion cannons. For the first time, Tollana is
     vulnerable to attack.

     O'NEILL
     There hasn't been an attack.

     NARIM
     No, to prevent our destruction, the Curia has agreed to build
     weapons for the Goa'uld.

     TEAL'C
     We have seen these weapons. There are a great many.

     O'NEILL
     What exactly can they do?

     NARIM
     They are explosives of great power that utilise the Tollan
     phase-shift technology. They will be able to penetrate any solid
     matter prior to detonation.

     O'NEILL
     Like--an iris?

     NARIM
     As you've witnessed before, I've used our technology to walk right
     through the barrier that protects your planet's Stargate.

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     GUARD

     (to Travelle)
     We've been unable to locate them thus far. Our efforts continue.

     TRAVELL
     Use Narim's health implant to locate him.

     GUARD
     But that would be in violation of...

     TRAVELL

     Do it!
     (to Tanith)
     Tell your master we will make the delivery on schedule.

     CARTER
     Excuse me--your master?

     DANIEL
     Well, you don't think he could do all this by himself, do you?

     CARTER
     Apophis dead, fresh out of an escape pod--of course he would have to
     ally himself with someone more powerful wouldn't he?

     DANIEL
     So, who are you taking orders from now?

     TRAVELL
     Apparently the one he serves has no name.

     TANITH
     Oh, he has a name. The likes of you are simply forbidden to know it.
     Do with them as you wish. However, if your pathetic security forces
     finally manage to capture Teal'c have him transported up to me.

   EXT--NEAR NARIM'S HOME

     TEAL'C
     We must not allow Tanith to possess these weapons.

     O'NEILL
     I know.

     NARIM
     What can we do?

     O'NEILL
     Destroy them.

     NARIM
     How?

     O'NEILL
     You tell me.

     NARIM
     Travelle is right. It's not so easy when the fate of your planet is
     in your own hands.

     O'NEILL
     Narim...

     NARIM
     Look, the Goa'uld will attack Tollana if the delivery is not made.
     You are asking me to destroy my own world.

     O'NEILL
     I am asking you not to destroy Earth and God knows how many other
     planets to save your own ass. I'm asking you to do the right thing,
     and you know it.

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     TANITH

     (on screen)
     Your time is up, Chancellor.

     TRAVELL
     We are ready to make the first delivery.

     TANITH
     Very well. However, before accepting, we will first require a
     demonstration of the technology to ensure that it works as expected.

     TRAVELL
     I assure you, it has been tested and each weapon is fully...

     TANITH
     You will activate one of these weapons and sent it through your
     Stargate to the Tau'ri. You have thirty minutes.

   INT--THE WEAPONS ROOM

   [O'Neill and Teal'c go to one of the weapons.]

     O'NEILL
     You got any idea what you're doing?

   [A sound of the bomb activating is heard.]

     TEAL'C
     None.

   [A number of guards enter pointing weapons. O'Neill smiles and puts his
   hands up in surrender.]

     O'NEILL
     Good enough.

   INT--TRAVELL'S OFFICE

     DANIEL

     (to Travell)
     You know exactly why you were building these devices and what they
     would be used for.

     CARTER
     You just didn't expect them to make you pull the trigger.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld have no choice. Earth is a protected planet. They can't
     do it themselves without having to deal with the Asgard.

     TRAVELL
     I had no choice either.

     CARTER
     Yes, you did.

   [The door opens. O'Neill and Teal'c enter, followed by the Tollan
   Guards.]

     O'NEILL
     Hi, kids!

     GUARD
     They were captured attempting to sabotage one of the weapons. They
     had this on them.

     TRAVELL
     Narim's heath implant. What have you done to him?

     O'NEILL
     Nothing. However, while these guys were chasing us...

     TEAL'C
     Narim was able to move freely.

   [On the screen, an ion cannon is shown blasting a building. The room
   shakes.]

     TRAVELL
     Leave them! Come!

     O'NEILL
     Where you guys goin'?

   [O'Neill walks towards the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey!

   [O'Neill touches door and gets an electric shock.]

     O'NEILL
     Ow! Damn!

   [Narim enters by walking through the wall. Carter and Daniel get up.]

     NARIM
     If they haven't already, the Goa'uld will soon realise that we no
     longer intend to honour our end of the bargain.

   [The room shakes from an explosion.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, hey--we should go!

   [They all head for the door.]

   EXT--TOLLANA, DAY

   [People are running everywhere in panic, screaming.]

     NARIM
     You must hurry straight to the Stargate.

     CARTER
     Aren't you coming with us?

     NARIM
     My actions have forced my people to fight a battle we may very well
     lose. The least I can do is stay and fight with them.

     O'NEILL

     (shaking Narim's hand)
     Good luck.

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel start to run from the plaza.]

     CARTER
     I hope this isn't goodbye.

     NARIM
     Go!

   [Carter runs up the stairs. She turns to look at him. He smiles and
   nods to her. Narim is last seen standing in the plaza with buildings
   blowing up behind him.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND

     (looking out the window to the Gate)
     So, we can reasonably assume the Goa'uld did not get any of these
     weapons.

     O'NEILL
     We can only hope.

     HAMMOND
     What about these new shields?

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld do not share technology.

     CARTER
     Well, whoever Tanith is now working for, these new shields give him
     a decided advantage.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c? Any guesses who it might be?

     TEAL'C
     None, General Hammond.

     HAMMOND
     I suppose we have to rest assured that who ever it is, they are
     still afraid of confronting the Asgard or they would have attacked
     Earth themselves.

     DANIEL
     For now.

     DAVIS

     (over intercom)
     Incoming communication!

   [Hammond leads the way down to the control room.]

     DAVIS
     We're getting a direct transmission from a Tollan long range
     communication device.

     NARIM

     (garbled transmission over radio)
     ...To get the people out. The Stargate was destroyed...

     CARTER
     Narim.

     NARIM
     All defenses failing...our ships attempting to escape are being shot
     down...I just want you to know that...

   [The transmission dies into static.]

     DAVIS
     I'm sorry, Sir. That's it. The transmission just died.

   [Carter looks away with tears in her eyes.]
