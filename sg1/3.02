   FADE IN

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The iris covering the Stargate opens and the event horizon shoots out.
   Jacob Carter emerges and walks down the ramp to the waiting SG-1 and
   Hammond.]

     JACOB
     George.

     HAMMOND
     Jacob.

   [They shake hands.]

     JACOB

     Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Daniel. Sam.
     (hugging Carter)
     How you doing, kid?

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     Ok, Dad.

     JACOB
     So, you guys are the talk of the Tok'ra water-cooler.

     O'NEILL
     For what?

     JACOB
     Kicking some major Hathor behind.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, we do take pride in good work. But that's not why you're here.

     JACOB
     No. We need your help.

     CARTER
     You need our help? With what?

     JACOB
     Let's just call it a Goa'uld hunt.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Jacob places on the table a device which emits a small, holographic
   pyramid.]

     DANIEL
     It's fascinating.

     CARTER
     No kidding. A projected hologram with no silver-halide coated
     plates, no photo-polymer film, no...

     DANIEL
     Actually, I was talking about what's being projected. It's like a
     family tree of the ancient Egyptian gods.

     JACOB
     Actually, of the Goa'uld System Lords.

     DANIEL
     Ra, Apophis, Hathor, Heru-ur...

     TEAL'C
     The symbol of Setesh is oscillating.

     DANIEL
     That is the symbol of Setesh.

     JACOB
     Have you met him, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I have met descendants of his Jaffa.

     O'NEILL
     All right, who's this Setesh fella?

     DANIEL
     Otherwise known as Setec, Set, Seti, Seth. Ancient Egyptian god of
     chaos, embodiment of hostility and...outright evil.

     HAMMOND
     Why haven't we heard of him before?

     DANIEL
     Well, I'm guessing we haven't even scratched the surface on meeting
     all the Goa'uld System Lords. There's probably thousands we haven't
     even heard of, right?

     JACOB
     Only dozens at the rank of System Lord. Thousands of Goa'ulds in
     general.

     CARTER
     What makes you think we would have met this one?

     JACOB
     The Tok'ra Council has been taking a Goa'uld census, of sorts. Where
     the System Lords have positioned themselves, what domain they rule,
     who serves under them, that sort of thing. But there's one Goa'uld
     we've lost track of.

     O'NEILL
     Seth?

     JACOB
     Our record of him ends when the Earth's gate was buried in ancient
     Egypt.

     CARTER
     Are you saying he never left?

     JACOB
     That's our theory. We think he still might be here, hiding among
     Earth's people.

   [O'Neill looks thoughtful.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     O'NEILL
     All right, we'll be cutting to the chase on this one. You want us to
     help you find this snake-head, who, if he's here at all, would be
     hiding in one of...six billion people on Earth?

     JACOB
     Yes.

     CARTER
     How do you know he's still alive?

     DANIEL
     He's alive if he has a sarcophagus.

     JACOB
     Or if he changes hosts every four hundred years or so.

     HAMMOND
     But if he were here, why wouldn't he have tried to get at the
     Stargate sometime between when it was buried and now? Or, why
     wouldn't he try to take over the Earth, like Ra did?

     JACOB
     Seth had a hefty price on his head...he tried to overthrow Ra. Now,
     the System Lords wanted him dead, as did the Tok'ra. We believe if
     he's still here, it's because he's using Earth as a place to hide
     out. He wishes to remain hidden among you.

     O'NEILL
     Kinda gives needle in a haystack a whole new meaning.

     JACOB
     Well, I know it's a long shot.

     DANIEL
     Not necessarily. Remember, Setesh is a Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     TEAL'C
     As a Goa'uld, he will never lose his thirst for power.

     DANIEL
     And they do have a pretty common MO for getting that power.

     TEAL'C
     False religion.

     DANIEL
     Which shrinks the proverbial haystack considerably. Let me do some
     homework, see if I can track him through archaeological and
     historical record.

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter is walking along with Jacob.]

     CARTER
     So Dad, you don't really think we have a chance of finding this
     Goa'uld, do you?

     JACOB
     It's the mission Garshaw assigned me.

     CARTER

     You didn't request it?
     (after he doesn't reply)
     Dad?

     JACOB
     Why would I request it, huh?

     CARTER
     Come on, would it be so awful to admit that you just wanted a chance
     to see me?

     JACOB
     Of course not. You're right, that's why I requested it.

     CARTER
     Ok, so that's obviously not the reason. What's going on?

   [As they enter an elevator, Selmak takes control.]

     SELMAK
     It is I who requested the assignment.

     CARTER
     Selmak.

     SELMAK
     Nice to see you once again, Captain Carter.

     CARTER
     Likewise. So, let me ask you the same question.

     SELMAK
     Your father has an unresolved issue here on your planet, and frankly
     it's beginning to irritate me.

     CARTER
     Mark.

     SELMAK
     Yes. Your father's a proud man. He refuses to seek out your brother
     and mend their relationship.

     CARTER
     Yeah, well Mark isn't exactly rushing into my father's arms either.
     Even when we thought Dad was going to die, he wouldn't take my call.

     SELMAK
     It hurt your father deeply when his son didn't come to him on his
     deathbed.

   [Jacob takes back control from Selmak.]

     JACOB
     Now why would it hurt? As far as I was concerned, the kid wasn't my
     son anymore. It didn't hurt a bit.

   [They exit the elevator.]

     CARTER
     Dad, I have a number for Mark in San Diego.

     JACOB
     So?

     CARTER
     I just thought you might want to know.

     JACOB
     When was the last time you saw him?

     CARTER
     I haven't seen him since either of his kids were born. I guess he
     paints me with the same brush as he does you.

     JACOB
     Well, Selmak's pushing me to go mend some fences.

     CARTER
     I guess Selmak is as wise as they say. Look, I'll go with you, when
     do you want to do it?

     JACOB
     No, I didn't say I'd go, I just said Selmak's pushing it.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Jacob and Carter enter Daniel's office.]

     JACOB
     So what's the bad news?

     TEAL'C
     On the contrary, we have good news.

     CARTER
     You do?

     DANIEL
     I did a timeline Boolean search for religion, cult, Set, Setesh,
     Setec, Set...

     O'NEILL

     (interrupting)
     Yadda.

     DANIEL
     ...and here's what I found. It appears there's been a cult of Setesh
     throughout history, in one form or another, since around 1000 BC.

   [Carter, looking at the page displayed on his computer, sees the
   picture of a strange animal.]

     CARTER
     What is that?

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah, that. Well, Setesh was represented by animal that was
     either fictitious or now extinct. Most likely the former, rather
     than the latter, since anthropologists haven't discovered any
     fossils to point to a species like this ever existing.

     TEAL'C
     Because the creature represents Setesh, the helmets of the Setesh
     guard have continued to be a source of many jokes among the Jaffa.

     O'NEILL
     Jaffa jokes? Let's hear one of them.

     TEAL'C
     I shall attempt to translate one, O'Neill. A Serpent Guard, a Horus
     Guard and a Setesh Guard meet on a neutral planet. It is a tense
     moment. The Serpent Guard's eyes glow! The Horus Guard's beak
     glistens! The Setesh Guard's...nose drips.

   [He starts laughing, but stops when none of the others joins in. There
   is a long, awkward moment.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, after Set was supposedly killed in ancient Egypt along with all
     his minions, a similar god showed up in Greece called Typhon.
     Similar back stories and remains, another fictitious animal
     representation. In one of Typhon's last legends, he killed three
     hundred followers and then disappeared from Greece. Now at that
     point, he seemed to vanish from recorded history altogether. Until I
     found this. A new cult arose in England early 1800s, strangely
     enough near the location of Stonehenge. The cult had an enigmatic
     leader named Seth. They were constantly under attack by the
     Christians, then, and this is the important part, Seth's
     worshippers, all of them, were found dead, having slit their own
     throats. But Seth's body was never found.

     O'NEILL
     Guy liked to leave a lot of dead bodies behind.

     CARTER
     Did you lose the scent there?

     DANIEL
     I thought so, until, on a whim, I did a search on the US Government
     classified net, in case the CIA had a record of...something,
     somewhere. And guess what came up on the ATF page? A cult whose
     leader is named Seth, just North of Seattle. The ATF are
     investigating him now because they've become so heavily armed and
     fortified. This guy has about fifty followers, who are all
     apparently ready to die for him.

     JACOB
     You mean to say you actually found this guy?

     CARTER
     How do we know he's our Goa'uld?

   [Daniel starts reading from the report displayed on his computer
   screen.]

     DANIEL
     Deprogrammed ex members of the cult describe Seth as having magical
     powers and the ability to heal. They also claim he's murdered
     several members in front of the others. And here's the best
     part...several independent reports have stated that the cult leader
     can make his own eyes glow.

   [He clicks on the picture accompanying the report, enlarging the photo
   of Seth.]

   EXT--AIRFIELD (DAY)

   [SG-1's plane lands at an airstrip.]

   EXT--SETH'S COMPOUND, PERIMETER FENCE (DAY)

   [SG-1, along with Jacob, drive up to the fenced off entrance to Seth's
   compound. They get out to meet the local Sheriff.]

     SHERIFF
     This is the place. Main building's about three-quarter mile up that
     drive. I sure hope you can shut these guys down. I've had a lot of
     parents come in my office...they've lost their kids to this nut. I
     haven't got the manpower or the, what you call probable cause, that
     you Federal types do.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we'll do what we can, Sheriff, appreciate you letting us look
     around.

     VOICE

     (over Sheriff's radio)
     Sheriff, we got a fire breaking out down at Earl's.

     SHERIFF
     Duty calls. Looks like you don't need me getting in your way now.
     You give me a call if you need me, huh?

     O'NEILL
     Will do.

   [As the Sheriff drives away, a man hurries across the road to meet
   them.]

     MAN
     You people with the FBI?

     O'NEILL
     Nope. Who are you?

     MAN
     Name's Jason Levinson. Been camping out here the past month hoping
     to catch a glimpse of my boy Tommy, at least to know if he's still
     alive. Been in there nine months now. You folks deprogrammers?
     Better be good...guy I hired got shot in the leg trying to get in
     there.

     O'NEILL
     So he's got some armed guards, is what you're saying.

     LEVINSON
     Lot of 'em. And what's that damned small-town Sheriff do about it?
     Nothing. Not a damned thing.

   [He looks at Jacob.]

     LEVINSON
     You're the father, aren't you? Your boy's in there.

     JACOB
     No. You've got that wrong. My son isn't in there.

   [Levinson is obviously unconvinced.]

     LEVINSON

     (to O'Neill)
     Uh-huh. How much would you tack on to get my boy out the same time
     as his?

     O'NEILL
     You help us, we might be able to help you.

     LEVINSON
     I'm with you, sir.

     O'NEILL
     That won't be necessary, but we could use any information you might
     have. What your guy did, where he went in, where he got caught, that
     kind of stuff.

     LEVINSON
     You got it. The fence is in the wide open, and most of the property.
     But I'll show you brush cover...if you want to go in.

   [He starts walking towards the perimeter fence and Daniel and Carter
   follow.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, we are being surveilled.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I saw them. It's probably FBI, maybe ATF.

   [A man, dressed as a telecommunications engineer and standing on a
   raised platform, is watching them through a pair of binoculars.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE SETH'S COMPOUND, WOODS (DAY)

   [O'Neill lights a small charge, which burns through the metal bars of
   the fence.]

     LEVINSON
     You guys are prepared! I'm going with you.

     DANIEL
     I think it will be safer for everyone if you wait for us here.

   [O'Neill breaks away the cut section of the fence and SG-1, along with
   Jacob, enter the woods on the other side. O'Neill signals for them to
   continue forward as Levinson watches. They stop at the edge of the
   woods to survey Seth's compound. O'Neill looks through his binoculars
   at the armed disciples patrolling the compound.]

     O'NEILL
     AK-47s, couple of Uzis. Anyone think they observed the requisite 15
     day waiting period for those weapons?

     CARTER

     (looking through binoculars)
     Sir, their sidearms.

   [The cult members are armed with zats.]

     CARTER
     Think it's safe to say there's a Goa'uld there.

   [Carter spots another weapon.]

     CARTER
     And it looks like a pair of 50 cal.

     O'NEILL
     Does the concept of overkill mean anything to anybody? Let's fall
     back to the RV point.

   [As they reach the fence, they are confronted by a group of armed men
   who have their weapons aimed at SG-1.]

     LEADER
     Lower your weapons.

     O'NEILL
     Was wondering when you folks were going to show. We got bets. I say
     FBI, they say ATF.

     LEADER
     Special Agent James Hamner. ATF.

     O'NEILL
     Damn.

   EXT--ATF BASE CAMP (DAY)

   [SG-1, along with Jacob, are driven into the ATF's camp.]

     HAMNER

     (to Jacob)
     General, want to tell me what interest the Air Force has here?

     O'NEILL
     That would be classified.

     HAMNER
     This way, gentlemen.

   [He leads them inside a large tent, full of equipment.]

     HAMNER
     You guys Special Forces?

     O'NEILL
     Also classified.

     HAMNER
     I was talking to your commanding officer, Colonel.

     JACOB

     (to Hamner)
     He's right. It's classified.

     HAMNER
     I have top level clearance.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, not top enough.

     HAMNER

     (to Jacob)
     You have a rather insubordinate subordinate, General.

     JACOB
     He's not insubordinate to me. Only to people such as yourself. Saves
     me the trouble. Now maybe you can tell us what you and your cohorts
     are planning here.

     HAMNER
     This compound is owned by a cult. It's run by a charming guy, goes
     by the name of Seth Fargough.

     O'NEILL

     (silently to Daniel)
     Fargough?

     HAMNER
     We've recently acquired intelligence to confirm they have a hoard of
     prohibited weaponry here.

     O'NEILL
     That's some mighty fine intelligence you got there.

     JACOB

     (to Hamner)
     So what do you plan to do?

     HAMNER
     Surround the compound, negotiate, try to get them to come out
     peacefully.

     DANIEL
     You have no idea what you're dealing with.

     HAMNER
     And I suppose you do?

     DANIEL
     As a matter of fact...

     HAMNER

     (cutting him off)
     Great, then why don't you tell me?

     O'NEILL
     Ah, that would be classified as well.

     HAMNER
     Fine, I'll tell you what. The United States Air Force has not been
     invited to participate in this operation, therefore you're out of
     your jurisdiction, therefore I'm ordering you all to leave. Or I'll
     have you arrested.

   [Jacob gestures to the telephone.]

     JACOB
     This is a secure phone, isn't it? Can we use it to place one call?

     HAMNER
     Why not?

     JACOB
     Thank you. Colonel?

   [O'Neill picks up the telephone and starts dialing.]

   EXT--ATF BASE CAMP (DAY)

   [SG-1 and Jacob are gathered by their car.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, based on Seth's history, if these guys go in there guns
     a-blazing, he's going to kill everyone in there.

     O'NEILL
     Jacob, can we assume some kind of brainwashing is going on?

     JACOB
     It's probably nish'ta. It's a biological compound that, once
     inhaled, infects all tissue in your body, including your brain. It
     tends to make your mind extremely pliable.

     DANIEL
     That's like what Hathor used.

     JACOB
     It's stronger, it's more encompassing.

     TEAL'C
     I believe that is the substance Apophis used on Rya'c.

     O'NEILL
     Can it be reversed?

     JACOB
     Nish'ta does have an Achilles Heel. Once its effects are reversed,
     it can't reinfect a host. They become immune.

     DANIEL
     Ok, well how do we reverse it?

     JACOB
     There's only one way...an electrical shock. Strong enough to kill
     the organism, but weak enough not to kill the host.

     TEAL'C
     That is why it worked when I shot Rya'c with the zatn'kitel.

     O'NEILL
     Then...we go in with zats.

     DANIEL
     Well, it's not going to be very covert that way. And like I said,
     any kind of frontal attack is going to be a problem.

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Daniel's right, sir. Besides, with all the firepower he's got, we
     wouldn't stand much of a chance anyway.

   INT--ATF BASE CAMP, OPERATIONS TENT (DAY)

   [The phone rings and Hamner answers it.]

     HAMNER
     Hamner...

   [He pauses as the caller speaks.]

     HAMNER

     (cont'd)
     Yes, Mr President. Yes, sir, I am the SRO.

   [The President speaks.]

     HAMNER

     (cont'd)
     Well, yes, sir, they are here, sir. But...

   [The President cuts him off.]

     HAMNER

     (cont'd)
     With respect, sir, the jurisdictional rules in this case are clear,
     this is a civilian matter...

   [He pauses again, obviously not liking what the President is saying.]

     HAMNER

     (cont'd)
     Are you sure you want to do that, sir? Yes Mr President.

   [He hangs up the phone and turns to a subordinate.]

     HAMNER
     Get Colonel O'Neill in here.

   [O'Neill enters the tent.]

     O'NEILL
     Something I can do for you?

     HAMNER
     You want to tell me what's going on?

     O'NEILL
     Didn't you say you know more than I do?

     HAMNER
     Well apparently not. I just got off the phone with the President.

     O'NEILL
     Of the United States of America? Sweet. How's he doing?

     HAMNER
     He seems to have a thing for you.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah well, you know.

     HAMNER
     In fact I'm to issue you an emergency Special Agent credential. He's
     put you in charge of this operation.

     O'NEILL
     Excellent. My first order of business, get me one of those cool
     jackets. Extra large. Double XL if you got it.

     HAMNER
     You want to tell me why the Air Force cares so much about this cult?

     O'NEILL
     Want to do me a favor? On your way out, send my team in?

     HAMNER
     Your team...an odd bunch of people, Colonel. Civilian
     scientists...This Seth guy got some kind of secret weapon you don't
     want the world to know about?

     O'NEILL

     (lowering his voice)
     All right, listen. Since you have clearance, I'll throw you a bone.
     Seth and his boys got their hands on some top-secret technology that
     we would prefer not fall into the public consciousness just yet.
     Comprehend?

     HAMNER
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Now, you've heard of classified.

     HAMNER
     You got it.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you.

   [Hamner leaves and the rest of SG-1, along with Jacob, file into the
   tent.]

     CARTER
     Did General Hammond get the President involved, sir?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. He's put me in charge here for the time being.

     TEAL'C
     What do you suggest O'Neill?

   [O'Neill looks at a map of Seth's compound.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, I'm thinking we need to get in there.

     CARTER
     Ok, how?

     O'NEILL
     The floor is open.

     DANIEL
     Well I was thinking about that. If Seth's MO hasn't changed from his
     history, we know certain things from digs in Giza and in the Valley
     of the Kings.

     CARTER
     We do?

     DANIEL
     For example, many Egyptian leaders built their compounds with
     underground escape tunnels.

     TEAL'C
     That is correct. Apophis had them built into his facilities.

     CARTER
     Ok, so we should do a perimeter search outside the fence and look
     for those tunnel entrances.

     O'NEILL
     It's a lot of territory. We'll have Mr Hamner's men help us.

   EXT--OUTSIDE SETH'S COMPOUND, WOODS (DAY)

   [Hamner's men are using metal detectors to search for a tunnel into
   Seth's compound.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

   [He discovers a grate covering what appears to be a storm drain. He and
   Daniel clear away the undergrowth concealing it as Carter, O'Neill and
   Jacob come up. Carter crouches by the opening.]

     CARTER
     Ok. We've got a point of entry, now what? As soon as we get near
     anyone on the inside, we could get compromised and shot.

     DANIEL
     Or worse. We get dosed with that organism and all of a sudden we're
     working for Seth.

     JACOB
     It won't work on me or Teal'c.

     CARTER
     Yeah, but he'll sense you're Goa'ulds as soon as you're within fifty
     feet. And with the arsenal he's got we wouldn't even get close to
     him without being gunned down.

     O'NEILL

     (to Jacob)
     Which is why you're not going in.

     CARTER
     Dad, you said an electrical shock like a zat gun would snap us out
     of it.

     JACOB
     Yeah?

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Sir, I think I have an idea.

   INT--ATF BASE CAMP, OPERATIONS TENT (DAY)

   [Carter is looking through a microscope as she works on an open
   earpiece.]

     HAMNER

     (to Daniel)
     Give me a test count.

     DANIEL

     (testing his earpiece)
     One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four
     Mississippi, five Mississippi...

   [His voice echoes through the tent as Hamner receives his signal.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     It'll work, sir, assuming Dad's right.

     O'NEILL

     (to Jacob)
     Dad?

     JACOB
     If the jolt is big enough it'll work, but you'll have to stay under
     the nish'ta control long enough for it to spread through all your
     tissues. Otherwise it'll regain a strong hold in your body.

     HAMNER

     (to O'Neill)
     Give me a ten count.

     O'NEILL

     (testing his earpiece)
     One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

     HAMNER
     That's good. You ready for yours, Captain?

     CARTER
     One second.

   [She makes a final adjustment to the earpiece.]

     CARTER
     Ok Teal'c, push the button.

   [Teal'c flicks a switch and a jolt of electricity pulses through the
   ear implants.]

     DANIEL
     Ow!

     O'NEILL
     Hey! Ok.

   [Carter closes the earpiece on the table.]

     CARTER
     Ok. Wire me.

   [She inserts her earpiece.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE SETH'S COMPOUND, WOODS (DAY)

   [SG-1, minus Teal'c, climb into the storm drain.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, TUNNEL

   [O'Neill, Carter and Daniel cautiously make their way down the tunnel.]

     CARTER
     So Daniel, you feel pretty certain that if we get caught, he'll turn
     us into one of those zombies, rather than kill us?

     DANIEL
     Well, we're more valuable to him that way.

     CARTER
     Why? How do you think he'll use us?

     DANIEL
     Well historically, he used women as a harem. They catered to his
     every whim and as a result they were well cared for.

     CARTER
     Super.

     DANIEL
     And the men outside the main court were used mostly as warriors and
     guards, protecting his compound, pretty much doing his bidding.

   [They come to a secure door.]

     O'NEILL
     Dare I ask about the men inside the compound?

     DANIEL
     They were turned into eunuchs.

     O'NEILL
     Eunuchs as in snippity-do-da? Sweet.

   [He opens the door and they enter a large, sealed chamber.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     What?

     O'NEILL
     Now what?

     DANIEL
     Why are you asking me?

     CARTER
     Well you...you knew there'd be tunnels, so...

     DANIEL
     Well, in the digs there were stairs leading up to the main
     structure.

   [Transport rings suddenly come down and take them upwards. They
   rematerialize in Seth's throne room, surrounded by armed disciples, who
   quickly disarm the three members of SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     I hate when that happens.

   [They are shoved roughly to their knees.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey!

   [Seth is sitting upon his throne.]

     SETH
     Welcome. Who are you?

     O'NEILL
     Well I'm Larry, this is Mo, and of course, everyone's favorite,
     Curly.

   [Seth's eyes glow.]

     SETH
     Say goodbye to your impure military past. We're always happy to
     welcome new disciples to the bliss that only Seth can bestow.

   [He raises his hand, revealing a ribbon device. A green vapor begins to
   pour out of the statues either side of his throne.]

     O'NEILL
     So help me, if I wake up and I'm singing soprano...

   [SG-1 succumb to the mist and collapse unconscious to the floor.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, BEDROOM (DAY)

   [Carter, lying on a bed, wearing the white robe of a disciple instead
   of her battledress, is awakened by a female cult member.]

     DISCIPLE
     Welcome disciple. How are you feeling?

     CARTER
     Ok, pretty good.

     DISCIPLE
     Good. Do you feel strong enough to be in service of your god Seth?

     CARTER
     Yes, of course.

     DISCIPLE
     This way.

   [They leave the room.]

   INT--ATF BASE CAMP, OPERATIONS TENT (DAY)

   [Teal'c is listening to SG-1 through their ear implants.]

     TEAL'C
     They are awake. Shall I activate the devices?

     SELMAK
     No. We must wait to be sure the nish'ta has permeated their tissues
     before negating it.

     TEAL'C
     How long?

     SELMAK
     About an hour. It's a smart virus. If there's any unaffected tissue
     remaining in the body, it will give the organism safe harbor in
     which to mutate. Then it will overtake the body once again.

   [Levinson enters the tent.]

     LEVINSON
     Excuse me. Mind if I watch? I mean, my son's in there you know, I
     just want to be involved.

   [Jacob quickly takes back control from Selmak.]

     JACOB
     I'm afraid I can't let you do so. I'm sorry.

     LEVINSON
     Yeah. Figured. Can I grab a cup of coffee?

     JACOB
     Sure, go ahead.

   [Levinson accidentally spills hot coffee on his hand.]

     LEVINSON
     Ow!

   [Teal'c jumps to his feet.]

     LEVINSON
     Sorry. Sorry, it won't happen again. Just been kind of short
     fused...since I found out about Tommy.

     TEAL'C
     I understand.

   [He slowly returns to his seat.]

     LEVINSON
     I find out from his college room-mate, cause...Tommy and me hadn't
     been talking for something like six months before they sucked him
     in.

     TEAL'C
     I do not understand. How could a father not speak to his son for so
     long a time?

   [Jacob appears uncomfortable at the question.]

     LEVINSON
     That's the funny thing about it, I don't even remember why.
     Obviously something pretty stupid in the scheme of things. I'll get
     out of your hair.

   [He leaves the tent.]

     TEAL'C
     Do human parents not love their children unconditionally?

     JACOB
     Sometimes, things get complicated.

     TEAL'C
     Many things are complicated General Carter. In Jaffa society, loving
     one's children is not one of them.

     JACOB
     In human society, sometimes it is.

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, THRONE ROOM (DAY)

   [O'Neill and Daniel, wearing the white robes of disciples, are brought
   before Seth. Carter is already kneeling before his throne. Seth
   gestures to his disciples, who lead O'Neill and Daniel to a collection
   of weaponry on the floor of the chamber. Other disciples are cleaning
   guns.]

     SETH
     With these weapons I have provided, we will defend against any
     incursion by the impure forces outside our gate. Let no other gods
     draw you away from Seth.

     DISCIPLES
     Seth is life, Seth is happiness, Seth is almighty.

     SETH
     Again.

   [This time, Daniel and O'Neill join in with the other disciples.]

     DISCIPLES
     Seth is life, Seth is happiness, Seth is almighty.

     SETH
     Again!

     DISCIPLES
     Seth is life, Seth is happiness, Seth is almighty.

   [Seth suddenly looks down at Carter who gazes up at him in adoration.
   He lifts her face to his.]

     SETH
     You were once blended, were you not?

     CARTER

     (blankly)
     Blended.

   [Seth twists her face to one side.]

     SETH
     No entry marks. But still...I sense a trace. Bring me those who came
     with her.

   INT--ATF BASE CAMP, OPERATIONS TENT (DAY)

     TEAL'C
     General Carter, there is a problem.

   [Hamner suddenly enters the tent.]

     HAMNER
     What?

     JACOB
     It's nothing we can't handle.

     HAMNER
     He made your people, didn't he?

     JACOB
     We don't know yet.

   [Hamner, frustrated, leaves.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, THRONE ROOM (DAY)

   [Daniel and O'Neill are brought once more before Seth.]

     SETH
     Who sent you? The System Lords? The Tok'ra?

   [His eyes flare as he becomes angrier.]

     SETH
     I am your god, you will tell me what I want to know! Who does your
     military work for? The System Lords or the Tok'ra?

     CARTER
     I have a vague recollection of what you're talking about...the
     Tok'ra.

   [Seth gestures and one of his disciples pulls Carter to her feet and
   brings her before the throne.]

   INT--ATF BASE CAMP, OPERATIONS TENT (DAY)

     TEAL'C
     Is it not time enough?

     JACOB
     No choice, do it now.

   [Teal'c flicks the switches that activate the ear implants.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, THRONE ROOM (DAY)

   [SG-1's ear implants emit an electrical charge, breaking the nish'ta's
   control over them.]

     O'NEILL
     We work for a deprogrammer, who hired us to come remove one of your
     disciples.

     DANIEL
     But now we are enjoying the bliss that is Seth.

     SETH
     How is it possible that you enjoy the bliss...when you are able to
     lie to Seth?

   [An armed disciple approaches Seth's throne.]

     DISCIPLE
     My lord, the impure forces that you have prophesied are surrounding
     the compound.

     SETH

     (to SG-1)
     You will pay eternally for bringing this down upon us.

   [He glances at the disciple.]

     SETH
     Take them and kill them.

   [The disciple gestures with his gun for SG-1 to leave the throne room.]

     DISCIPLE
     Go!

   [As SG-1 file out of the throne room, Seth's disciples begin to gather
   around the throne.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, CORRIDOR (DAY)

   [O'Neill turns to the armed disciple.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, a quick question about old Seth...

   [The disciple is distracted and O'Neill is able to knock the gun away.
   Carter grabs the disciple's zat and shoots him with it. The disciple,
   free of the nish'ta, looks at them in confusion.]

     DISCIPLE
     What happened?

     CARTER
     It's ok, we're here to help you.

   EXT--SETH'S COMPOUND, PERIMETER FENCE (DAY)

   [A convoy of vehicles, including a tank, pulls up at Seth's gate.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, WEAPONS ROOM (DAY)

   [Seth takes a round device from out of a crate and hands it to one of
   his disciples.]

     SETH
     We must distribute them throughout the compound. We cannot allow the
     impure access to all that we have built up here.

   [He starts handing out more devices.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, STORAGE ROOM (DAY)

   [Daniel introduces himself to Seth's former disciple.]

     DANIEL
     Um, Daniel.

   [They shake hands.]

     DISCIPLE
     Uh, Tom.

     O'NEILL
     Levinson?

     TOM
     Yeah. I'm really confused. Who are you?

     DANIEL
     We're friends of your father.

     O'NEILL

     (to Tom)
     Where are the zats?

     TOM
     Zats?

   [Carter lifts the zat she took from him.]

     CARTER
     These.

   [Tom quickly unlocks a weapons locker. Its shelves are filled with rows
   of zats.]

     CARTER

     (to Tom)
     Now, can you activate those transport rings?

     TOM
     I-I think so.

   [O'Neill starts handing out the zats.]

     O'NEILL
     Tom, I need you to start transporting people out of here. Can you
     handle that?

     TOM
     I-I guess.

     O'NEILL
     Good.

   EXT--SETH'S COMPOUND, PERIMETER FENCE (DAY)'

   [Armed men are running to take up positions. A vehicle pulls up and
   Hamner and Jacob get out. They start walking towards where Teal'c is
   waiting.]

     HAMNER
     I have to prepare for the worst. If your people have been caught and
     I don't act, it's on me if they get killed.

     JACOB
     It won't be on you, it'll be on me.

     TEAL'C
     It will reside on me also.

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, THRONE ROOM (DAY)

   [Seth's followers are arming themselves, with disciples loading bullets
   into clips. SG-1 enters the throne room and shoots them all with zats.]

     O'NEILL
     Go!

   [Daniel, Carter and Tom help the recovering people to their feet and
   position them in the transport area.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter! Go with them, make sure they get out of here.

   [The transport rings appear and take Seth's former disciples
   downwards.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE SETH'S COMPOUND, WOODS (DAY)

   [Jacob is waiting outside the storm drain. Hamner and some of his men
   are nearby.]

     HAMNER

     (to Jacob)
     Ok, I think I've been very patient...

   [A cloaked disciple suddenly climbs up out of the drain.]

     HAMNER

     (to his men)
     Call the medical teams up here stat...some blankets and shoes. Come
     on you guys, get in here.

   [More cult members start appearing out of the tunnel.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, TUNNEL

   [A set of transport rings appear in the sealed chamber, revealing more
   of Seth's former disciples.]

     CARTER
     Ok come on, let's go, this way. Come on!

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, THRONE ROOM (DAY)

   [O'Neill sends another group of cult members down to the underground
   tunnel, using the transport rings. As he and Daniel start to walk away,
   Seth and more disciples come down the stairs.]

     SETH
     How dare you challenge the power that is Seth?

   [O'Neill and Daniel suddenly turn and open fire, shooting all the
   disciples. But Seth has an energy shield, preventing any shots from
   hitting him.]

   [With a growl of anger, Seth lifts his ribbon device and uses it on
   O'Neill and Daniel, throwing them back. He walks over, then sets one of
   the round devices on the floor between them. He discards his jacket, so
   that he is wearing only the white robe of a disciple. Raising the hood
   of the robe to conceal his face, he uses the transport rings to escape.
   Daniel, recovering, looks at the blinking device.]

     DANIEL
     Bomb?

     O'NEILL
     Bomb.

   [They quickly get to their feet.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE SETH'S COMPOUND, WOODS (DAY)

   [Levinson watches as former cult members are helped out of the storm
   drain. One member emerges whom he recognizes.]

     LEVINSON
     Tommy? Tommy?

   [He reaches down and helps his son out, before pulling him into an
   embrace. Teal'c runs over to Jacob.]

     TEAL'C
     General Carter, our friends have been neutralized. I must go in. I
     believe Selmak will be of help.

     HAMNER

     (overhearing)
     Who's Selmak?

   [Jacob glances up at him as he fits a ribbon device onto his hand.]

     JACOB
     It's a long story.

   [He follows Teal'c into the tunnel.]

   INT--SETH'S COMPOUND, TUNNEL

   [Transport rings appear in the underground chamber. O'Neill and Daniel
   rematerialize, then dive out of the room just in time. Seth's bomb goes
   off overhead and the ceiling collapses behind them. The lights in the
   tunnel flicker from the blast.]

   [O'Neill and Daniel run through the cult members, pulling off their
   hoods as they search for Seth.]

     JACOB

     (at the far end of the tunnel)
     Teal'c, stay outside and cover the other end! Just make sure he
     doesn't get out another way.

   [Carter hears her father's voice and rushes over to him.]

     CARTER
     Dad? Where are you going?

     JACOB
     Setesh used a hand device on Colonel O'Neill and Daniel. Are you ok?

     CARTER
     I'm fine.

     O'NEILL

     (at the opposite end of the tunnel)
     Carter! He's down here!

   [Jacob and Carter pass through the cult members, looking for Seth. They
   pass a hooded follower, but Jacob goes back and pulls the hood away to
   reveal Seth.]

     SELMAK
     Setesh!

     SETH
     Tok'ra kree chok!

   [Seth uses his ribbon device on Jacob, throwing the Tok'ra against the
   wall. The Goa'uld's eyes flare as he disappears into the shadows.
   Carter quickly crouches down by her father.]

     CARTER
     Dad!

     SELMAK
     Your father will survive. Stop Seth.

   [The Tok'ra hands her the ribbon device.]

     CARTER
     How? I can't control this.

     SELMAK
     You have the will within you. You must summon it.

   [Carter reluctantly slips on the ribbon device, goes after Seth.]

     CARTER
     Hey!

   [Seth raises his ribbon device, but Carter is quicker. She uses the
   ribbon device Selmak gave her and Seth is thrown back. As Carter
   crouches down by the injured Goa'uld, he tries to use his ribbon device
   once more. Carter instinctively raises her own and blasts him into the
   ground. Daniel and O'Neill arrive and see Seth's dead body.]

     DANIEL
     You killed him.

     O'NEILL
     Hail Dorothy.

   [Carter looks sickened.]

   EXT--MARK CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)

   [Carter and Jacob walk up the driveway towards the house, sharing a
   quick hug, before Jacob goes up to the door and knocks. It is answered
   by Mark Carter. Jacob embraces him and, after a moment, Mark returns
   the loving gesture. Jacob picks up one of his grandchildren, smiling,
   before entering the house. Carter follows and shares a hug with her
   brother.]
