   FADE IN

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [SG-1 are making their way through a forest, searching for a downed
   UAV.]

     O'NEILL
     What's your reading, Major?

     CARTER
     It should be around here somewhere.

     DANIEL
     Teal'c, you said the UAV must have been shot down by the Goa'uld,
     yet we've seen no signs of Goa'uld civilisation.

     CARTER
     It was hard to tell, the sensors went offline as soon as it was hit.

   [Teal'c finds the damaged UAV.]

     TEAL'C
     Over here.

     CARTER
     Looks like it's been hit by a staff blast.

     DANIEL
     It doesn't make any sense. When a Goa'uld occupies a planet, they
     usually control the Stargate and this Gate had no markings of
     any...ahh!

   [He is cut off as he walks face first into an energy barrier, which
   flares red on contact.]

     DANIEL
     Found something.

     O'NEILL
     Fall back.

   [Carter heads in another direction, but also encounters the energy
   barrier.]

     CARTER
     Uh, sir.

     O'NEILL
     All right, heads up.

   [They duck down and cover their heads as O'Neill fires into the air.
   The energy shield flares red, but his bullets fail to penetrate the
   barrier.]

     ARIS BOCH

     (Distorted, in Goa'uld fashion)
     Your weapons will not penetrate the shield.

   [A man appears from behind a tree, a helmet covering his face.]

     ARIS BOCH
     However, mine will.

   [He fires his weapon and a bolt of energy passes through the shield and
   hits a tree close to where Teal'c is standing.]

     O'NEILL
     Who are you?

     ARIS BOCH
     Aris Boch. Perhaps you've heard of me.

     O'NEILL
     Uh, not I. Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I have not.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well that's disappointing. I'm one of the galaxy's greatest hunters.

     O'NEILL
     Not ringing a bell. Sorry.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, I know you. Captain Samantha Carter. Doctor Daniel Jackson.
     The Jaffa traitor Teal'c. And Colonel Jack O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Well fancy that. We're famous.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [Aris Boch, still holding SG-1 as prisoners, reprimes his weapon.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Drop your weapons.

     O'NEILL
     And if we don't?

     ARIS BOCH
     Do we really have to get so dramatic?

     O'NEILL
     Why not?

   [He grabs his knife and throws it at Aris Boch. It hits the shield and
   falls harmlessly to the ground. Aris Boch laughs.]

     ARIS BOCH
     You were thinking of the personal defence shields the Goa'uld use.
     The ones which allow slower moving objects to pass through. Wouldn't
     make a very effective trap now, would they?

     O'NEILL
     Can't blame a girl for trying.

     ARIS BOCH
     Are you kidding? That's exactly what I would expect from you. Now
     drop your weapons, or I'll kill someone.

   [O'Neill hesitates, then nods to the others, and they start to disarm.]

     ARIS BOCH
     I'm sure you're thinking about escaping, so you should know that
     I've disabled the Stargate dialling device, and even if you did
     overpower me, which is unlikely, you'll never get off this planet.

   [The energy barrier shimmers and abruptly disappears.]

     ARIS BOCH
     This way.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, CLEARING (DAY)

   [SG-1 head down into a clearing, Aris Boch still holding them at
   gunpoint.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Everybody stop. Drop your gear.

   [They start to remove their backpacks and radios.]

     DANIEL
     I don't suppose we could...talk about this.

     ARIS BOCH
     Inside.

     O'NEILL
     Inside what?

     ARIS BOCH
     Barokna.

   [A door suddenly becomes visible behind them. It slides open, revealing
   a corridor and the interior of a Goa'uld ship.]

     O'NEILL

     (jumping)
     Hey!

     ARIS BOCH
     Inside.

   [SG-1 enter the ship and head down the corridor, Aris Boch following
   behind.]

     TEAL'C
     It is a Goa'uld cargo transport. The ship's of an older design. I
     have never before seen the cloaking technology.

     ARIS BOCH
     It's an upgrade.

   [He stands by a door and enters a code into a panel. The door slides
   open, revealing a room beyond.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Let's go.

   [He gestures with his gun for them to enter the room, then locks the
   door behind them.]

     CARTER
     Sir, he's not Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     And? But? So? Therefore?

   [They hear the noise of a sliding door.]

     TEAL'C
     It sounds as though Aris Boch has left the vessel.

     O'NEILL
     Well, what do you say we use the time to find a way out of this,
     huh?

     DANIEL
     Well, even if we could find a way out of here, he said he disabled
     the Stargate.

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c. How fast will this unit fly?

     TEAL'C
     I believe it is capable of travelling twice the speed of light.

     O'NEILL
     Nice. Home for dinner.

     CARTER
     Uh, sir. If you're thinking of trying to steal the ship and fly it
     back to Earth, even at 372,000 miles per second, it would still take
     us at least ten years to get that far.

     O'NEILL
     Should have let the dog out.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [Aris Boch is making his way through the forest. He has been injured in
   his shoulder, the wound covered with yellow blood.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [SG-1 hear the sound of Aris Boch returning to his ship. Teal'c stands
   to one side of the door, ready to ambush the bounty hunter.]

   [Aris Boch keys open the door and points his gun straight at Teal'c,
   apparently anticipating the move.]

     ARIS BOCH

     (to Teal'c)
     Back up with the others. Now.

   [Teal'c reluctantly rejoins his teammates.]

     ARIS BOCH

     (pointing his gun)
     All I have to do is just flinch a little bit, and this will spray
     enough toxic gas to kill everybody in one breath.

   [He sits down and removes his helmet, finally revealing his face.]

     ARIS BOCH

     (speaking normally)
     Dr. Jackson. If you don't mind...treating my wound.

     DANIEL
     I'm an archaeologist.

     ARIS BOCH
     I know, but you're also a doctor.

     DANIEL
     Of archaeology.

     ARIS BOCH

     (sighing)
     Never mind.
     (to Carter)
     Captain? You must have some medical training.

     CARTER
     Actually, I'm a...major now.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh, well how very important. I'll inform the galaxy. Can you get
     over here now and help me, Major?

   [Carter waits until O'Neill gives his permission, then walks over to
   Aris Boch, who points out the various items in his medical kit.]

     ARIS BOCH
     This with this, and then this.

   [Carter takes the items, then pokes at his wound, hurting him.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Aagh!

     CARTER
     Sorry.

     ARIS BOCH

     (laughing)
     Yeah.

   [O'Neill approaches him.]

     O'NEILL
     So. Who shot you?

     ARIS BOCH
     I wouldn't step any closer.

     O'NEILL
     Just...showing my concern.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, like I said before, capturing you was unintentional. The real
     reason I'm here is to catch a Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL

     (interested)
     You hunt Goa'uld?

     ARIS BOCH
     I hunt anyone of value.

     DANIEL
     Which Goa'uld are you hunting?

     ARIS BOCH
     His name is Kel'tar.

     DANIEL
     I haven't heard of him before.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, contrary to popular human belief, the Earth is not the centre
     of the galaxy.

     TEAL'C
     I have not heard of him either.

     ARIS BOCH
     Have you met every Goa'uld? I haven't. The only thing I know is that
     Sokar has discovered Kel'tar is plotting against him.

     O'NEILL
     So you work for Sokar?

     ARIS BOCH
     No.

     O'NEILL
     Self-employed then. Independent contractor. Rogue warrior.

     ARIS BOCH
     I give to the Goa'uld what they want, and they give back to me what
     I want in return.

     CARTER
     How do you keep from getting killed?

     ARIS BOCH
     Takes talent.

     O'NEILL
     So, how do you keep from getting killed?

     DANIEL
     So what do you expect to get for us?

     O'NEILL
     Daniel?

     DANIEL
     Just curious.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, Teal'c is worth the most. The System Lords would love to make
     a good example of him. And Carter here...well, she has the memories
     of the Tok'ra Jolinar. And you O'Neill, you're considered, well,
     you're a pain in the mikta.

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     Neck?

     TEAL'C
     No.

     DANIEL

     (to Aris Boch)
     What about, what about me?

     ARIS BOCH
     You? Probably happy to get a day's rations for you.

     DANIEL
     Oh, a day's rations.

     O'NEILL
     Trade you.

     DANIEL
     I'm just saying that if we know what we're worth, maybe there's
     something we can offer for our freedom.

   [Carter finishes patching up Aris Boch.]

     CARTER
     Done.

     ARIS BOCH
     Good. Back over there.

   [Carter rejoins the others.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Dr. Jackson is right. There is something you can do.

     O'NEILL
     Let's hear it.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, you help me capture a Goa'uld, and I'll let you go.

     O'NEILL
     He's worth that much?

     ARIS BOCH
     Twice as much as all of you put together.

     O'NEILL
     Twice?

     DANIEL
     Twice.

     ARIS BOCH
     What, you're gonna argue?

     O'NEILL
     Why do you need our help anyway?

     ARIS BOCH
     Hey, I take help whenever I can get it. You see, this injury is
     going to take time to heal, and I don't have that luxury. Sokar can
     figure out everything I can figure out, and if I want to trade
     Kel'tar back to Sokar, I've got to get to him first.

     DANIEL
     And how do we know we can trust you?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, my word is good on over two thousand planets.

     O'NEILL
     There are billions.

     TEAL'C
     It would appear we have no choice.

     ARIS BOCH
     Yes. Choiceless. I mean, guys come on! What's the big deal? It's a
     Goa'uld. I hate Goa'uld, you hate 'em. Everybody hates Goa'ulds.

   [O'Neill takes a moment to think it over.]

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, okay, we'll do it.

     ARIS BOCH

     Good.
     (to O'Neill and Daniel)
     You and you, come with me.
     (to Teal'c and Carter)
     You two stay here.

     O'NEILL
     Oh no, wait a minute...

     ARIS BOCH

     (gesturing negatively)
     Uh-uh. Uh uh uh.

     O'NEILL
     Choiceless?

     ARIS BOCH
     You see, that's why I like you. You're quick. Let's go.

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

   [O'Neill and Daniel follow Aris Boch out of the room. He closes the
   door as they leave.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Aris Boch make their way through the forest. Aris
   Boch stops and holsters his weapon.]

     ARIS BOCH
     You trust me, I trust you.

   [He takes out a water bottle, then a vial containing a blue liquid.]

     DANIEL
     What's that?

   [Aris Boch squirts the contents of the vial into the bottle.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Drink.

   [He drinks the mixture.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Aris Boch)
     So what exactly did you have in mind regarding the capture of this
     Goa'uld? What was his name? Kevlar?

     ARIS BOCH
     Kel'tar. You two are going to surrender to him.

     O'NEILL
     That's a bad plan.

     DANIEL
     Er, what if he's in the mood to shoot first and take prisoners
     later?

     ARIS BOCH
     That's your problem. Let's go.

   [They start to move off once more.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, if you really were the greatest bounty hunter in the
     galaxy, you'd grab that Goa'uld yourself and turn us all in.

     ARIS BOCH
     What, and miss the chance of watching the great Jack O'Neill in
     action? Look, do you want to know how I became the greatest bounty
     hunter in the galaxy?

     O'NEILL
     More than life itself.

     ARIS BOCH
     I'm the greatest because I'm alive. That's it. Period. I'm not
     greedy. If I can catch a Goa'uld equipped with all kinds of fancy
     toys without risking my neck, that's a damn good compromise.

     O'NEILL
     Fancy toys?

     ARIS BOCH
     All you've got to do is get close enough to shoot him with a
     zatn'kitel.

   [O'Neill stops and turns to face Aris Boch.]

     O'NEILL
     Ok. Found a flaw in your plan.

     ARIS BOCH
     What's that?

     O'NEILL
     Well, we're exactly one zat gun short of actually having a zat gun.

     ARIS BOCH
     Zat gun?

     O'NEILL
     Drop the n'kitel.

     ARIS BOCH
     I guess it does save a bit of effort.

   [He pulls out a zat gun and tosses it to O'Neill, who checks the
   weapon.]

     O'NEILL
     You're giving me a working zat gun?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, if it didn't work, it wouldn't do you any good. I'm trusting
     you.

   [O'Neill casually shoots him with the zat and Aris Boch collapses to
   the forest floor.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, he disabled the DHD, and Sam said we can't fly that ship all
     the way home.

     O'NEILL
     So we'll fly it to a closer planet with a Stargate.

     DANIEL
     Good thinking.

     O'NEILL
     It happens.

   [Daniel pauses to take Aris Boch's gun, and they head back to the ship.
   After a moment, Aris Boch stirs and opens his eyes, smiling.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, CLEARING (DAY)

   [O'Neill and Daniel enter the clearing, but the door to the ship is now
   invisible.]

     DANIEL
     Well, this is the place.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, how do you open that door?

     DANIEL
     Uh, it opened when he said that word.

     O'NEILL
     Voice-activated. What was the word?

     DANIEL
     Uh, bark something.

     O'NEILL
     Um, almond bark, barcolounger. Beetlejuice!

     DANIEL
     Barkna. It was barkna.

   [Nothing happens.]

     O'NEILL
     Well if it was barkna, the door would be opening, wouldn't it?

     DANIEL
     This was your idea.

     O'NEILL
     You're the linguist.

     DANIEL
     Well, I don't remember.

     O'NEILL
     Well, try.

     DANIEL
     Ok, well I said: "can we talk about this?" He said inside.

     O'NEILL
     I said: "inside what?" He said...

     DANIEL
     He said "barokna"!

   [The door to the ship slides open.]

     O'NEILL
     Gesundheit.

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Picking up their gear, which is still where Aris Boch made them leave
   it, they head into the ship and over to the room where Teal'c and
   Carter are held prisoner.]

     DANIEL
     Ok, he opened the door by pressing a combination of...

   [As he starts to key in some numbers on the door panel, a console
   lights up near the front of the ship. O'Neill and Daniel turn to look
   at it.]

     O'NEILL

     (shouting through the door)
     Teal'c?

   [Carter and Teal'c are hovering on the other side of the door,
   listening to Daniel and O'Neill in the other room. The rest of the
   scene plays out between the two rooms of the cargo ship.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

     O'NEILL
     Yeah! How do you open this thing?

     TEAL'C
     There are six symbols on the pad. You must enter the correct
     combination of five.

     O'NEILL

     (to Daniel)
     How many combinations could there be?

     DANIEL
     Oh boy.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [Daniel continues to attempt to find the correct combination. O'Neill
   heads towards the front of the ship.]

     O'NEILL

     (calling to Teal'c)
     Listen, in the meantime, tell me how to fly this thing.

     TEAL'C
     First, you must locate the main steering console.

   [O'Neill notices a panel with five flashing digits. A computer voice
   announces what sounds like a number in an alien language and the first
   digit remains permanently lit.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, would you come here a moment.

   [Daniel heads over to him.]

     O'NEILL
     What do you think this is?

     DANIEL
     Looks like a countdown?

     O'NEILL
     Of course it is! Oh, Teal'c? Would these ships have any kind of
     self-destruct mechanism?

     TEAL'C
     It is possible.

   [The computer announces another number and the second digit remains
   permanently lit.]

     DANIEL
     We just lost a digit.

     O'NEILL
     Of course we did.

     CARTER
     Oh boy.

   [O'Neill starts trying to input the correct combination into the panel
   by the door.]

     O'NEILL
     So, Teal'c. How does one override the self-destruct?

     TEAL'C
     Open the cowling in the centre console. There should be three
     delmacs.

   [Daniel opens the cowling.]

   [Carter shoots Teal'c a confused look.]

     TEAL'C

     (clarifying)
     Crystals! There should be three crystals!

   [Daniel opens the covering to find one crystal missing.]

     DANIEL
     There's only two. The middle one's missing.

     O'NEILL
     We're missing one!

     TEAL'C
     Then there is no way to override the self-destruct.

   [O'Neill continues to punch in numbers in an attempt to open the door.
   The electronic voice on the device speaks again as another segment of
   the display lights up.]

     DANIEL
     We just lost another digit. Aris must have the other crystal.

     O'NEILL
     Go.

   INT--ALIEN PLANET, CLEARING (DAY)

   [Daniel quickly heads out of the ship and sees Aris Boch walking
   towards him.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Hey! What were you guys thinking?

   [Daniel tries to shoot him, but it doesn't work. Aris Boch grabs it
   from him.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Only I can fire that.

   [He heads into his ship, Daniel following.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [O'Neill points his zat at the bounty hunter.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Put the weapon down.

     O'NEILL
     You put the crystal back.

     ARIS BOCH
     What if I don't?

     O'NEILL
     You won't blow up your ship.

     ARIS BOCH
     Maybe I will.

     O'NEILL
     While you're in it?

   [They wait as the countdown continues. The last digit is activated, but
   nothing happens. Aris Boch reveals the missing crystal, then sets it in
   the self-destruct console.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Now it's set.

     O'NEILL

     (aiming the zat at Aris Boch)
     Put the gun down.

     ARIS BOCH
     Colonel, you think I'd give you a weapon that would work on me?

   [He takes out another zat and shoots himself. The energy discharges but
   doesn't affect him.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Ooh, tickles.

     DANIEL
     Then why did you pretend to be knocked out?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, let's just say I wanted to see you guys sweat a little. Now,
     did we learn something here?

   [He heads over to the room where Carter and Teal'c are still held.
   O'Neill shoots him again with his zat, but it still has no effect.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Ouch.

   [He keys open the door to let Carter and Teal'c out.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Let's go.

   [Carter and Teal'c rejoin their teammates.]

     ARIS BOCH
     You know, I'm very disappointed. I thought we had something good
     going.

     O'NEILL
     Oh come on, what did you expect?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, I offered a fair deal, I trusted you...

     O'NEILL

     (taking his cap off and rubbing his face)
     Oh please.

     DANIEL
     We're sorry, is the deal still on the table?

     ARIS BOCH
     How could I trust you now?

     O'NEILL
     Look, your plan sucks.

     ARIS BOCH
     Ok, we all go together this time!

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, you know we're gonna need our stuff.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well some of that shouldn't be a problem.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [SG-1 are walking through the forest, Aris Boch still holding them at
   gunpoint.]

     DANIEL
     So you don't seem to have much of a problem trading human lives like
     commodities.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh you Earthlings and your morality. Does it ever occur to you that
     someone outside your solar system might not see things the way you
     do?

     CARTER
     Why don't the Goa'uld just take what they want from you and kill
     you?

     ARIS BOCH
     They don't kill me because I deliver. As long as I'm alive, there'll
     always be a next time.

     CARTER
     Why don't they just make you a host?

     ARIS BOCH
     Because they can't. They tried a long time ago when they first came
     to my home planet. But there's something about my race's physical
     makeup that rejected a Goa'uld blending. I don't know why.

     CARTER
     That's incredible.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh yeah, so incredible they wiped out most of my people because of
     it.

     DANIEL
     But not you.

     ARIS BOCH
     I managed to impress them. My people have always been strong and
     skilled. That's why the Goa'uld kept the youngest as slaves...killed
     the rest.

     DANIEL
     Well, you could have your freedom. I mean, there must be lots of
     planets where the Goa'uld wouldn't find you.

     ARIS BOCH
     What freedom? They killed my wife, but my son still lives. He's a
     slave in one of Sokar's naquadah mines. One day I hope to capture a
     prize valuable enough to trade for his freedom as well as mine.
     Let's keep moving.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill is trying on Aris Boch's helmet, zooming in on a section of
   the forest.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, these are cool.

     ARIS BOCH
     Yeah, at the end of that riverbed is the cave where I last
     encountered Kel'tar.

   [O'Neill hands the helmet back to Aris Boch.]

     O'NEILL
     You said he had some fancy toys?

     ARIS BOCH
     At the very least, a small hand device. Plus, when I approached the
     cave, energy blasts fired at me from several directions.

     O'NEILL
     Ok, how about another zat?

   [Aris Boch takes out a zat and hands it to O'Neill. O'Neill checks it
   and throws it to Teal'c.]

     ARIS BOCH
     You shoot that Goa'uld the first chance you get, and I'll stay here
     and set a shield trap.

     O'NEILL
     I thought you'd want to watch us work.

     ARIS BOCH
     I trust you.

     O'NEILL
     You do?

     ARIS BOCH
     Sure. And Major Carter stays with me.

     O'NEILL
     Unacceptable.

     ARIS BOCH
     It's not negotiable. If you don't return, then I turn her over to
     Sokar.

     O'NEILL

     (putting on his cap)
     Yeah.

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel head off, leaving Carter with Aris Boch.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel take cover behind an embankment outside the
   cave where the Goa'uld is sheltering.

     O'NEILL
     So Teal'c, how does one Goa'uld fire weapons from several
     directions?

     TEAL'C
     Tacs.

     O'NEILL
     Tacn'kitels?

     TEAL'C
     Tacunitagaminitarons.

   [The others look at him in confusion.]

     TEAL'C
     Tacs.

     O'NEILL
     What are they?

     TEAL'C
     Automatic remote weapons.

   [O'Neill picks up a rock and tosses it into the clearing outside the
   cave. Nothing happens.]

     O'NEILL
     Heat-seeking?

     TEAL'C
     So it would seem.

   [This time, O'Neill takes out a flare and lights it, before tossing it
   into the clearing. The tacs fire and destroy the flare in a small
   explosion, revealing their locations to Teal'c and O'Neill, who zat
   them. O'Neill moves to another position, while Teal'c takes out a smoke
   bomb and tosses it into the cave. O'Neill finds one of the tacs, which
   rattles brokenly when he picks it up. He tosses it to one side. A man
   suddenly stumbles out of the smoking cave, holding his throat. He is
   injured but armed with a ribbon device.]

     TEAL'C
     Surrender!

   [The man fires his ribbon device and Teal'c quickly ducks, allowing the
   energy surge to pass harmlessly overhead. O'Neill runs out from
   undercover and aims his zat at the man.]

     O'NEILL
     Put your hand down!

   [The man collapses, coughing, as Teal'c and Daniel run over.]

     MAN

     (speaking in a normal, un-Goa'ulded, voice)
     You are Teal'c, the shol'va.

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     Is that a host?

   [Daniel quickly starts to remove the ribbon device from the man's
   hand.]

     MAN
     You are SG-1, from Earth.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, apparently we're well known.

     MAN
     My name is Korra.

     DANIEL
     We were told it was Kel'tar.

     KORRA
     No. Please help me.

     O'NEILL
     Help you?

     KORRA
     I am not Goa'uld. I am Tok'ra.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [Aris Boch is standing on a ledge looking out over the forest, using
   some type of scanning device.]

     ARIS BOCH

     (to Carter)
     I don't have to tie you to a tree or anything unpleasant like that,
     do I?

     CARTER
     No. What is that?

     ARIS BOCH
     Watching your friends.

     CARTER
     How?

     ARIS BOCH
     Magic.

   [He clips the scanner to his arm.]

     CARTER
     Naquadah! The zat guns. That's how you track the Goa'ulds. You use
     their own technology against them.

   [Aris Boch points at her, letting her know she is spot on.]

     CARTER
     You know, the fact that your race rejects the Goa'uld symbiote could
     be very valuable to us. To all humans, all over the galaxy. It could
     be the key to defeating the Goa'uld.

     ARIS BOCH
     I doubt it.

     CARTER
     But if they couldn't use us as hosts...

     ARIS BOCH
     I told you before, I don't understand this immunity.

     CARTER
     Well, we'd have to run some tests.

     ARIS BOCH
     You do not possess anything of equal value worth trading for.

     CARTER
     Your son is being held as a slave. We could help you get him back.
     Would that be valuable enough for you?

     ARIS BOCH
     That's impossible.

   [He takes another drink from his water bottle.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [Teal'c helps Korra to sit down and takes a seat beside him.]

     TEAL'C

     (to O'Neill)
     His injuries are severe.

     DANIEL
     What now?

     O'NEILL

     (to Korra)
     Can you talk?

     KORRA
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     All right, here's what's happening. There's a guy out there...

     KORRA

     (cutting him off)
     Aris Boch.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. He's got us trapped on this planet, and he's holding a member
     of our team hostage...

     KORRA
     Samantha Carter. The daughter of Jacob, host to Selmac.

     O'NEILL
     So you've got good information. Here's the deal. He said if we could
     catch you, he'd let us go home.

     KORRA
     I will not allow myself to be turned over to Sokar.

     O'NEILL
     Can you prove you're a Tok'ra?

     KORRA
     I only have my word. If Samantha Carter were here, she would
     recognise me.

     DANIEL
     Aris must have known Sam would be able to verify whether Korra,
     Kel'tar, whatever his name is, is telling the truth about being a
     Tok'ra.

     O'NEILL
     Well, as far as I'm concerned, you could be a Goa'uld using the old
     "I'm a Tok'ra" thing to get us to help you.

     KORRA
     What did he tell you about me?

     DANIEL
     Just that your name was Kel'tar and you were an enemy of Sokar.

     KORRA
     I was working in Sokar's ranks as a spy. I came to believe Sokar had
     learned my true identity. I managed to escape by stealing a cargo
     ship. It took me several weeks to travel here, the closest planet
     with a Stargate not under Goa'uld control. Aris was already here,
     guarding the Gate. He had anticipated my plan.

     TEAL'C
     Aris Boch claimed the vessel was his.

     KORRA
     It belongs to Sokar, and Aris likely plans to trade it back to him,
     along with us. All of us.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

     ARIS BOCH
     So what's it like to have one of those things bore itself into your
     brain and possess you?

     CARTER
     I couldn't tell you.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh come on, what are you saying?

     CARTER
     You wouldn't understand.

     ARIS BOCH
     What's the difference? They're all the same, Tok'ra, Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     Is that really what you think?

     ARIS BOCH
     They all have different stories, but the same bad blood.

     CARTER
     No, it's not true. And if you really hate the Goa'uld, you'd try to
     learn more about the Tok'ra.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, I wasn't much good at school.

     CARTER
     Well, trying to defeat the Goa'uld is better than the alternative.

   [Aris Boch starts laughing.]

     CARTER
     What? What is so funny?

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh the whole thing is amusing when you know just how insurmountable
     the task is. Defeating the Goa'uld, yeah. Oh admirable, but amusing.

     CARTER
     If enough of the right allies worked together, the task might not be
     so insurmountable.

     ARIS BOCH
     You mean me. Well, I couldn't help you as much as you think.

     CARTER
     You mean you won't. You know what I think? I think you care. And I
     don't think you like what you do nearly as much as you pretend to.

     ARIS BOCH
     I think you should shut up.

   [He points his gun at her, but his hand is shaking. He takes out
   another vial and puts the liquid into his water bottle.]

     CARTER
     What is that?

     ARIS BOCH
     Water.

     CARTER
     What you put in it.

   [He drinks from the water bottle.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Flavour.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

     KORRA
     Aris told you about his wife and son?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

     KORRA
     It's a lie. He has none. Never did.

     DANIEL
     So why does he do this?

     O'NEILL
     Greed.

     KORRA
     Not exactly. It is true that his race cannot be used as hosts, and
     most were slaughtered by the Goa'uld. Those that were kept alive
     were addicted to a substance called roshna. It was given to them in
     their water.

     O'NEILL
     That blue stuff?

     KORRA

     (nodding)
     Now, after many generations, Aris Boch's race cannot live without
     the roshna. They depend on it; it keeps them subservient. If he
     stops taking the roshna, he will die.

     DANIEL
     So whatever the reason, he has no choice?

     KORRA
     I do not defend him. Aris Boch has endeared himself to the Goa'uld
     by being unscrupulous. He indiscriminately hunts both guilty and
     innocent, only caring about whether they have any trading value.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we have to get Carter away from him.

     KORRA
     Does this mean you believe me?

     O'NEILL
     Not just yet. But I'm starting to get that choiceless feeling all
     over again.

     KORRA
     I cannot be turned over to Sokar. He has methods of extracting
     information. There are other Tok'ra operatives in his midst who I
     will not betray.

     O'NEILL
     I understand. Can you walk?

   [Korra nods, and they all rise.]

     KORRA
     I will not burden you.

     TEAL'C
     It is no burden.

     KORRA
     You must leave your weapons.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     KORRA
     Aris can track them. As long as you carry Goa'uld technology, he
     will know our position.

   [Teal'c hands O'Neill his zat and follows Korra out of the clearing.]

     O'NEILL
     Great.

   [He tosses the zats down. Daniel leaves the ribbon device.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [Aris Boch angrily removes his helmet and checks his scanner.]

     CARTER
     What's wrong?

     ARIS BOCH
     I don't see them and they're not moving. Either the Goa'uld got
     them, or they're not playing by the rules.

     CARTER
     So what does that mean?

   [He aims his gun at her and shoots her with an energy beam. She
   stiffens, then falls unconscious to the ground. Aris Boch steps over
   her and walks away.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel, along with Korra, find the place where
   they left Aris Boch and Carter. They see Carter lying unconscious on
   the ledge and quickly take shelter behind a fallen tree.]

     O'NEILL
     It's a trap.

     TEAL'C
     I will go.

     O'NEILL
     No, no. I will.

     DANIEL
     What are we supposed to do?

     O'NEILL

     He's going to have to show himself eventually.
     (to Teal'c)
     Can you take him?

     TEAL'C
     I can.

     O'NEILL
     All right.

   [He quickly makes his way over to Carter's position, while the others
   look on. Keeping low, O'Neill crouches over Carter.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering)
     Carter. Carter.

   [Carter starts to come round and looks up at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Where is he?

   [As Carter looks round in confusion, they hear a ship approaching.]

   [The cargo ship rises up over the ledge, Aris Boch at the controls. He
   wags his finger at them. Teal'c, Daniel and Korra slip away into the
   forest unnoticed.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [O'Neill and Carter are held prisoner once more in the cargo ship's
   hold. O'Neill is waving his hat over an unconscious Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter? Cart...

   [He gets impatient and grabs her face, waking her up.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter! Come on. You passed out again. You all right?

     CARTER
     Yeah, what did I miss?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, not too much. Oh by the way, the Goa'uld Aris wanted us to
     catch? He claims to be a Tok'ra named Korra. Ring a bell?

     CARTER
     Yeah, it does.

     O'NEILL
     He said you'd recognise him.

     CARTER
     Maybe. We can't let Aris trade a Tok'ra.

   [The door slides open and Teal'c, Daniel, and Korra enter, held at
   gunpoint by Aris Boch.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah! Way to play hard to get boys!

     ARIS BOCH
     Well give me a little credit.

     O'NEILL
     Why's that?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, I have what I wanted. The rest of you, you're free to go.

     DANIEL
     You're keeping your end of the bargain?

     ARIS BOCH
     I gave my word.

     CARTER
     Look, I know you think you don't have a choice, but there must be
     another way. If you take Korra, a lot of Tok'ra may die.

     ARIS BOCH
     I've already communicated to Sokar, and one of his mother ships will
     be entering orbit around this planet any time now.

     KORRA
     I will not betray the lives of other Tok'ra.

   [Aris shoots him with the same weapon he used on Carter and Korra
   collapses unconscious to the floor.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell did you do that for?

   [Aris Boch reaches into Korra's mouth and pulls out a capsule.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Poison? That's very un-Goa'uld like. Why would he do that?

     CARTER
     To save the lives of other Tok'ra.

     ARIS BOCH
     Since when does a Goa'uld care about another Goa'uld?

     CARTER
     I told you, the Tok'ra are not the same.

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, Sokar's on his way.

     O'NEILL
     You having...second thoughts here?

     ARIS BOCH
     I have to give him something.

     TEAL'C
     Take me.

     O'NEILL
     Forget it.

     TEAL'C
     I am the most valuable in trade next to the Tok'ra.

     O'NEILL
     I don't care.

     TEAL'C

     (to Aris Boch)
     I will go. Take me.

   [A beeping noise is heard at the front of the ship.]

     ARIS BOCH
     That'll be Sokar.

   [He goes over to the console and switches the beeping noise off, then
   heads purposefully back to the others.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Ok, brief moment of weakness! Teal'c comes with me.

     O'NEILL
     That just is not going to happen!

     ARIS BOCH
     No other way. Last chance to take that Tok'ra and get the hell out.
     You might need this.

   [He hands Carter a crystal.]

     CARTER
     The missing piece of the DHD. Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     We are choiceless.

     O'NEILL
     We'll find you.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh, this is so beautiful, I mean, I'm starting to tear up here, you
     know. But we gotta go. Now!

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, CLEARING (DAY)

   [The cargo ship becomes visible as it prepares to take off. O'Neill and
   Carter help the injured Tok'ra away from the area, Daniel following.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Teal'c, sitting next to the pilot's chair, taps against a shield that
   now surrounds him. It flares, but he is unable to penetrate it. Aris
   Boch sits down next to him.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Here we go.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [The ship rises from the ground and takes off, while O'Neill, Daniel
   and Carter can only look on. Korray regains consciousness and watches,
   confused.]

     KORRA
     What happened?

     DANIEL
     Teal'c went in your place.

     O'NEILL
     Come on. Let's get out of here.

   [He helps Korra to his feet and they head off into the forest.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     ARIS BOCH
     It's a pretty noble thing you're doing.

     TEAL'C
     You have made a sacrifice as well.

     ARIS BOCH
     I guess I never knew the Tok'ra were...different, you know. So what
     made you betray Apophis?

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld are enslavers of worlds. The humans value freedom.

     ARIS BOCH
     You don't really think the Tok'ra and the humans have a chance of
     overthrowing the Goa'uld, do you?

     TEAL'C
     I do.

     ARIS BOCH
     I don't think so.

     TEAL'C
     I would rather serve with those willing to die trying.

     ARIS BOCH
     I really don't want to do this. I hate the Goa'uld as much as you
     do.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill, Carter, Daniel, along with Korra, crest a hill just as Aris
   Boch's ship explodes in the sky.]

     CARTER
     Oh my god.

     O'NEILL
     What the hell?

   [Two pods shoot out of the explosion and race across the sky.]

     KORRA
     Escape pods.

   [They quickly head after them.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, FOREST (DAY)

   [O'Neill, Carter, Daniel, along with Korra, arrive just as Aris Boch
   climbs out of his escape pod.]

     O'NEILL
     Where's Teal'c?

   [Teal'c appears behind them.]

     TEAL'C
     I am here O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Yes!

     DANIEL
     You okay?

     TEAL'C
     I will be fine.

     CARTER
     What happened?

     ARIS BOCH
     I had some technical difficulties, which I communicated to Sokar's
     ship, just after I accidentally removed this.

   [He shows them the crystal he removed from the self-destruct device.
   O'Neill yanks it out of his hand.]

     CARTER
     Glad to have you back, Teal'c.

     KORRA

     (to Teal'c)
     Somehow, I must find a way to pay tribute to what you have done for
     me and the Tok'ra.

     TEAL'C
     There is no need.

     ARIS BOCH
     Hey, guys, what about me? Don't I get a thank you?

     CARTER
     For doing the right thing for a change?

     ARIS BOCH
     Well, it's kind of a back-handed show of appreciation, but I'll take
     it.

     DANIEL
     Won't Sokar be angry?

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh, hopefully he thinks I'm dead. By the time he figures it out,
     I'll be long gone.

     CARTER
     What about the substance you need?

     KORRA
     The roshna?

     ARIS BOCH
     There are plenty of Goa'uld out there I could trade with.

     O'NEILL
     Well. We'd better get back to the Stargate.

     ARIS BOCH
     Oh, uh, Dr. Jackson. I was lying to you before. The price on your
     head is much more than a day's rations. Actually the Goa'uld want to
     see you dead as much as anyone for figuring out the Stargate.

     DANIEL
     Thank you. That doesn't make me feel any better.

     ARIS BOCH
     Major?

   [He takes out a vial of roshna and hands it to her.]

     ARIS BOCH
     Who knows, maybe someday someone will figure out a way for what's
     left of my people to be free of the Goa'uld. And that would be
     something worth trading for.

   [She smiles and heads after the others. Teal'c pauses by Aris Boch and
   bows his head in thanks, before following the others, leaving the
   bounty hunter alone in the forest.]

   FADE OUT
