   TEASER

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate is spinning, successive chevrons locking. Daniel is
   standing at the base of the ramp; he looks at his watch then shoves his
   hands into his pockets. Vala enters accompanied by two SF's. She is
   wearing the leather outfit she first arrived in.]

     VALA
     Came to see me off. That's sweet.

     DANIEL
     Well we've been through a lot together. I just wanted to come here
     myself and make sure you were...thoroughly searched.

   [Daniel signals an SF to go ahead. Vala hands her purse and cape to the
   SF's. Daniel smiles falsely at her, and she smiles back. One SF finds a
   jeweled broach in her purse and holds it up. Vala takes it from him.]

     VALA

     (rubbing the piece)
     This is a little keepsake. Something to remember you by...

     DANIEL

     (taking it from her)
     This is a priceless artifact.

     VALA

     (trying to take it back from him)
     As priceless as the memories we share?

   [Daniel takes the artifact back and puts it in his pants pocket.]

     VALA

     Well.
     (taking her purse and cape back from the SF's)
     Thank you.
     (to Daniel)
     I hate long goodbyes.

     DANIEL

     (very quickly)
     Okay. Good bye.

   [He turns and starts to walk away.]

     VALA
     Don't I even get a hug?

   [He turns back to look at her, wary. He steps over to her, takes her by
   the shoulders very carefully, and hugs her stiffly, patting her on the
   back. He lets go and looks at her, and she smiles at him and starts to
   walk up the ramp. He grabs her arm and pulls her back.]

     VALA

     (surprised, then sultry)
     Daniel! Don't make this harder than it already is.

   [He pries the artifact out of her hand and holds it up in front of
   her.]

     VALA
     Oh. Can't blame a girl for trying.

     DANIEL
     No, I can...

   [As he holds up the artifact, she gently touches his face and rubs his
   beard with one hand. As he watches, she walks up the ramp, turns
   around, and steps backward into the open wormhole. Daniel makes sure
   she is really gone, then begins walking out of the gate room.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Daniel exits the elevator on Level 25, holding and reading a stack of
   papers. Mitchell meets him as he exits. They begin walking together.]

     MITCHELL
     Jackson, hey! Where's the, uh, girlfriend?

     DANIEL
     She left about an hour ago.

     MITCHELL
     Man, I missed the going away party? I hope you saved me a piece of
     cake.

     DANIEL
     Now that she's gone I can finally get some work done around here.

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, about that. The whole SG-1 thing? You never gave me a firm
     answer. What do you say we make it official?

   [Daniel pauses and grips the wall next to him, then starts to turn and
   fall. Mitchell grabs him by the arm.]

     MITCHELL

     (slowing Daniel's fall to the floor)
     Jackson? Jackson! Jackson! I need a med team on Level 25!

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Daniel comes slowly to consciousness to find Mitchell and Lam gazing
   down at him.]

     MITCHELL

     (brightly)
     Good morning, sunshine.

     DANIEL

     (flinching)
     Gaaahhh.

     MITCHELL
     How are you feeling?

     DANIEL

     (looking at them both, suspicious)
     Better. What happened?

     MITCHELL
     We're not exactly sure. But Dr. Lam here thinks it may have
     something to do with those alien cuffs.

   [Daniel sits up very straight, swinging his legs over the side of the
   bed. He looks past Lam to the empty bed next to his.]

     DANIEL

     (to Lam, trying to remain calm)
     Why does one assume that?

     LAM
     Well, you were completely unresponsive when we brought you in, but
     your condition suddenly improved when "she" came back.

   [Lam looks past Daniel's shoulder. He turns around to see Vala sit up
   on the bed behind him, where she had been partially obscured by the
   curtain.]

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Miss me?

   [Daniel appears defeated.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 21

   [Harriman is taking an armful of files from a female airman. Landry
   walks up and puts his arm around Harriman, and they begin walking.]

     LANDRY
     Walter. Just the man I was looking for.

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, sir, we have to talk about your schedule, and according to this
     you're going to be in meetings all day.

     LANDRY

     (taking schedule from Harriman)
     Hell I am.

     HARRIMAN
     Sir?

     LANDRY

     After two months on this base, I've come to realize that an alarming
     portion of these meetings are a complete waste of my time.
     (handing the schedule back)
     This is all housekeeping. You can handle it.

     HARRIMAN
     Me? No, I don't think so sir. I'm not in a position to--

     LANDRY
     Walter! Don't make me promote you.

     HARRIMAN
     No, sir. Yes--yes, sir. I mean, what?

     LANDRY
     Just write up the highlights, and leave them on my desk.

   [Harriman opens his mouth to respond, then just walks away. Mitchell
   and Lam exit the elevator.]

     MITCHELL
     General.

     LANDRY
     Dr. Lam. What's uh...what's the latest on Doctor Jackson?

   [Mitchell surreptitiously buttons the top button of his BDU shirt.
   Landry watches him.]

     LAM
     Well, as evidenced by Vala's departure and immediate return, they
     can't be separated for much more than an hour before they begin to
     feel the effects. If she hadn't come back when she did, I suspect
     they'd both be dead.

     LANDRY
     I thought it was supposed to stop when they took the wristbands off.

     LAM
     It was. Dr. Lee is theorizing that it might have something to do
     with the Ancient communication device they found. It's possible that
     the two technologies brought together somehow combined to create a
     more permanent bond.

     LANDRY

     I see.
     (giving Mitchell an appraising look and a smile)
     Colonel.

   [Lam and Mitchell exchange bemused looks.]

   INT--SGC LAB

   [Dr. Lee has attached electrodes to the Goa'uld bracelets, which lie on
   a table. Vala, now dressed in blue BDU's, removes one of the electrodes
   from her body and tosses it on the table.]

     VALA
     This is a waste of time.

   [Daniel has electrodes attached to his head. Lee tries to reattach the
   one to Vala.]

     DANIEL
     Do me a favor. Shut up.

     VALA
     It's not like I wanted this to happen. Anyway, I'm being realistic.
     He has no idea what he's doing.

     LEE
     I'm standing right here.

     VALA
     He can do all the tests he wants. It's not going to get us anywhere.

     DANIEL

     (irritated)
     Look, I know we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, but it's
     not like we have a lot of choice, unless you happen to know someone
     else who understands this technology.

   [Vala sighs heavily and looks away. Lee and Daniel both look at her.]

     DANIEL
     You know someone? Someone who can help us?

     VALA
     No...and yes.

   [Daniel stands and rips off the electrodes.]

     LEE
     Um, wait. We're not done here yet!

   [Daniel steps right in front of Vala.]

     DANIEL
     Who?

     VALA
     A scientist who was studying the bracelets at one point.

     DANIEL

     (grabbing her by the arm and pulling her up)
     Well let's go see him.

     VALA
     No! Out of the question.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     VALA
     I'd rather not say.

     DANIEL
     He's the guy you stole the bracelets from, right?

     VALA
     How dare you assume that I acquired those bracelets through anything
     but honest means. I may have a less than perfect reputation--

     DANIEL
     You told me you stole them!

     VALA
     Did I?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     VALA
     Oh. Anyway, he won't help us.

     DANIEL
     Correction. He won't help you.

     VALA
     Fine! But if we're going, we'll need a change of clothes.

     DANIEL
     Fine.

   [Daniel leaves.]

     VALA

     (following him)
     Fine.

   [Lee is left holding the bracelets, looking helpless.]

   EXT--A CITY IN A GREEN VALLEY, ARLOS' PLANET, DAY

   INT--ARLOS' LAB

   [The lab has brick walls and an assortment of bottles and tubes on two
   tables. Mitchell and Daniel are wearing leather pants, holsters,
   leather shirts that stitch up the middle, and rawhide-colored, long
   leather over-coats. Daniel is continually adjusting his pants, holster,
   and shirt as if he's very uncomfortable.]

     MITCHELL
     Tell you what, these outfits make a bold statement. You don't reckon
     Landry's gonna make us work them into the rotation, do you?

     DANIEL
     Well, let's see. Desert camo, forest green, and undercover rawhide.
     It's got a nice ring to it.

     MITCHELL
     Well this better be quick. Forty-five minutes away from your
     girlfriend, you're gonna turn into a pumpkin, and I'm gonna have to
     haul your ass back there.

   [Arlos, a short, balding man, enters from the opposite end of the
   room.]

     ARLOS

     (friendly)
     Gentlemen! How can I help you?

     DANIEL
     Well, we require your expertise.

     ARLOS
     Expertise?

     DANIEL
     Well you are the foremost expert on alien technology on this planet.

     ARLOS
     Foremost? Well, I don't know if I'm the "foremost" expert. I might
     be among the top five.

   [Arlos sits at a desk. Daniel and Mitchell sit down across the desk
   from him.]

     MITCHELL

     (laying the bracelets on the table)
     Are you familiar with these?

     ARLOS
     Yes, yes. Actually owned a pair myself up until not too long ago.

     MITCHELL
     So, you know how they work?

     ARLOS
     Of course! The bracelets create a physiological bond between the
     wearers. They were used by the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     Uh, have you ever heard of the physiological bond being sustained
     say, after the bracelets were removed?

     ARLOS
     No. No. Barring some freak power surge in the bracelets themselves
     that might somehow transfer their effects outright, it's highly
     unlikely.

     MITCHELL
     But in the unlikely event this did happen, would you be able to
     sever the connection?

     ARLOS
     I might be able to.

     DANIEL
     Great! Could you tell us?

   [Arlos leans forward in a conspiratorial manner. Daniel and Mitchell do
   the same, Daniel moving some bottles aside.]

     ARLOS
     How is she?

     MITCHELL
     Who?

     ARLOS
     Vala.

     MITCHELL
     We don't know any Vala.

     ARLOS
     Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

   [He starts to get up.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay! Maybe we know a Vala.

     ARLOS
     I need to see her.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     ARLOS
     It's not what you think. I'm not after revenge. The truth is, the
     bracelets weren't the only thing she took from me. She also stole...
     my heart.

     MITCHELL
     Excuse me?

     ARLOS

     (moving his hands and fingers as if to illustrate the story)
     I remember it as if it were yesterday. Some nights, we would steal
     away from the city, strip off our clothing, and bathe in the springs
     of Aragaten. We would chase one another across the mossy hills and
     then lie naked under Adora's moons and Vala would sometimes--

     MITCHELL

     (placing his hand over Arlos' to stop him)
     Okay, that's great, thanks. We got the picture.
     (covering his mouth with his hand)
     A very vivid, very disturbing picture.

     ARLOS
     Yes. Those were wonderful, carnal times. But that's in the past. All
     I ask now is that I be given the chance to see her one last time.
     Bring me Vala, and I'll consider helping you.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, Major Gibson's here to see you.

     LANDRY
     Send her in.

   [He ushers her in, then leaves.]

     GIBSON
     General.

     LANDRY

     (standing up to shake her hand)
     Major. How are things at the Pentagon?

     GIBSON
     Not so good, I'm afraid. The International Committee has reviewed
     your budget proposals and, despite your warnings of how it'll affect
     the day to day operations of Stargate Command, they have decided to
     throw their full financial backing behind the Atlantis mission. They
     now see this base as serving little more than a support role.

     LANDRY
     Can't say I'm surprised.

     GIBSON
     They've been going over the report brought back by Dr. Weir and her
     colleagues. With the prevalence of Ancient technology in the Pegasus
     Galaxy, they feel that's where we should be focusing our efforts.

     LANDRY
     And you believe that?

     GIBSON
     Sir?

     LANDRY
     Atlantis is a civilian operation. They approved Dr. Weir's
     appointment. The reason they don't want to support Stargate Command
     is because they have no say in how it's run.

     GIBSON
     That's what General O'Neill said. He also said he'd be willing to go
     to bat for you with the President. But he thinks it might help if
     you take your case to the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee
     yourself.

     LANDRY

     Does he?
     (chuckling)
     Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

   EXT--ARLOS' PLANET, DAY

   INT--ARLOS' LAB

   [Arlos enters to find Daniel, Vala, and Mitchell waiting, with two
   armed men behind them. Daniel and Mitchell are still dressed in
   leather, and Vala is wearing a black leather jacket and pants.]

     VALA

     Arlos?
     (hugging him gingerly, speaking falsely)
     I thought I'd never see you again.

     ARLOS
     Hello, Vala.

     VALA
     They overpowered me. Some five, six, mercenaries, one morning on my
     way to see you. They demanded that I steal the bracelets under
     penalty of death.

     ARLOS
     I don't care.

   [He moves away and sits behind his desk. She kneels beside the desk and
   gazes up at him.]

     VALA
     Arlos? Are you going to have me killed?

     ARLOS

     (placing his hands on her shoulders)
     No. The memories of what we shared, and you so callously threw away,
     will undoubtedly haunt you until the day you die. That should be
     punishment enough.

     VALA

     (hugging him)
     Mmm, yes, you're right. That should do it.

     ARLOS
     I'm over you. What I am not over, however, is the theft of my
     mother's necklace.

   [Daniel and Mitchell react with surprise and annoyance.]

     ARLOLS
     I want it back. Only then am I going to tell you how to sever the
     link connecting you.

     VALA
     Be realistic. That necklace is gone. There's no way I can get that
     back.

     ARLOS
     Well, then our business is done.

   [He starts to leave.]

     MITCHELL
     Whoa! Hang on, lover boy. We'll get your momma's necklace.

     ARLOS
     Then we have a deal.

   EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL

   EXT--A PLANET, DUSK

   [The planet is desert-like and has a large, sand-colored pyramid.]

   EXT--OUTDOOR MARKET ON VILLAGE STREET, EVENING

   [A Jaffa, Inago, is holding up a two-bladed knife as he walks alongside
   another man.]

     INAGO
     This once belonged to the first prime of Bastet. It's completely
     unique. One of a kind. And I am going to give it to you for three
     ounces of naquadah.

   [The man shakes his head and walks away.]

     INAGO

     Huh? No?
     (holding up another, identical knife and calling after him)
     Uh, two for five!

   [Inago goes back to his booth as Daniel and Mitchell arrive.]

     MITCHELL
     So, business not so good, huh?

     INAGO
     Well, with no planets to conquer and no cities to loot, how's a
     Jaffa expected to put food on the table?

     DANIEL
     Listen, uh, a mutual friend of ours was supposed to send word that
     we were coming.

     INAGO
     What mutual friend?

     DANIEL
     Vala?

   [Inago quickly pulls out a Zat, activates it and aims it at them. They
   raise their hands.]

     INAGO
     Where is she?

     DANIEL
     Uh, we're not sure. She said she had some business to attend to and
     she'd meet us back at the gate. Uh, she didn't call ahead?

     INAGO
     I swore the next time I saw Vala, I'd kill her where she stood.

     MITCHELL
     That's a 'no'.

     INAGO
     Do you take me for a fool?

   [Vala enters the booth from behind him, aiming a large, gun-like weapon
   at his shoulder.]

     VALA
     I don't know about them, but I certainly do. Hello, Inago.

   [Inago sighs and drops the Zat onto the table.]

     VALA
     Nicely done on the distraction, boys.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, that's what we're doing.

     DANIEL

     (stuttering)
     You--you didn't wanna let us in on your little plan?

     VALA
     You would have just screwed it up.

     INAGO
     Vala! You cowardly, backstabbing, sorry excuse for a woman. How've
     you been?

     VALA
     Inago. You filthy, double-talking slug. Nice to see you, too.

     MITCHELL
     Obviously, they used to date.

   [Daniel nods agreement.]

     INAGO
     Do you remember that uh... necklace you sold me? The priceless
     heirloom from the house of Verenna?

     VALA
     I may have overstated its value slightly.

     INAGO
     Slightly? It was worthless.

     VALA

     Huh, you're one to talk. That Goa'uld force shield inhibitor turned
     out to be nothing more than a power coil from an obsolete cargo
     ship. Fortunately, I'm not here for revenge. In fact, (handing the
     weapon to a bemused Daniel)
     I'm here to set things straight. By buying back that worthless
     necklace.

     INAGO
     Why? What's your angle?

     VALA
     You don't need to know.

     INAGO
     Well then I guess you don't need that necklace. No deal. However, I
     am willing to show you how I want to square things here. I might
     consider buying back that useless power coil.

     VALA
     Why would you want to buy back a power coil from an obsolete cargo
     ship?

   [Inago shakes his head, no good reason springing to mind.]

     VALA
     No necklace, no deal.

     DANIEL
     I've got an idea. How about a straight swap? Necklace for power
     coil.

     INAGO
     No!

     MITCHELL
     No wait, wait, wait. I have a better idea. We dig a big old pit, we
     drop these two in it, and we let them fight it out.

     DANIEL
     I'll ask again.

   [Daniel and Mitchell both draw Zats and aim them at Inago, who raises
   his hands.]

     DANIEL
     Deal?

     INAGO

     (disgusted)
     Deal.

     VALA
     Deal. Of course, I don't have the power coil. We're going to have to
     go and get that back.

   [Daniel lowers his Zat in misery.]

     MITCHELL
     Where would you unload an obsolete power coil?

   EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL

   EXT--A GARDEN ON ANOTHER PLANET

   [The power coil sits on a pedestal as people dressed in monks' robes
   and hoods walk serenely by. Vala, Mitchell, and Daniel walk down the
   stairs, and one of the monks sees them and smiles. It is Caius, a
   somewhat rotund man with a reddish beard.]

     CAIUS
     Sister Vasina, welcome back.

     VALA
     Brother Caius.

     CAIUS
     How are the orphans?

     VALA
     The orphans are well. Thank Grannus. And you?

     CAIUS
     Well enough. Thank Grannus.

     MITCHELL
     Who's Grannus?

     DANIEL
     Minor Celtic God. One of Camulus' former lieutenants.

     MITCHELL
     Thanks.

     CAIUS

     (indicating the power coil on the pedestal)
     Of course all of us continue to be grateful for your generous gift.
     Pilgrims from all over the system travel to see the legendary ring
     of Shen Marak.

   [Daniel reaches out to touch the coil but is stung by a force field
   around it.]

     CAIUS
     However, it has been a bittersweet season for us, since
     coincidentally, around the same time you made your gracious
     donation, the shrine's most precious relic, the Livanna crystal,
     mysteriously disappeared.

     DANIEL

     (falsely shocked)
     No!

     VALA
     Yes, it is shocking the depths some people will plumb.
     Unfortunately, I have some more bad news. It appears I was deceived,
     and this ring of Shen Marak is apparently a fake. Afraid you'll have
     to get rid of it.

     CAIUS

     (smiling)
     Out of the question.

     MITCHELL
     Hey! It's bogus! Your followers are worshipping a phony relic.

     CAIUS
     Yes, but ultimately its true worth can only be judged by the genuine
     faith it instills in the hearts of the many pilgrims who come to
     visit the shrine. And, more importantly, in the charitable
     contributions they make while they are here.

     DANIEL
     Right.

     CAIUS
     Of course, if you were willing to make a substantial contribution of
     your own...?

     VALA
     What do you want?

     CAIUS

     (dropping the falsely sweet tone of voice)
     I have to get out of here! I can't take it anymore. The fasting. the
     chanting. Bathing of the poor. If I have to weave one more prayer
     basket, I'm gonna kill someone!
     (to passing monks)
     Blessed day. Blessed day. Blessed day.

     MITCHELL
     Oh my. You're not a real monk.

     VALA
     He used to be a smuggler. One of the best I ever knew. Then things
     got a little too hot for him, and he had to find religion.

     CAIUS
     Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted. Until the great god
     Grannus went and got himself executed by his own Jaffa. Since then,
     the number of pilgrims has been, well, significantly reduced. That's
     why you can't have the ring.

     DANIEL
     Power coil.

     CAIUS
     Whatever. The point is that it's the only thing keeping this place
     going.

     MITCHELL
     If you wanna go, why not just go?

     CAIUS
     Because all I got right now are the clothes on my back. I need my
     cargo ship. The one you "borrowed"?

     VALA
     Ah! Yes, that might be a bit of a problem. But, we can get you a
     replacement.

     CAIUS
     No deal.

     DANIEL
     Wha--what's so special about this particular cargo ship?

     CAIUS
     Let's just say I made a few modifications of my own. You bring it to
     me, and I give you the ring.

     JACKSON AND MITCHELL
     Power coil.

     CAIUS
     Look, don't try anything, all right? The Pilgrims of Grannus may be
     greatly reduced in numbers, but they are more fanatical than ever.
     You'd have to be to be worshipping a dead god. I give the word, and
     they will tear you to pieces before you can get halfway to the gate.
     Now, if you'll excuse me? I have morning prayers to attend to.

   [Caius leaves.]

     DANIEL
     So how do we get this ship?

     VALA
     We can't.

     MITCHELL
     Why not? We've come this far. What's the problem?

   [Vala sighs.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A Goa'uld cargo ship slowly approaches an Al'kesh.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [At the controls are the two aliens that Daniel encountered after being
   kidnapped by Vala on Prometheus. A man appears on a video screen in
   front of them.]

     VOSH
     What news?

     TENAT
     We've put the word out, but she has yet to appear.

     VOSH
     I needn't remind you that because of your bungling, we already lost
     a case of weapons-grade refined naquadah. Now someone has to pay.
     And if it's not Vala, then it might as well be you two.

     TENAT
     Rest assured, Vala can't hide forever. And when she turns up, we'll
     deliver her... dead or alive.

     VOSH
     See that you do, and let it be known that no one defies the Lucian
     Alliance.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Many Al'kesh surround the small cargo ship, indicating the strength of
   the Alliance.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Landry walks around the table where Daniel, Vala, and Mitchell sit.]

     LANDRY
     So let me get this straight. You need to get this ship, to get the
     power coil, to get the necklace, to get this guy to tell you how to
     undo whatever is keeping you two connected?

   [Vala looks at Daniel with a smile as he nods.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, that about sums it up.

     VALA
     Unfortunately, that ship is now in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.

     LANDRY
     The who?

     VALA
     It's a coalition of former smugglers and mercenaries who've banded
     together to take advantage of the power vacuum left by the demise of
     the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     The fact they've managed to form a coherent group makes them unique,
     and a particular threat, especially to the newly formed Jaffa
     government.

     LANDRY
     Can we contact them?

     VALA
     They won't deal with someone they don't know.

     LANDRY
     I assume they know you.

     VALA
     Well... yes, but our last encounter didn't exactly go as planned.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, lemme guess. You screwed them, and now they wanna kill you.

     VALA
     Actually, it was Daniel who messed up the deal.

     DANIEL
     You tried to sell them a stolen ship.

     VALA
     You're the one that told them they couldn't have it. The point is,
     if they see either of us again, they will kill us.

     MITCHELL
     Can we take this ship by force?

     VALA
     You'd have to go up against a sizable armada.

     DANIEL
     If the alternative is staying linked to you, I'm willing to take
     that risk.

     LANDRY
     I'm sorry Dr. Jackson but I can't allow it. Dr. Lee's continuing his
     research; hopefully he'll be able to come up with something on his
     own. In the meantime, you're just going to have to learn to live
     with each other. And by the way, in three days, you're coming to
     Washington.

     DANIEL
     We are?

     VALA
     I am?

     LANDRY
     I need you to testify in front of the Chairman of the Appropriations
     Committee. Let him see exactly what we're up against. Your
     experience with the Ori could go a long way towards convincing him
     of the dangers headed our way.

     DANIEL

     (dubious)
     Right.

     VALA
     We will do our best, sir.

   [Daniel closes his eyes for a moment, while Mitchell puts his hand over
   his face.]

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel makes notes about a stone written tablet, which is broken into
   several pieces. Vala lies on her stomach on the table, leafing through
   a magazine and kicking her feet back and forth. Daniel sets his glasses
   down on an open spot on the table.]

     VALA
     Daniel, do you happen to have one of these... credit cards?

     DANIEL
     Yes I do, and no you can't.

   [Daniel doesn't look up from his work. Vala grunts in disappointment
   then glances toward the door.]

     VALA
     By the way, is the security escort still necessary?

     DANIEL
     Do you really have to ask?

     VALA

     (standing up and walking around the table)
     I notice you've assigned a woman. Were you afraid that I might
     corrupt one of your impressionable young men?

   [As she passes Daniel, she hits him on the rear with the rolled up
   magazine. He flinches but doesn't otherwise respond to her physical
   contact.]

     DANIEL
     No, I just thought I'd save someone the trouble of having to rebuff
     your advances.

     VALA
     How do you know you succeeded?

   [She winks at a middle-aged female SF, who blinks.]

     VALA

     (frustrated)
     I'm so bored! What do you do around here for fun?

     DANIEL
     I'm doing it. I'm translating these artifacts from P4S-559.

     VALA
     Oh. Are they valuable?

     DANIEL
     Well their historical value is immense, but there's no gold or
     jewels involved, if that's what you mean.

     VALA
     Oh.

   [She moves one of the pieces of the stone.]

     DANIEL
     Don't... touch that!

     VALA

     (moving to stand on the other side of him)
     Do you know what? You need to occasionally get up from under the
     dust of dead civilizations and live a little. Why don't you take me
     out to dinner?

     DANIEL

     (moving to his shelves to get a piece of parchment)
     Look, the only way you're getting off this base is on our little
     side-trip to Washington. If we could find a way around that, we
     would.

     VALA
     Why don't we go off world? I've got a great little deal cooked up
     with some traders on Katana.

     DANIEL

     (returning to the table while looking at the parchment)
     No.

     VALA

     We could be partners. We can split everything down the middle,
     sixty-forty.
     (noting he is ignoring her)
     Hardly seems fair that your life gets to continue and my affairs are
     put on hold.

     DANIEL
     Excuse me? I-I-I should be on my way to the Pegasus Galaxy right
     now.

     VALA
     Oh don't you blame that on me. It's your own curiosity in the
     ancient treasure that cost you a trip to Atlantis.

     DANIEL
     You cuffed us together!

     VALA
     You weren't paying attention at the time.

   [Daniel finally breaks, stopping his work and putting his hand to his
   face.]

     VALA
     Look, we can point fingers all we want, but the fact is, we're stuck
     together. So like it or not, we're just going to have to learn to
     get along.

   [She hops up to sit on the table and lands on his glasses, breaking
   them. She leans to the side and pulls them out from beneath her
   bottom.]

     VALA

     (smiling uncomfortably)
     Found your glasses.

     DANIEL

     (taking and staring at the broken glasses, with their twisted
     frames)
     I'm gonna go see what Dr. Lee's doing.

   [After he leaves, Vala rebelliously pushes at the stone artifact
   again.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF DANIEL'S VIP QUARTERS

   [Daniel walks slowly toward his room, his hands in his pockets. He
   looks to his left to see a guard standing outside of Vala's VIP room,
   who looks down as he walks by. He continues to his room and uses his
   keycard to enter.]

   INT--DANIEL'S VIP SUITE

   [Daniel enters and turns on the light. He looks up to see Vala in his
   bed, the covers pulled up to her chin.]

     VALA
     Hello.

     DANIEL
     What the hell are you doing here?

     VALA
     Isn't this my room?

     DANIEL

     (gesturing behind him)
     No, your room is across the hall with the guard in front of it.

   [Daniel glances back at the closed door, confused.]

     VALA
     Ah yes, they do all rather look alike, don't they? Anyhow, since I'm
     here, shall we make the best of it?

   [She throws back the covers to reveal she is dressed in a red
   sleeping-style tank top and matching underwear. She puts her hands
   behind her head in a pose of invitation.]

     DANIEL

     (in shock, emphatic)
     No, we shalln't.

     VALA

     (getting up onto her hands and knees, facing him)
     Come on, Daniel. We're both stuck here on this base, and there's
     nothing else to do.

     DANIEL
     Yes, there is! There's--there's--there's sleeping, there's working,
     there's--there's finding a way out of this mess!

     VALA
     What if we can't? We might have to spend the rest of our lives
     together.

     DANIEL

     (horrified)
     No! Don't even go there.

     VALA
     There's literally a bond between us. Some people might even find
     that romantic.

     DANIEL
     I'm not one of those people.

   [She moves to sit on the edge of the bed, her feet resting on the bed
   frame, showing off her long legs.]

     VALA
     Am I really so repulsive?

     DANIEL

     (quickly, then considering)
     No! Uh...no!
     (moving to sit on the footboard of the bed, facing mostly away from
     her)
     No you're not... repulsive, you're just... uh... It's just that I
     know what you're doing with the whole sexual thing. It's a defense
     mechanism.

     VALA
     Really?

     DANIEL

     (matter of factly)
     Yeah. You live a solitary existence, you move from place to place,
     you never form any lasting relationships, you use sex as a weapon to
     prevent yourself from forming any real emotional bonds.

   [He counts the items off on his fingers and shrugs.]

     VALA

     Textbook case.
     (sadly)
     Never realized I was so transparent.

   [She gets up and starts to leave, hurt.]

     DANIEL
     Vala...

     VALA

     (putting on a white bathrobe, angry and emotional)
     No really it's--it's fine Daniel, you're right. I can see why you
     wouldn't want to become involved with someone so pathetic. I wasn't
     always like this, you should know. There was someone once. In fact,
     I was engaged. Then I was taken as a host and, even though the
     Tok'ra eventually freed me, the damage was already done. And once
     you have been spat on, and stoned by the people of your own
     village... Well, you try forming lasting relationships.

   [She puts on her shoes clumsily and starts to go.]

     DANIEL
     Vala, wait. Just wait. Please. Stop.

   [She stops but keeps her back to him.]

     DANIEL

     All right, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. I just... Sometimes I just...
     I forget what you've been through.
     (suddenly realizing)
     If you've actually been through any of that. Are you messing with
     me?

     VALA

     (through the side of her mouth)
     Is it working?

     DANIEL

     (pointing at the door)
     Get out. Go. Get out. Go.

   [She leaves and shuts the door behind her. Daniel looks around his
   room, overwhelmed.]

   EXT--WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY

   INT--APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Dressed in formal attire, Teal'c, Daniel, Landry, and Vala are seated
   at a table across from a long committee desk. Only Senator Fisher and a
   woman are seated at the desk.]

     TEAL'C
     Despite the fact that the Jaffa are free and Anubis has been
     defeated, it would be a mistake to assume that the Goa'uld are no
     longer a threat.

     FISHER
     But without the Jaffa to do their bidding, they're effectively
     crippled.

     TEAL'C
     Many still have the loyalty of their human slaves.

     FISHER
     Slaves are a long way from an effective army, and, besides, if the
     Jaffa saw the light, it will only a matter of time before these
     slaves follow suit.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld aren't the only threat out there, sir.

     FISHER
     So I assume that you're referring to these people you supposedly met
     in a distant galaxy.

     DANIEL
     Supposedly?

     FISHER
     Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but according to the report I read,
     you never actually left Stargate Command. You went into a coma, had
     some kind of vision. For all we know the whole thing could have been
     an elaborate hallucination.

     DANIEL
     One of the Priors came through the gate.

     FISHER
     A single man who did nothing but spout a lot of religious nonsense
     and then killed himself.

     LANDRY
     Senator, I was there. The man burned himself to death, without the
     aid of any obvious devices or technology. It was no parlor trick.

     DANIEL
     We're also beginning to get reports that there are other Priors
     showing up on other planets.

     FISHER
     Well it's hardly surprising that new religious groups would arise in
     the wake of the Goa'uld's collapse.

     DANIEL
     The Ori are very real, Senator. As ascended beings, they have all
     the appearance of genuine gods.

     FISHER
     But again, this is according to your testimony: they cannot act in
     this galaxy without incurring the interference of these other
     ascended beings. Isn't that correct?

     DANIEL
     Technically, yes.

     FISHER
     Well, look at it from our point of view, Dr. Jackson. Finally after
     eight years and billions of dollars spent, the Goa'uld have been
     neutralized, along with the Replicators. And now suddenly, out of
     nowhere, along come these magical Ori requiring a redoubling of
     efforts and expenditures.

     LANDRY
     Exactly what are you suggesting, Senator?

     FISHER
     The Stargate Program has succeeded in acquiring alien technology. So
     now it's time to devote our resources to exploiting those
     technologies for planetary defense, namely by building more
     Daedalus-class ships. Now we have no intention of shutting you down
     completely. You will continue to operate at thirty percent of your
     current budget. I think you will find that that is more then enough
     money once you de-emphasize new exploration.

     DANIEL
     Uh, if you recall, Senator, it was new exploration that got us those
     technologies in the first place. Now there are still thousands of
     Stargate addresses left unexplored in this galaxy.

     FISHER
     This program doesn't exist to satisfy your curiosity, Doctor. The
     important thing is that we have learned enough to defend this planet
     against any potential threats.

   [Vala laughs out loud while taking a sip of water from a large glass.
   The others look at her as she swallows loudly.]

     FISHER
     Do you, uh, have something to say?

   [In spite of Daniel's gesture for her to stop, Vala stands up and
   approaches Fisher, running her fingers along the desk in front of him.
   She is wearing a short leather skirt, patterned fishnet stockings, and
   knee-high leather boots.]

     VALA
     Well it's just all so amusing, isn't it. I mean only an idiot would
     assume that this backwater of a planet was safe because you have a
     few ships with decent shield technology.

   [She sits on the desk near him, crosses her legs, and turns her face
   dramatically to Fisher. He is looking at her with confusion and
   interest.]

     VALA
     You don't look like an idiot to me. So, I have to assume that the
     reason why you would want to build more ships is, like other men,
     you like big machines with big engines that fire big missiles
     because you have a deep-seated need to overcompensate for your own
     shortcomings.

     FISHER
     Excuse me?

   [The woman next to Fisher smirks to herself.]

     VALA
     See, she knows what I mean.

   [Vala waggles her little finger at the woman. Fisher looks over at the
   woman horrified.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, I think a short recess would be a good idea.

     VALA
     I'm done here anyway.

   [She steps off the desk and back toward Daniel. Fisher stands.]

     FISHER
     This meeting is over.

   [Landry looks very angry.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell greets Landry in the corridor. Landry walks past him as he
   speaks, then Mitchell catches up and walks beside him.]

     MITCHELL
     How did it go, sir?

     LANDRY
     Let's just put it this way, you're going after that ship.

     MITCHELL
     The cargo ship. What about the Lucian Alliance, sir?

     LANDRY
     You'll have to figure out a way to deal with them.

     MITCHELL
     Why, what happened?

     LANDRY
     She accused the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee of
     having a, let's just call it an insufficient manhood. She's gotta
     go.

   [Landry continues on, followed by Vala, Daniel, and Teal'c.]

   EXT--WOODS ON A PLANET, DAY

   [Vala, Mitchell, Daniel and Teal'c are walking along a path under
   moss-covered trees. They are dressed again in their leather outfits,
   including Teal'c this time.]

     VALA
     Just a word of warning. Tenat and Jup are notoriously unscrupulous
     traders. They're crafty, devious, and although stupid, under no
     circumstances are they to be trusted.

     MITCHELL
     In other words they're going to try to screw us before we screw
     them.

     VALA
     It should be all right as long as you keep your guard up, and we
     keep focus on what needs to be done. Close the deal, take the ship,
     and make sure they don't kill me. Certainly not in that order.

     MITCHELL
     I still think we need some more boots on the ground, just to be
     safe.

     VALA
     Tenat will most certainly run a surface scan of the planet.
     Additional life signs or any ships in orbit will only raise
     suspicions and jeopardize everything.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE THE PLANET

   [A cargo ship approaches the planet.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Tenat and Jup sit at the controls.]

     TENAT
     We're approaching the planet. Run a surface scan.

     JUP

     (doing so)
     Four life signs.

     TENAT
     Let's go greet them.

   [Jup gets up from his chair and moves to the rear of the ship.]

   EXT--WOODS ON PLANET, DAY

   [Daniel and Vala are walking together, followed by Mitchell and
   Teal'c.]

     VALA
     This is a good plan. Very inspired.

     DANIEL
     Yes, we have you to thank for that. Nothing motivates like complete
     and utter desperation.

     VALA
     You say that now, but you will miss me when I am gone.

     DANIEL
     No, I'm pretty sure I won't.

     MITCHELL
     Just like old times, huh?

     TEAL'C
     I am offering my assistance on this mission only to aid Daniel
     Jackson. My participation should not be construed as a desire to
     rejoin SG-1.

     MITCHELL
     Right.

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell, at times you remind me of O'Neill.

     MITCHELL
     Ah, well, I'll take that as a compliment.

     TEAL'C
     As you wish.

   EXT--WOODS ON PLANET

   [Nearby, Tenat runs along the path, while Jup walks from the opposite
   direction. In a clearing, Mitchell and Teal'c stand guard while Daniel
   and Vala sit on a log, their hands tied behind their backs. Mitchell
   sees Tenat.]

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c.

   [Mitchell faces Tenat, his arms crossed, hands hidden in his coat.
   Behind him, Teal'c, facing the opposite direction, aims his weapon
   towards Jup, who leaves his cover and walks into the clearing. Tenat
   and Jup have their weapons drawn.]

     MITCHELL
     Hey, fellas. What's with all the hostility?

     TENAT
     Vala, how does it feel knowing your sorry life is about to end?

     VALA
     I don't know. How did it feel telling the Alliance that you
     half-wits lost their naquadah?

   [Tenat aims his weapon at Vala.]

     MITCHELL

     (drawing his own zat from under his coat)
     Whoa! No--no--no violence. No damaging the goods until we've
     finished our deal. Besides I think the Alliance wants to hold her up
     as an example.

     TENAT
     Yes, they do. Your name?

     MITCHELL
     Cam Mitchell. Bounty hunter.

     TENAT
     Never heard of you.

     MITCHELL
     That's because I keep a low profile. I like to let my work speak for
     itself.

     TENAT
     You've partnered with a Jaffa, I see.

     MITCHELL
     Look, we'd love to sit around and talk shop, but we're on the clock.
     Where's our reward?

     TENAT
     We have a caseload of weapons-grade refined naquadah sitting in our
     cargo ship.

     MITCHELL
     Good. Let's go get it.

     TENAT
     No. I will stay here with you while Jup takes Vala and her partner
     to the ship. Once they've been secured, he'll return and ring the
     naquadah down to you.

   [Tenat gestures for Jup to go.]

     MITCHELL
     And what's to stop old Jup here from ringing you away and just
     skedaddling.

     TENAT
     Our honor. It would not be in our best interests to cheat you. After
     all, we have reputations as traders to uphold.

   [Jup leads Daniel and Vala away.]

     MITCHELL
     Right... reputations.

   EXT--LARGE CLEARING ON PLANET

   [The cargo ship sits in the clearing.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Jup walks Daniel and Vala into the cargo area.]

     DANIEL
     I can't help noticing the absence of the caseload of refined
     naquadah you guys were promising.

     JUP
     Do you seriously think the Alliance would have entrusted us with
     another case after we lost the last one?

     DANIEL
     So this is a double cross. What happened to 'upholding your
     reputation'?

     JUP
     Let's just say those bounty hunters won't be in a position to do any
     complaining.

   [Jup seals the door to the cargo area from the outside. Vala
   immediately starts to pull on her handcuffs.]

     VALA
     Uh... ow.

   [Her cuffs release and she goes to open Daniel's.]

     DANIEL
     Ow!

     VALA

     Hold still.
     (releasing his cuffs)
     Told you.

   by memory.]

     I can do it. Just uh, do me a favor. I need some help.

     VALA
     Okay, what?

     DANIEL
     Go to the panel by the rear exit.

   [She walks over there.]

     VALA
     Okay, now what?

     DANIEL
     Stay there, shut up, and let me finish.

   EXT--CLEARING IN WOODS

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, they got a great secondary and the league's best pass rush.
     Offense wins games, but defense wins championships. Am I right?

   [They hear something above and look up. The cargo ship comes in to
   hover just above the trees.]

     TENAT
     Our cargo ship has returned. I suggest you lower your weapons.

   [Mitchell lowers his Zat and pushes Teal'c's arm down as well, to
   Teal'c's confusion.]

     MITCHELL
     I take it we're not getting our naquadah.

     TENAT
     No, you're not, and so concludes our deal.

   [The rings activate, taking Mitchell and Teal'c and leaving an
   unconscious Jup. The ship speeds away. Tenat slumps his shoulders in
   defeat. He activates a device on his belt.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Mitchell walks onto the bridge from the cargo/ring area, followed by
   Teal'c. Vala is at the piloting station.]

     MITCHELL

     (taking off his overcoat)
     Well! That went better than I expected.

     VALA
     I'm picking up ships. Lots of them.

     MITCHELL
     Correction. That went much worse than I suspected.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The cargo ship is heading right for a large number of Al'kesh. It is
   the Lucian Alliance fleet.]

   [Some time later, the cargo ship sits face-to-face with the Alliance
   ships.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     VOSH

     (over radio)
     Stand down, and prepare to be boarded.

   [Vala and Teal'c are in the command chairs, with Daniel and Mitchell
   behind them.]

     MITCHELL
     Shouldn't we be jumping to hyperspace or something?

     TEAL'C
     They will pursue us.

   [Vala hits some controls on the center console.]

     DANIEL
     What are you doing?

     VALA
     Caius said he customized this ship. Let's see if there's anything we
     can use.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Al'kesh begin to materialize all around the cargo ship, facing off
   against the Alliance ships.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     DANIEL
     What's happening?

     VALA
     Multiple energy signatures of phantom vessels. They're confusing the
     Alliance ships.

     MITCHELL
     Fine! Let's go, let's go, let's go.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The cargo ships heads out over the Alliance Ships, leaving the false
   Al'kesh behind. Two Alliance Al'kesh peel off to follow the cargo
   ship.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     TEAL'C
     There are two vessels pursuing us.

     MITCHELL
     You got anything else in that bag of tricks?

     VALA
     I'll show you.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ship turns on its axis to face the pursuers. The team members are
   visible in the cockpit through the ship's windows.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [The lights and power begin to shut down.]

     MITCHELL
     What are you doing?

     DANIEL
     Vala?

     VALA
     Wait for it... Now!

   [She activates something.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A blue wave leaves the cargo ship and moves past the two Al'kesh,
   shutting down their power.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     MITCHELL
     Wicked.

     VALA

     (bringing the power back on)
     Pulse wave. Their power levels spiked and overloaded. It should take
     a couple of minutes to restore primary systems. Which should give us
     enough time to...

   EXT--SPACE

   [The cargo ship speeds past the disabled Al'kesh and enters
   hyperspace.]

   INT--A BAR

   [Caius, no longer in monk's robes, and Vala are seated, Mitchell and
   Teal'c standing. Daniel is standing, packing the power coil into a
   carrying case. They prepare to leave.]

     CAIUS
     Thanks for getting my ship back. And for not helping yourself to the
     swag in the ship's hidden compartments.

   [As they are leaving, Vala turns back, but Mitchell and Daniel drag her
   away as she calls back.]

     VALA
     Wait! Did you, did you just say hidden compartments?

     CAIUS

     (laughing)
     Bye bye.

     VALA
     No! Wait!

   EXT--INAGO'S BOOTH IN THE MARKET

   [Daniel drops the power coil onto Inago's table.]

     VALA
     So, really. Why would you want to trade a power coil from an
     obsolete cargo ship?

     INAGO

     (holding up the necklace)
     So, really. Why would you want to trade for this worthless necklace?

     VALA AND INAGO

     (exchanging the items)
     Never mind.

   [They leave as Inago packs the coil back up.]

   INT--ARLOS' LAB

   [Vala hands the necklace to Arlos.]

     ARLOS
     Excellent. Finally, I can get Mother off my back.

   [He stands and starts to walk away.]

     MITCHELL
     So?

     ARLOS
     So?

     DANIEL
     So, we had a deal, remember? Give you the necklace, and you sever
     the link.

     ARLOS
     Yes, yes of course. I've been doing extensive research, um...

     DANIEL
     And?

     ARLOS
     Well, there's nothing I can do. The effect can't be countered. But
     you know? My guess is, it'll wear off eventually on its own. So
     long, everybody.

   [Daniel appears shell-shocked.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Daniel, dressed again in BDU's, is speaking to Landry.]

     LANDRY
     That's it? You went through all that for nothing?

     DANIEL
     Pretty much.

     LANDRY
     I can't wait till Senator Fisher hears about this one.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, have you heard any news?

     LANDRY
     I spoke to the President. He gave me two choices. Accept the budget
     cuts, or convince the International Committee to change their minds
     and contribute to our funding.

     DANIEL
     Right. How do we do that?

     LANDRY
     Give them what they want. A new civilian position, appointed by the
     Committee, with full access to this base and a say in all major
     decisions concerning its operation.

     DANIEL
     Watch dog.

     LANDRY
     Exactly.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The gate activates. At the base of the ramp are Teal'c, dressed in
   Jaffa robes, Daniel, Vala, and Mitchell. Daniel grasps Teal'c's arm,
   and they embrace.]

     DANIEL
     Thanks for helping out.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     MITCHELL
     Good luck on Dakara.

   [Teal'c nods at Mitchell, then looks at Vala, who waves at him as
   Daniel looks at her. Teal'c continues up the ramp.]

     MITCHELL
     Don't be a stranger.

   [Teal'c steps through the gate, which shuts down. Daniel appears
   wistful.]

     MITCHELL

     (smiling)
     He'll be back.

   FADE OUT
