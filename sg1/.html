<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>FADE IN</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Five airmen are sitting on duty around a table at the bottom of the ramp, playing poker.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
<p>Oh man, this hand's as lousy as this detail. All right, everybody, ante up.<br />
(looking to female airman)<br />
That's you too.<br />
(he deals)<br />
</p>
Seven to the deuce, nothing there. Boss and the eight, nothing happening. Queen to the king, possible straight going there. Eight on the eight, and the jack gets a boss.  Eights open.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Aren't you guys afraid of an officer coming down here or something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 2<br />
Trust me, nobody ever comes down here but us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
<p>(looking to the slightly billowing Stargate cover)<br />
</p>
Does that thing always do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Do what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Whatever it is under the tarp, I just&#8230;saw it move or do something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 2<br />
Probably the only thing it ever did was cost money.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Yeah, and it looks like they ran out of that.  They've been shipping personnel out of here for months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
<p>(seeing tarp move again)<br />
</p>
I'm telling you, the thing is moving!</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 2<br />
If you don't have the straight, just fold.</blockquote>
<p>[She gets up from her seat and makes towards the covered item.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
<p>(agitated)<br />
</p>
Can we take that as a fold?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 2<br />
Just finish the hand, she's out.</blockquote>
<p>[The female airman approaches the tarp and starts up the ramp.  It starts shaking suddenly, they hear a rumbling sound, and she backs away down the ramp as it shakes along with the table where the other airmen are seated. The jump to their feet, hands to their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 3<br />
What the&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[The tarp flies from the device and reveals the Stargate spinning and active.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 3<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
I take it this has never happened before?</blockquote>
<p>[Airman 2 goes to the red phone on the wall as the other stand ready at the base of the ramp. The Stargate activates&#8212;the kawhoosh expands outwards and, he drops the phone.  The others fall to the ground as the event horizon billows out towards them. Airman 1 passes out guns, and they ready them, standing and waiting in front of the Stargate. The female airman starts up the ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[As she reaches the Stargate, a ball drops through it to her feet, glows, and seems to scan her bodily. It falls still, and she bends down to touch it.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 3<br />
What are you doing? </blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Don't touch it!</blockquote>
<p>[She picks it up, looking back to them in confusion. Then a serpent guard steps through the wormhole right on top of her, taking a hold of her round the neck and taking her gun. The other airmen aim their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Hold your fire!</blockquote>
<p>[More serpent guards come through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Identi&#8230;Hold it&#8230;Identify yourself!</blockquote>
<p>[The last figure steps through the Stargate, his armour made of gold. He stands in front of his seven guards and reveals his face&#8212;a human face.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
<p>(in echoing voice)<br />
</p>
Jaffa! Kree!</blockquote>
<p>[The guard holding the female airman reveals his face, and Apophis turns to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
Teal'c, kree!</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c studies the female airman's gun, then drops it and passes the woman roughly to Apophis.]
</p>
<blockquote>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Get your hands off me!</blockquote>
<p>[Apophis brings his hand up and a device emits a glow that latches on to her face, she becomes calm.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 1<br />
Let her go!</blockquote>
<p>[One of the serpent guards fires with his staff weapon, and a fire fight ensues. Teal'c covers the female airman with his body as the bullets bounce off the Goa'uld armour. Apophis sees one of his guards go down.  One of the airmen is hit, and he crashes into the card table.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
Kree! Jaffa!</blockquote>
<p>[He waves them back.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN 2<br />
<p>(into the phone)<br />
</p>
We're under fire down here.  We need&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He is hit by a staff blast and goes down. Airmen 1 continues firing until he too is finally struck. The base alarms have started sounding.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
Teal'c. A'la spree.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks towards the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BASE CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Airmen are running for the gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SF<br />
Go, go!</blockquote>
<p>[The Mountain doors close.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[General Hammond and the airmen stream in and take position.  All but Apophis, the female airman and two of his guards are gone.  One picks up the scanning device. The airmen cock their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Hold your fire!</blockquote>
<p>[Apophis's eyes glow, his helmet goes up, and they retreat through the Stargate.  It dissipates.]
</p><p><b>END OF TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OUTSIDE O'NEILL'S HOUSE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Major Samuels gets out of his car and walks towards the house, he knocks on the door. An airman accompanying him moves round to the side of the house.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Sir, there's a ladder over here.</blockquote>
<p>[They climb up to where O'Neill has his eye to a telescope pointing to the sky.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Colonel Jack O'Neill?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(not looking at him)<br />
</p>
Retired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
I'm Major Samuels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Air Force?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Yes, sir, I'm the General's Executive Officer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Want a little piece of advice, Major? Get re-assed to NASA. That's where all the action's gonna be. Out there.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill continues looking at a galaxy formation through the telescope.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
I'm uh, I'm under orders to bring you to see General Hammond, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Never heard of him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
He replaced General West. He says it's important. Has to do with the Stargate.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill finally looks around, interested.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN BASE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[A car enters the base.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ELEVATOR</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill, dressed in casual clothes, is accompanied by an officer down to Sublevel 11. They walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>INTERCOM<br />
Tag team number nine to Sublevel Two, Vent Shaft Twenty-Four.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill signs in at the desk, and they head for a second elevator.]
</p>
<blockquote>OFFICER<br />
We have to take a second elevator the rest of the way, sir, it's a long way down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(entering the elevator)<br />
</p>
Yeah I know.  I've been here before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OFFICER<br />
Ah, of course.</blockquote>
<p>[The elevator descends, and they get out.  Samuels is at the end of the corridor.  He motions O'Neill towards a door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
 This way, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Samuels follows O'Neill, and the officer takes Samuels's position.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HAMMOND'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[There are two knocks on the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Come.</blockquote>
<p>[Samuels and O'Neill enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Retired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
I can see that. Me, I'm on my last tour. Time to start getting my thoughts together, maybe write a book. You ever think of writing a book on your exploits in the line of duty?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>I've thought about it, but then I'd have to shoot anyone that actually read it.<br />
(getting no response)<br />
</p>
That's a joke, sir. Most of my work the last ten years was classified.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Yes, of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Major Samuels mentioned something about the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>Down to business, I can do that.<br />
(standing)<br />
</p>
This way.</blockquote>
<p>[They all leave the office.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LAB</b>
</p><p>[A doctor pulls back a sheet from dead Jaffa's face.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Anyone you know, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
They're not human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Ya think?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
Best we can tell, these slits are actually a pouch, similar to that found in a marsupial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Like a kangaroo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
We haven't done an autopsy yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
These people&#8212;or aliens&#8212;or whatever you want to call them&#8230;came through&#8230;killed four of my people and kidnapped another using advanced weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Weapons, sir?</blockquote>
<p>[An airman brings forwards a staff weapon and Hammond hands it to O'Neill.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
We can't figure out how they operate.</blockquote>
<p>[With confidence, O'Neill activates and then deactivates the weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Seen one before, I take it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>Yes, sir.<br />
(hands the weapon back)<br />
</p>
But there are no creatures like this on Abydos. Those people were human.  They were from Earth. Ra brought 'em there thousands of years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
I know all about that.  But your report said this Ra was in fact some kind of alien that lived inside a human body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, his eyes glowed.  That was our first clue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Are you sure he's dead, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Unless he could survive a tactical nuclear warhead blowing up in his face, I'm positive. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
These "people", or whatever they are, were guarding another man who retreated back through the Stargate. I got a good look at his eyes, Colonel. They glowed.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill looks shocked.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Hammond, O'Neill and Samuels are walking.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
How do you feel about the Stargate mission after all this time, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
How do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Well, it's been over a year. Has your perspective changed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, sir I&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill's voice trails off as he notes Ferretti and Kawalsky being led through another door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HAMMOND'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Was that&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Kawalsky and Ferretti yes, they were under your command on the first Stargate mission.  Tell me about Daniel Jackson, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[Through the window in Hammond's office, O'Neill watches Kawalsky and Ferretti in the briefing room.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Why are they questioning my men?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
They're not your men anymore, Colonel&#8212;you retired. Daniel Jackson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
You read the report?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
It's all there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What's this all about, General?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel was a scientist. He sneezed a lot. Basically he was a geek, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
So you didn't have a lot of time for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I didn't say that. He also saved my life and found the way home for my men and me&#8212;a little thing like that kinda makes a person grow on ya.  Know what I mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
According to the mission brief, your orders were to go through the Stargate, detect any possible threat to earth, and, if found, to detonate a nuclear device and destroy the 'gate on the other side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
But that's not what you did, is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Not right away. Ra's forces overpowered my team and took the weapon before I could arm it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
But with Doctor Jackson's help you eventually regained control and did in fact detonate the weapon. Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
To the best of your knowledge, Daniel Jackson and everyone else you knew on Abydos is dead, correct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(pausing slightly)<br />
</p>
That's correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>Good.<br />
(standing)<br />
</p>
Then you won't mind if I authorize a go ahead on our plan.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[They leave the office.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
This quartz material the Stargates are made of&#8212;it must be tough stuff if it can withstand a Mark III.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, we sent a robot probe through after we got back, sir.  It was flattened on the other end. Obviously, the Abydos Stargate had been buried in the rubble.</blockquote>
<p>[They enter the gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Well, somehow it got unburied.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[There is a bomb being prepped at the bottom of the Stargate ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Oh my God. You're sending another bomb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Mark V this time. If these creatures did reopen the Abydos Gate, we intend to reseal it for good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
General, you can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Countdown's already started&#8230;Unless you have something to add.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(after a long pause)<br />
</p>
General Hammond?  Sir?  I regret to inform you that my report was not entirely accurate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You didn't detonate the bomb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
No, I did detonate the bomb, sir, and it was aboard Ra's spacecraft, so it did kill him and eliminate the risk to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
However?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
However&#8230;Ra's ship was in orbit above the planet at the time.  Neither the 'gate nor anything else on the planet was destroyed. Daniel Jackson is alive and living with the people on Abydos.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You violated direct orders!  Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Because the people of Abydos are no threat to us! They deserve to be left alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
That's not up to you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
With all due respect, sir&#8212;if I'd come back here and reported the 'gate on the other side was still intact, we would have sent another bomb, just like you were about to. It wasn't necessary to let those people die. The threat from Ra was gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
What about the probe we sent through? It was crushed instantly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
After we came home, Daniel buried the 'gate in rocks, making my return or anybody else's impossible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Well, those four bodies lying in the infirmary say otherwise, Airman.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill sighs.  Hammond studies him for a moment, then turns to the bomb technicians.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
We'll send the bomb through on schedule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
General, you can't do that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Oh, I can't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
There are innocent people on that planet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
There are innocent people <i>here</i>! I have my orders too, Colonel.  I obey mine. Take Colonel O'Neill to the holding room.  Let's give him some time to think about things while I decide what to do with him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
<p>(to guards in room)<br />
</p>
Sergeant&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[After Hammond and Samuels leave, two airmen flank O'Neill.  He walks off between them.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOLDING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill is led inside and the door is shut. Kawalsky rises from one of the bunks and salutes crisply.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Colonel O'Neill, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I'm retired, Kawalsky.  Lose the salute.</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky drops his hand and shakes O'Neill's hand, smiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I appreciate that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Hey those kids on Abydos saved my life too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, the kids.</blockquote>
<p>[They sit at a table and chairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
They're the whole reason they kept the secret, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill pats Kawalsky reassuringly on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
That one kid idolized you, remember him? Weird name&#8230;what was it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Skaara.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Right. Remember how he was always saluting you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, my kid used to do that when he was little. Skaara kinda reminded me of him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Oh man, Colonel, you and me went through that whole mission together.  I never even knew you had a son.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, he died. Just before the Abydos mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
I'm sorry, sir, I had no idea.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens, and they stand as Hammond walks in.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
How many people did you say are on Abydos?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
That we saw?  Maybe five thousand. </blockquote>
<p>[Hammond looks down, deep in thought.  Kawalsky and O'Neill exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Does this mean you're reconsidering sending the bomb, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
It means I'm open to suggestions.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
I hate to throw a damper on your enthusiasm, but I still say the safest, most logical way to deal with this is to bury the Stargate, just like the ancient Egyptians did, and make it impossible for the aliens to return. It's the only way to eliminate the threat.</blockquote>

They know what we are now.  They know how far we've come.  We're a threat to them. They've got ships, General.  Ra had one as big as the great pyramids.  They don't need the Stargate to get here.  They can do it the old fashioned way. Now with all due respect to Mister Glass-is-half-empty over here, don't you think maybe we should use the Stargate to do a little reconnaissance before they decide to come back&#8230;again?</blockquote>

Well, Daniel, we don't have that long. What's it a map of?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, the cartouches seem to be separated clearly into groupings.  Each grouping is attached to the others with a series of lines.  And each grouping of glyphs contain seven symbols.  So you can see where this is going, of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Tell us anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
All of the symbols are on the Stargate in the Abydos chamber. I've also managed to chart some of them in the Abydos night sky, or at least pretty close. Jack, I think that this is a map of a vast network of Stargates&#8212;Stargates that are&#8230;are all over the galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh, I don't think that can be, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, because after Colonel O'Neill and his team came back, my team tried hundreds of symbol permutations using Earth as the point of origin, and it never worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I tried the same here, and it didn't work either.  But I figured the destinations I tried were either destroyed or buried.  But, um, I mean some of them somewhere must still exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Then where did your Ra lookalike come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Look I don't pretend to know anything about astrophysics but couldn't the planets change? I mean, uh, drift apart or something like that, to throw this map off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I knew I'd like you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
You mean I'm right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
According to the expanding universe model ,all bodies in the universe are constantly moving further apart&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So in the thousands of years since the Stargate was built&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All the coordinates could have changed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
But why does it still work between Abydos and Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Abydos is probably the closest planet in the network to Earth.  I mean the closer they are, the less the difference in relative position due to expansion&#8212;the further away, the greater the difference. In a few thousand more years, it won't work between Earth and Abydos either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Unless you can adjust for the displacement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Right, now with this map as a base, that should be easy. All we have to do is correct for Doppler's Shift.  Then I should be able to arrive at a computer model that can predict the adjustments necessary to get the 'gate working again.</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky and O'Neill exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Okay, so what did we just figure out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Any civilization advanced enough to build this 'gate network would be able to compensate for 50,000 years of stellar drift.</blockquote>

No, I can't. Nobody can. That's what I'm telling you.  Not for a&#8230;long time. Now as soon as we're gone, I want you to close it, bury it, put a big, heavy cover stone over it&#8212;nothing good can ever come through this 'gate. Do you understand me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABYDONIAN<br />
You came through, Daniel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Do you remember the story I told you?  How the ancient Egyptians back on Earth cut themselves off from Ra? Well that is exactly what you have to do. Then in one year&#8230;one year from this day you take the cover stone away.  I will try to bring Sha're home with me on that day. But if I don't make it back, if I don't return then you must bury the 'gate again forever, joa qua? You tell Sha're's father&#8212;in one year.</blockquote>

Not a hell of a lot, General. The Abydon boys who survived the attack on the base camp thought it was Ra.</blockquote>

Then who's coming through the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Gods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Not as in "God" god. Ra played a god, the sun god.  He borrowed the religion and culture of the ancient Egyptians he brought through the 'gate and then he used it to enslave them. You see, he wanted the people of Abydos to believe he was the only one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So you're saying Ra's not the last of his race after all?</blockquote>

Maybe he's got a brother Ray!</blockquote>

That's what we need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Wait a minute. The legend goes Ra's race was dying, he survived by taking over the body of his human host, an Egyptian boy.  But who's to say more of his kind couldn't do the same thing?  I mean, this could have happened any time, anywhere there's a 'gate. I mean this could be happening right now.</blockquote>

I'll take that as a maybe. Captain Carter, you're confident that Stargate will take us where we want to go with this new information?</blockquote>

Well, they're feeding the revised coordinates into the targeting computer right now. It'll take time to calculate but it should spit out two or three destinations a month.</blockquote>

With respect, sir, we can't bury our heads in the sand.  I mean think of how much we could learn, think of what we could bring back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
What you could bring back is precisely what I'm afraid of Captain. However the President of the United States happens to agree with you. In the event your theories pan out, he has ordered the formation of nine teams, whose duties will be to perform reconnaissance, determine threats and if possible to make peaceful contact with the peoples of these worlds. Now these teams will operate on a covert top secret basis.  No one will know of their existence except the President and the Joint Chiefs. Colonel O'Neill?</blockquote>

<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Earth. Chicago if you want to be specific.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Your words mean nothing. Where are you from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
<p>Uh, excuse me&#8230;<br />
(He draws a symbol on the ground)<br />
</p>
This is where we're from.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c scrapes a line through the symbol and walks away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, BASE CAMP, DAWN</b>
</p><p>[Kawalsky emerges from a tent in the windy clearing and looks at the horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Warren, let's go, rise and shine. The sun is&#8230;the suns are coming up. We're going to be all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
We can't go through another night like that, Captain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALKSI<br />
Yeah, gets a little chilly on this planet at night. The colonel should've sent us a radio message by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
When do you have to make your decision, whether or not to go back through the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
That'll be about when hell freezes over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
I think that pretty much describes our current situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
We are not leaving here without the colonel, is that understood? Another fine day on Planet Kawalsky.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;APOPHIS'S PALACE, HOLDING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill is testing the strength of bars on one of the room's windows. He climbs down to rejoin Skaara. Carter is sitting with Daniel a small distance away.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So Ra isn't dead after all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
No, it wasn't Ra. It was Apophis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Um, it's from Egyptian mythology. Ra was the sun god who ruled the day.  Apophis was the serpent guard, Ra's rival who ruled the night. It's right out of <i>The Book of the Dead</i>. They're living it.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill and Skaara walk the room's perimeters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SKAARA<br />
We will save Sha're?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I can't promise you anything at the moment&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SKAARA<br />
But you are a great warrior! We defeated Ra together!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I know, but take a look around here. Look what we're up against.</blockquote>
<p>[Skaara glares at O'Neill.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
 We'll try.</blockquote>
<p>[They move over to the others as the doors open and guards march in, led by Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Shaka ha! Kree hol mel, Goa'uld!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(to Skaara)<br />
</p>
What'd he say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SKAARA<br />
They're going to choose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Choose what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SKAARA<br />
Who will be the children of the gods.</blockquote>
<p>[A royal box is brought in, and Apophis emerges from it.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
Jaffa!</blockquote>
<p>[He helps Sha're out from the box.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Sha're. Jack, help me please.</blockquote>
<p>[He surges forward but Carter and O'Neill pull him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel, don't, don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Benna! Ya wan, ya daru! Kneel before your masters!</blockquote>
<p>[Guards move among the people making them kneel. O'Neill catches Teal'c's eye who gives him a look, asking him to kneel by his expression. O'Neill nods imperceptibly and kneels. Skaara does not yet.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Skaara.</blockquote>
<p>[Skaara kneels. Robed Goa'uld move among the prisoners.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Benna, ya wan ya daru! Choose!</blockquote>
<p>[A guards brings forth a prisoner and holds him up for the Goa'uld.]
</p>
<blockquote>GOA'ULD<br />
<p>No.<br />
(as the guards toss him aside, the Goa'uld moves to another)<br />
</p>
This one. We choose this one.</blockquote>
<p>[She is escorted away.  Other Goa'uld approach where SG-1 are kneeling and Daniel leaps forward, grabbing one of them. Guards prevent O'Neill from interfering.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GOA'ULD<br />
<p>(noting Daniel)<br />
</p>
This one is passionate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
How much would I remember if you chose me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[A guards taps O'Neill with a staff weapon in warning.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
<p>(distressed)<br />
</p>
Something of the host must survive.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c shakes his head negatively.  O'Neill notices.]
</p>
<blockquote>GOA'ULD<br />
We choose&#8230;him.</blockquote>
<p>[The Goa'uld points to Skarra.]
</p>
<blockquote>SKAARA<br />
<p>(he is grabbed)<br />
</p>
Na-nay, na nay! O'Neill! O'Neill!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Skaara! Skaara!</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill jumps forward but a guard hits him on the nose with a staff weapon. Skaara is dragged off, screaming O'Neill's name over and over.]
</p>
<blockquote>APOPHIS<br />
Kill the rest.</blockquote>
<p>[The prisoners scream and run to the back of the room as Apophis and the Goa'uld leave. Teal'c and his guards remain. They advance and ready their weapons, Teal'c at the front of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(to Teal'c)<br />
</p>
I can save these people! Help me! Help me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
<p>Many have said that.<br />
(He turns and fires on his own guards, than throws his weapon to O'Neill.)<br />
</p>
But you are the first I believe could do it!</blockquote>
<p>[A firefight ensues.  Carter pulls Daniel out of the line of fire with her.  O'Neill and Teal'c kill the guards and scare away the ones at the door. O'Neill heads back for the back wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(to fellow prisoners)<br />
</p>
Get out of the way!</blockquote>
<p>[The prisoners scatter and he fires at the wall, creating an opening. He checks it.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
All right, let's move!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Come on, come on!</blockquote>
<p>[The people stream through.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Come on, move, go, come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c drops his helmet to the floor in the empty holding room and looks at the dead Jaffa as O'Neill and Daniel help prisoners through the opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
You going to be okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel pauses, nods,  and leaves through the gap. O'Neill looks back to Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Hey, c'mon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
I have nowhere to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
For this you can stay at my place. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c looks around, then joins O'Neill.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What's your name?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Teal'c.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Teal'c, where will they take Skaara, the boy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
To the Stargate, after they've selected hosts for their children they will return home.</blockquote>
<p>[They follow the stream of prisoners heading for the 'gate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Hammond is in his office, overlooking the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Sir, they have just under an hour until the deadline. We should've heard from them by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
A lot can happen in an hour, Major.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, DAY</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill and SG-1 leads the prisoners at a fast pace.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
We've got less than an hour, how we doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We lost a few when we got to the forest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
They will be hunted down and killed. Anyone who does not exist to serve the gods is their enemy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
And that makes you&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
I am a Jaffa. Bred to serve, that they may live.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I&#8230;I don't understand.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c stops and reveals his pouch and his symbiote. The prisoners nearby scream.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What the hell is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
It is an infant Goa'uld, the larval form of the gods, I have carried one since I was a child, as all Jaffa carry one.</blockquote>
<p>[They resume their walk.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Get it out of there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
In exchange for carrying the infant Goa'uld until maturity, a Jaffa receives perfect health and long life. If I were to remove it, I would eventually die.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, well if I were you, I'd take my chances.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A ship flies down and hovers over the 'gate.  A small distance away O'Neill urges the prisoners over the crest of a hill.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
All right come on people, let's go, let's move!</blockquote>
<p>[They move.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
<p>(to O'Neill)<br />
</p>
The boy you seek is no longer who he was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I don't want to hear that.</blockquote>
<p>[At the Stargate, the ship's belly reveals a ring device which transports down Goa'ulds including Skaara, Apophis and Sha're. The ship flies off. As the prisoners and SG-1 near the 'gate, a Goa'uld glider swoops over them, readying its guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Take cover!</blockquote>
<p>[The ship fires as the prisoners scatter&#8212;O'Neill and Teal'c return fire but make no difference.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Colonel, we're sitting ducks here!</blockquote>
<p>[At the Stargate, Apophis dials out.]
</p><p>[Nearby, as O'Neill and Teal'c fire ineffectually at the ship, suddenly Warren fires a surface to air missile from a shoulder mounted firing device. It hits and destroys the ship. At the Stargate Apophis sees the explosion and steps through the Stargate. The prisoners cheer and O'Neill looks up to where the missile came from.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Kawalsky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Yeah!</blockquote>
<p>[SG-2 waves from the hill.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(turning to the prisoners)<br />
</p>
C'mon, folks, up the hill!</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky moves down to help O'Neill up.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Great shot! How many are there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
A dozen, maybe more. They're headed back through the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What about Skaara?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
He's with them. Colonel, we don't have much time before they lock us out.</blockquote>
<p>[They run up the hill with the others, Kawalsky taking a lead position.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Warren, Casey, on my right!</blockquote>
<p>[They position themselves at the crest of the hill, overlooking the Stargate. O'Neill sees Skaara about to enter the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
No. No.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs down the hill.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Colonel! Sir!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Skaara!</blockquote>
<p>[Skaara turns and smiles walking back toward O'Neill a few steps.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Skaara.</blockquote>
<p>[Skaara's smile disappears, his eyes glow, and he hits O'Neill with his hand device. O'Neill is thrown back and hits the ground as Skaara leaves and the 'gate deactivates. O'Neill gets to his feet as the others run down to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Did you see the symbols?</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill shakes his head.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Hammond is still overlooking the Gate Room. Samuels enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
<p>Sir the deadline has been reached.  Standing by to seal off Stargate, sir.<br />
(Hammond doesn't respond)<br />
</p>
Awaiting your order, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
In a minute, Major.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Warren and Casey are on the hill, looking back to the forest with binoculars when they spot movement.]
</p>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
<p>(into radio)<br />
</p>
Sir, we've got movement in the trees, a lot of movement in the trees. We've got hostiles, sir, hostiles closing in!</blockquote>
<p>[At the Stargate, Kawalsky takes control.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
<p>All right, people we're going on a little field trip. Daniel get busy on that Stargate, we've got company.<br />
(to Carter)<br />
</p>
Captain, arm your claymores. Me, Casey and Warren'll be the last men out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Negative. That's my job. Captain, help Daniel.  Once you've sent the signal I want you to go through, tell them we're bringing company.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone flocks to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
<p>(into his radio)<br />
</p>
Boys, give me an update!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
<p>(into his radio)<br />
</p>
Looks like a whole battalion, sir. 200 yards and closing.</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky readies the claymores as Carter stands with Daniel who is searching for the Stargate address in his notebook.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Doctor Jackson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I've got it, I know I have it here, I know I've got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[On the hill, the Warren and Casey fall to their bellies as they spy forces coming from the trees.]
</p>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
<p>(into radio)<br />
</p>
Sir, we've got hostiles coming out of the trees.</blockquote>
<p>[They start firing on the advancing Jaffa guards.]

</p><p>[Hammond and Samuels are still standing overlooking the Gate Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
All right. Seal it off, lock out their transmitters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Yes, sir!</blockquote>
<p>[He goes down the staircase.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel!</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel finally finds the address in his notebook.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
<p>(laughing)
</p>
Oh here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Go go!</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel starts dialling. On the hill the soldiers are being overpowered.]
</p>
<blockquote>WARREN<br />
<p>(into radio)<br />
</p>
We can't hold them, sir!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
<p>(to Carter)<br />
</p>
Send the signal as soon as it opens, Captain.</blockquote>
<p>[She holds her arm with the remote transmitter up.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(to Kawalsky)<br />
</p>
Pull 'em out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
<p>(into radio)<br />
</p>
Fall back, fall back!</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate opens.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Samuels runs up the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Sir, a wormhole has just been established on the other side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>(heading down the stairs)<br />
</p>
Belay my last order.  Do not seal the 'gate or lock out their transmitter codes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>(entering Control Room)<br />
</p>
Do we have a remote transmitter signal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
No signal yet, General.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Is it working?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh, let's hope so.  If not, I'll be the first to know.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[On the computer, the transmitter code has been received.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Oh wait, there it is.</blockquote>
<p>[They look to the Stargate and watch as the iris opens.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Warren and Casey run down the hill from their positions, towards the Stargate. They take defensive positions behind rock and continue firing on the guards as they reach the crest of the hill.  Carter steps through the 'gate, and Daniel starts to encourage the prisoners to go after her.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Come on, come on, come on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter rolls through the 'gate onto the ramp and stands, putting out a hand as two prisoners follow after her.  The soldiers around the 'gate raise their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hold your fire! They're refugees!</blockquote>
<p>[She helps them to their feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>(on the intercom)<br />
</p>
I hope you know what you're doing, Captain.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They are still firing against the guards as Daniel gets the last of the prisoners through the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Come on, please, two of you, two of you!</blockquote>
<p>[The guards step over the crest of the hill and O'Neill turns to Kawalsky.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Hit the claymores!</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky does so and they explode, taking a line of guards with them. He hits another and another and the guards go down in droves. But there are still more and one of the prisoners is hit by enemy fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Hurry!  Come on, come on. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.  We need cover here!</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky stands from his hiding place and screams, firing his weapon wildly. Daniel gets the last refugee through the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
<p>(to O'Neill)<br />
</p>
That's it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Go!</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel pauses for one reluctant second and then runs through the 'gate. ]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Daniel comes through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They behind you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I hope so.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kawalsky runs for the 'gate, as do the other soldiers.]
</p>
<blockquote>CASEY<br />
Go, go, go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Colonel, more hostiles, eight o'clock.</blockquote>
<p>[They retreat while firing on the encroaching guards. Casey is hit by a staff blast.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Casey!</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky and O'Neill move to him and drag him towards the 'gate, setting him down on the steps, always firing their weapons. One of the prisoners who had stayed wrestling a guard&#8212;squeezing him to death. The guard fall near to Kawalsky and its symbiote rises out of its pouch, it flies through the air and whips into Kawalsky's neck. He freezes, then groans, and it disappears into his neck. Teal'c and the prisoner leap through the 'gate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The prisoner jumps out of the 'gate and the soldiers cock their weapons, as Teal'c come through. Carter and Daniel call out simultaneously to stop them firing.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER AND DANIEL<br />
Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They're with us!</blockquote>
<p>[She walks up to Teal'c and receives his weapon from him with a nod.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill and Kawalsky pick up Casey and run through the 'gate&#8212;the guards are close on their heels and run through the 'gate after them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The three fall through the 'gate; Casey collapses to the ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Now! Lock it up, lock it up!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
<p>(over the intercom)<br />
</p>
Closing iris!</blockquote>
<p>[The iris closes, and they hear four metallic thuds as the guards that followed hit the metal. Then the sounds stop.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
<p>(over the intercom)<br />
</p>
Wormhole disengaged.</blockquote>
<p>[The iris opens. Medics rush up the ramp as they are called.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Medic! Medic!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
<p>(to Kawalsky, motioning to Casey)<br />
</p>
You got him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Yeah, I got him, thanks. Hold on here, get these people back.</blockquote>
<p>[The refugees surge forward and circle Carter and O'Neill, hugging and thanking them warmly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEDIC<br />
We've got to help these people, please.</blockquote>
<p>[Hammond walks up the ramp, amidst the confusion as Samuels clear the way for the medics.]
</p>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Let's go, man down, stand back! Stand back!</blockquote>
<p>[The medics lift Casey on to a stretcher.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEDIC<br />
Let's get him to the infirmary, let's get him inside.</blockquote>
<p>[They depart.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Colonel O'Neill. Care to explain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Um, we can use the Stargate to send these people home, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
<p>(motioning to Teal'c)
</p>
What's he doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
General Hammond, this is Teal'c. He can help us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Do you know what he is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes, sir I do, he's the man who saved our lives. And if you accept my recommendation, sir&#8230;he'll join SG-1.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
That decision may not be up to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
Stand back.  Let's get 'em off the ramp.</blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky is on his knees, looking a little distressed.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Kawalsky, are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAWALSKY<br />
Yeah, I'm good.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and regains his composure.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Colonel O'Neill, Major Kawalsky, this sure-to-be-very-interesting debriefing for SG units 1 and 2 will be at 0730.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SAMUELS<br />
All right, let's get these people situated.</blockquote>
<p>[They leave the Gate Room, leaving Teal'c, Carter, Daniel and O'Neill standing at the base of the ramp. Daniel looks back to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
She's out there somewhere, Jack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I know. So's Skaara.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So what do we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
We find 'em.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves, and the others follow.  Behind them, Kawalsky is still standing at the top of the ramp, almost inside the Stargate. He walks down the ramp towards the camera and as he gets close, his eyes glow.]
