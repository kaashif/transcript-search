   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 enters, wearing mission gear.]

     DANIEL
     So, what exactly are we going to see after this eclipse begins? I
     mean, it is black, and it is a hole...

     O'NEILL
     Well, it might be a black hole.

     DANIEL

     (Hesitates)
     Okay. Let me put that a different way

     CARTER

     (Interrupts, laughing)
     No Daniel, you're right. You can't exactly see it, not the
     singularity itself. It's so massive, not even light can escape it.
     But, during the totality phase of the eclipse, you should be able to
     see matter spiraling towards it.

     O'NEILL
     Actually, it's called the accretion disk.

     DANIEL

     Well, I guess it's easy enough to understand why the local
     population would be afraid of something like thi...
     (does a double take and looks at O'Neill)
     What did you just say?

     O'NEILL

     (Offhand)
     It's just an astronomical term.

     CARTER
     You didn't think the Colonel had a telescope on his roof just to
     look at the neighbors, did you?

     O'NEILL

     (draws in a breath and looks thoughtful)
     Not initially.

   [SG-1 goes through Stargate.]

   EXT--HARKA

   [We see green fields with windmills in the background. A dirt road
   leads to a sign reading:
   Welcome to Harka
   Project 169
   Douglas McLean
   Memorial Observatory
   SG7
   Planet PX8 987
   John Smith
   Commanding
   SG-1 walk down the dirt road.]

     TEAL'C
     Someone from SG-7 should have been here to greet us.

     O'NEILL
     They should be prepping the telescope for the big show.

   [As they walk, the team members spot a basket, then a body lying
   face-down at the side of the road. They rush to the body. O'NEILL turns
   it over, revealing an obviously dead man with sores on his exposed
   skin. They all draw back in reaction.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh, God. All right, MOPP 4.

   [SG-1's human members pull on hoods with air filters. O'NEILL breaks a
   sealed packet and scrubs his hands with an orange disinfectant towel.]

     O'NEILL

     Daniel, you and Teal'c check the village. See why no one's missed
     this guy. Where everyone else is. We've got the observatory.
     All right, move out!

   [O'NEILL and CARTER head down the road to the observatory, DANIEL and
   TEAL'C cut through the fields to village.]

   INT--OBSERVATORY ON HARKA

   [A large telescope fills the first room of the temporary structure.
   Machinery and computers line the walls. O'NEILL and CARTER walk in,
   O'NEILL using a flashlight to see.]

     CARTER
     Where is everyone?

   [O'NEILL and CARTER walk through a doorway into the barracks. The
   bodies of SG-7 are lying in various positions in the bunks and on the
   floor. The exposed skin of all of the men is covered with sores.]

     O'NEILL
     Found 'em.

     CARTER
     My God.

     DANIEL

     (distant, yelling)
     Jack! JACK!

   [DANIEL runs into the room, with TEAL'C at his heels.]

     DANIEL
     They're all dead. Everyone.

   END TEASER--OPENING CREDITS

   INT--BARRACKS ON HARKA

   [A glass decontamination chamber has been set up between the outside
   and the inside. SG-1 stand inside the chamber. A blast of steam or
   chemical solution washes over them. Inside, DR. FRAISER and two aides
   wait for SG-1 to finish their decontamination and enter.]

     FRAISER
     This complex has been totally decontaminated. How many dead?

     CARTER
     We estimate about a thousand.

     FRAISER
     Why didn't they send a message, some warning this was happening?

     O'NEILL
     We don't know.

     DANIEL
     Looks like all this happened very quickly.

     CARTER
     Now, there may still be survivors out there. Shouldn't we be looking
     for them?

     FRAISER
     No. Not until I examine you. We'll use the barracks room. Colonel,
     you said that you touched one of the victims before putting on
     gloves?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, but I washed my hands right away.

     FRAISER
     No. You're first.

   [DANIEL sneezes. Everyone stops, and turns to look at him.]

     O'NEILL

     Allergies, right?
     (to Fraiser)
     Right?

     FRAISER
     Right.

   EXT--HARKA

   [SG-1 walk down a dirt road, O'NEILL, DANIEL and CARTER clad in yellow
   biohazard suits and TEAL'C in his regular uniform.]

     CARTER
     We're supposed to tag the bodies we find with these.

   [CARTER and O'NEILL hand out tags.]

     DANIEL
     They knew this would happen.

     CARTER
     The indigenous people?

     DANIEL
     They told me when we came here three months ago that with the
     darkness would come the apocalypse. It was part of their mythology.
     But what do we tell them? That it's just an eclipse, and there's
     nothing to worry about.

   [Several bodies lay on the edge of a field and in the road. O'NEILL,
   DANIEL and TEAL'C start to tag the bodies. CARTER clips one tag on the
   body of a teenage boy. From the thick underbrush, a small hand reaches
   out and pulls off the tag, then runs away. The small figure can barely
   be seen moving through the brush, but CARTER spots it.]

     CARTER

     Hello? Hello, it's okay. You can come out. Look, I know I must look
     pretty scary in the mask, but I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay.
     (She turns to O'Neill)
     Colonel, there's someone in the bushes and they won't come out.

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     Show 'em your face.
     (He makes a face at Teal's frown.)
     Try to look friendly.

   [TEAL'C walks into the field. He spots CASSANDRA hiding in the trees.]

     TEAL'C

     We will not hurt you. Please come out.
     (He holds out his hand)
     Take my hand.

   [CASSANDRA hesitantly reaches out and takes his hand. TEAL'C smiles, a
   nice, gentle smile.]

     TEAL'C
     It is okay.

   [TEAL'C leads CASSANDRA back to the other members of SG-1. They share
   concerned glances.]

   INT--HARKA--OBSERVATORY BARRACKS

   [CASSANDRA sits on an examination table, her face blank. DR FRAISER and
   CARTER are examining her. Both wear cloth masks over their mouths and
   noses.]

     CARTER

     It's okay. Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. Can you hear
     me?
     You're very brave.
     (to Janet)
     Can I take this mask off?

     FRAISER

     (nods)
     I think that'll be okay. Looks like we're dealing with a bacteria
     infection. Just don't get too close.

     CARTER

     (Pulls off mask and smiles)
     There, that's better, huh? You feel like telling me your name now?
     (She gets a blank star from Cassandra, who then deliberately looks
     away.)
     That's okay. You remember my name? Samantha Carter. But you can call
     me Sam.

   [CASSANDRA hooks the tag she took off the dead boy on her hospital
   gown.]

     CARTER
     Oh no, no honey. You're not going to die. Why don't you just lay
     down and rest for awhile, okay? Okay.

   [CASSANDRA obediently lies down, tightly clutching the tag. CARTER
   reaches out and tries to pull it out of her hand. CASSANDRA pulls back,
   refusing to let it go. CARTER sighs and gives up, patting the girl on
   the head.]

     FRAISER

     (from across the room)
     This can't be.

     CARTER

     (walking over to her)
     She's infected, isn't she?

     FRAISER
     No, she's not.

     CARTER
     Well, what's wrong with her?

     FRAISER
     Three are traces of the element the Stargate is made of in her
     blood.

     CARTER
     Naquada?

     FRAISER

     Yes. Now, it's possible that's the reason she was able to resist the
     infection.
     (to technician, who gives her a folder)
     Thank you. Here, take a look.
     (Hands folder to Carter)

   [CARTER and FRAISER walk down the hall to the larger room. DANIEL,
   O'NEILL and TEAL'C are waiting.]

     FRAISER
     Well, I have some bad news. The samples my team collected show the
     entire area to be contaminated. It's in the water and the ground.
     Now, the bacteria doesn't seem to be airborne, but it has the unique
     ability to survive in a variety of environments.

     DANIEL
     Listen, um...I hate to sound self-centered here, but...

     FRAISER
     Your tests are fine.

     TEAL'C
     What of the girl?

     FRAISER
     No sign of infection, and as a precaution I did an ultrasound to
     make sure she wasn't parasitically infested with a Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     So, she goes back with us.

     CARTER
     Doctor, would it be safe for someone to stay a little while longer?
     I mean, we're safe right now, right?

     O'NEILL
     Captain?

     CARTER
     Sir, the eclipse happens in less than one day. This is our only
     opportunity to use this window of darkness to photograph the black
     hole with this telescope. It could change the course of human
     history. I don't want to belittle what's happened here, but if we
     just pack up and leave, SG-7 and all these people will have died for
     nothing.

   [CASSANDRA walks in and grabs CARTER'S arm, hiding behind her to peek
   out at the male members of SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, you won't be staying.

     TEAL'C
     I will remain. I am not at risk.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I'll stay too.

   EXT--HARKA STARGATE

   [Several technicians lead the way through the open wormhole. CARTER and
   DANIEL approach, with CASSANDRA between them, holding their hands. All
   are wearing biohazard suits.]

     CARTER

     (Bends down to look Cassandra in the eye.)
     Hey, you okay? Don't be afraid, I'll be holding your hand the whole
     way, all right? I know it looks kinda scary, but it's really a lot
     of fun.
     (She stands back up.)
     On three. One, two, three.

   [CARTER, CASSANDRA and DANIEL jump into the wormhole.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A small decontamination unit stands at the Gate, across the room a
   glassed chamber is between the Gate room and the rest of the Stargate
   complex.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (over intercom)
     Level one decontamination complete. Proceed with level two.

     CARTER

     (Removing Cassandra's helmet)
     Hey, it's okay, okay. It wasn't so bad, was it?

   INT--SGC--

   [Small, bare room. Concrete walls, one bed with gray cover, empty
   bookcase, gray chair. Depressing. CARTER and CASSANDRA enter.]

     CARTER
     Well, here we are. This is where you're going to stay for a little
     while, okay? I know it's nothing fancy, but we'll fix it up.

   [CASSANDRA looks around room, her expression dismayed. CARTER leads her
   to the bed. CASSANDRA sits down on the edge, CARTER crouches in front
   of her.]

     CARTER
     I have to go somewhere for a little while. But I promise you I won't
     be gone long, okay?

   [CASSANDRA grabs CARTER'S shirt and clenches it tightly in her hand.]

     CARTER
     No, I...I have to go. But I'll be able to see you the whole time
     through that camera up there, see?

   [CARTER points to the camera, then to her eyes. CASSANDRA just looks at
   her, refusing to relinquish her hold. CARTER gives up.]

     CARTER
     All right. I'll stay for a little while.

   [CARTER sits on the bed beside CASSANDRA. CASSANDRA clutches CARTER'S
   leg and skootches closer. CARTER looks uncomfortable, then puts one arm
   around the girl's shoulder.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [A monitor shows CARTER with CASSANDRA in her little cell. The room is
   now decorated with posters and pictures tacked to the wall. A small
   table and chairs have been added, with flowers on the table. An easel
   stands in the corner, and the bed is covered with a pink comforter
   decorated with bears. CASSANDRA is seated at the table, drawing.]

     HAMMOND

     (looks up from monitor)
     She seems to have bonded with Captain Carter

     DANIEL
     I can't blame her for being terrified. Believe me, it was not pretty
     over there.

     HAMMOND
     What happened?

     FRAISER
     We counted 1,432 dead. I believe we may be indirectly responsible.

     HAMMOND
     How?

     FRAISER
     It's possible someone from Earth brought a normally harmless
     bacteria to that planet. It learned some new traits from a local
     organism and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain I've
     ever encountered.

     HAMMOND
     Are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease
     back here with you?

     FRAISER
     Yes, sir. In fact, I think we may have brought back the cure.

     HAMMOND
     Doctor?

     FRAISER
     Sir, somehow this little girl survived against all odds on a
     completely contaminated planet. Now, I'm hoping she has some sort of
     natural immunity that we might use in fighting other serious
     infections already here on Earth.

     HAMMOND
     Why didn't the telescope team report that this outbreak was going
     on?

     DANIEL
     We don't know.

     DANIEL, HAMMOND and FRAISER all look at monitor, which fades to...

   INT--SGC--CASSANDRA'S ROOM

     CARTER

     Don't you want this?
     (Gestures to a plate of hot dogs in buns.)
     See, we usually put some stuff on it, like this.
     (She puts on mustard and takes a big bite.)
     See? Mmmm.

   [CASSANDRA looks away, taking a furtive bite from a small plain hot dog
   hidden in her hand. She returns to her drawing. It's a picture of
   figures lying on the ground. A smaller figure with a dress and dark
   hair stands over them, tears dripping down her face. CARTER looks at
   the drawing, then picks up a paintbrush and draws a larger stick figure
   beside the solitary standing girl.]

     CARTER
     It's me, okay? You're not alone anymore

   [CASSANDRA looks up at her solemnly.]

   INT--HARKA OBSERVATORY

   [O'NEILL is sitting on the telescope ladder, TEAL'C is in an office
   chair. Both appear bored.]

     O'NEILL

     This is fun.
     (He looks at his watch)
     Only eight hours to go. Sweet

     TEAL'C
     I still do not understand this black hole

     O'NEILL
     Well, a black hole is..is really big, thing. It's uh...But basically
     it's a massive hole. Out there.

     TEAL'C
     I see.

     O'NEILL
     Ah, and...what happens is, everything gets sucked into it, even
     light. That's why we can't see it. It just gets...sucked in.

     TEAL'C
     Thank you.

     O'NEILL
     Sure.

   INT--SGC CASSANDRA'S ROOM

   [CARTER is sitting on the bed, CASSANDRA lying asleep, across her lap.
   She is stroking the girl's hair. DANIEL walks in. He looks at CARTER
   and mimes a phone call. She nods, and looks down at CASSANDRA as she
   wakens.]

     CARTER

     Hey. How you feeling?
     (Cassandra blinks sleepily.)
     Listen, I have to go somewhere for a little while. But you're not
     going to be alone.
     (She looks towards Daniel.)
     Daniel's going to be here the whole time. Remember Daniel?

   [DANIEL smiles. CASSANDRA looks sad.]

     CARTER
     You're very brave, remember. I'll be back before you know it.

     CASSANDRA
     Please don't go.

   [CARTER and DANIEL both look surprised as they look down at CASSANDRA.]

     CARTER
     You feel like telling me your name?

     CASSANDRA
     Cassandra.

     CARTER

     (Smiles)
     Hi, Cassandra.

     CASSANDRA

     (Looking exhausted)
     I hurt.

     CARTER

     (Anxiously)
     Where?

   [CASSANDRA taps her chest.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [CASSANDRA is on examination table.]

     FRAISER
     Sounds good. No fluid in her lungs.

     CARTER
     She described it more like a sharp, stabbing pain.

     FRAISER

     (Walks across the room to computer, Carter following.)
     I have no idea of what to say or do. Her latest blood work shows a
     marked potassium deficiency. I have no idea what is causing it or
     how it got so low, so quickly, but one of the effects can be
     arrhythmia.

     CARTER
     You're sure she doesn't have the disease?

     FRAISER
     Uh-hm. Positive. These are not the symptoms of a bacterial
     infection.

   [CASSANDRA looks over at them.]

     CARTER

     Okay, thank you.
     (She crosses back over to Cassandra and lifts her off the table.)
     All right, let's go back to our room

     CASSANDRA

     (to Fraiser)
     Thank you.

     FRAISER
     You are welcome.

   [As they cross the room, CASSANDRA stops short, a look of pain crossing
   her face. She crosses her arms over her chest.]

     CARTER
     What? What? What is it?

   [CASSANDRA'S eyes go wide, then she collapses backwards. CARTER scoops
   her up.]

     FRAISER
     Get her on the table!

   [CARTER puts her on the table. FRAISER feels her neck for a pulse.]

     CARTER
     Oh my God. What is it? What's happening?

     FRAISER

     She's got an irregular heartbeat. She's in arrest.
     (Runs to intercom and yells.)
     Code Blue to lab. Code blue!

     CARTER
     What? What do I do?

   [FRAISER starts CPR. A team of medical personnel run in and starts
   working.]

     FRAISER
     We've got a cardiac arrest, potassium deficiency. Get me a number
     seven-cuff intubation tracheal tube now.

   [The technicians do their medical stuff. CARTER pulls back to give them
   room. The monitor registers no heartbeat as they insert a tube and
   continue with chest compressions.]

     FRAISER
     Defib. Stop CPR. Defib. Sixty joules. Come on, come on. Clear!

   [The nurse tries the paddles to get CASSANDRA'S heart going. Her
   heartbeat starts.]

     FRAISER
     Let me in, let me in.

     TECHNICIAN
     Check the monitor.

     FRAISER
     I want you to notify the ICU. I want her potassium level rechecked,
     stat.

     TECHNICIAN
     Get on it. Get down to the lab.

     FRAISER
     Wait. Wait...wait....wait...wait. Oh my God.

     CARTER
     What is it?

     FRAISER
     Get me a chest x-ray, stat.

     FRAISER
     I don't know. Listen.

   [FRAISER hands her stethoscope to CARTER. CARTER puts it on and
   listens. Underneath the sound of CASSANDRA'S heartbeat, there's a
   shushing sort of mechanical sound. CARTER and FRAISER exchange worried
   glances.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [FRAISER puts up and X-ray of CASSANDRA'S chest. There's some kind of
   small round object embedded in her heart, with tendrils branching out.
   HAMMOND, DANIEL, CARTER and FRAISER all stand there, looking at it.]

     CARTER
     Oh my God.

     HAMMOND
     What is it?

     FRAISER
     I don't know, but it wasn't there ten hours ago.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY OPERATING ROOM

   [CASSANDRA is on the table, surrounded by medical personnel. They are
   obviously about to attempt to remove the object.]

     WARNER
     I'm inserting the scope. Image up.

   [An image of CASSANDRA'S heart is projected on the monitor.]

     FRAISER
     Pulse normal.

     WARNER
     I'd advancing the scope.

     FRAISER
     Pulse is rising.

     WARNER
     Adjusting view.

   [The monitor shows a round object in CASSANDRA'S heart.]

     FRAISER
     Well, parts of it are definitely organic.

     WARNER
     I'm going to move in closer and try to get a biopsy.

   [CASSANDRA'S heartbeat speeds up.]

     FRAISER
     Pulse is now 140.

     WARNER
     I'm scraping the heart surface for samples.

     FRAISER
     We have to stop.

     WARNER
     Just a little more.

   [CASSANDRA'S heartbeat speeds up more, then flatlines.]

     WARNER

     (pulling back with alarm)
     Removing scope. Prepare the paddles!
     Charging. Clear!

   [The medical staff charge the paddles, but just as they are about to
   use them, CASSANDRA'S heartbeat returns to normal.]

     FRAISER
     Wait, wait. Pulse is normal

   INT--SGC

   [HAMMOND and FRAISER move through corridors.]

     FRAISER
     Whatever this object is, it has the ability to stop her heart in an
     instant.

     HAMMOND
     Can you remove it?

     FRAISER
     No. It doesn't look like it. Not without killing her. Now, Dr.
     Warner managed to get us some samples. I'm hoping the results of the
     analysis will tell us more about what this object is.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you Doctor.

   INT--SGC CASSANDRA'S ROOM

   [CASSANDRA is in bed, sleeping. CARTER is sitting beside her.]

     CASSANDRA

     (waking up)
     Mom?

     CARTER
     Hey. You okay?

     CASSANDRA
     I was dreaming about my mom.

     CARTER
     You miss your mom very much?

     CASSANDRA

     (looks away.)
     I'm tired.

     CARTER
     Well, you should get some rest. Don't worry, everything's going to
     be just fine. And when you get better, I promise you I am going to
     show you all kinds of really wonderful things about this planet.

     CASSANDRA
     Promise?

     CARTER
     You bet.

   [CASSANDRA reaches up and hugs her. CARTER looks sad.]

   INT--SGC HALLWAY OUTSIDE CASSANDRA'S ROOM

   [DANIEL is sitting in a chair, obviously waiting, as CARTER exits the
   room.]

     DANIEL
     How is she?

     CARTER
     She's fine. Sleeping.

     DANIEL
     Um. Um, if you want...I can sit with her tomorrow. For a few hours.

     CARTER
     No, I'm okay.

     DANIEL
     Okay.

     CARTER
     I just...I want to do this.

     DANIEL
     Okay. But I guess what I'm saying is that you don't have to do this
     alone.

     CARTER

     Thanks.
     (She rubs Daniel's arm before walking away.)

   INT--OBSERVATORY ON HARKA

   [The singularity is starting.]

     O'NEILL

     It's showtime!
     (Jack climbs to telescope.)

     TEAL'C
     The systems are online. The eclipse has reached its totality.

     O'NEILL

     (Awed)
     Whoa.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY LAB

   [CARTER and DANIEL are looking at new X-ray.]

     CARTER
     The layer of fatty tissue between the two sides of the object is
     decaying. Very slowly, mind you, but still...

     DANIEL
     What's the significance?

     CARTER
     I'm about to do an experiment to find out. One side of the object is
     made up of a combination of iron and potassium; the other side is
     made up of the element that makes up the Stargate.

     DANIEL
     What?

     FRAISER
     Uh-hm. I'm assuming it's the Naquada that was in her blood. Somehow
     the object is collecting it.

     CARTER
     Now, potassium can be one of the most volatile alkaline metals on
     Earth. Combined with even a small concentration of Naquada, and...

     DANIEL
     That doesn't sound very good.

   [The monitor shows two robot arms in small room.]

     CARTER
     The room you're looking at is in the sub-basement floor of the
     complex. It's lead sealed. Let's see what happens when we put the
     two objects together.

   [CARTER types some commands into computer.]

     DANIEL
     Where are the samples?

     CARTER
     I'm only using a microscopic particle of each.

   [The two robot arms move closer together and...**BOOM** The monitor
   screen shows grey snow.]

     FRAISER
     The reading's off the scale. Gamma and particle radiation.

     DANIEL
     Are we safe?

     CARTER
     Yeah, but we have a big problem.

     DANIEL
     Well, if two microscopic particles can cause that...

     CARTER
     Then the object inside Cassandra could cause a nuclear reaction a
     million times bigger.

   [All three look worried.]

   INT--OBSERVATORY ON HARKA

   [O'NEILL is looking through the telescope when he notices a pulsing
   light approaching.]

     O'NEILL
     What is that?

     TEAL'C
     A star, perhaps.

     O'NEILL
     Hit the zoom.

   [The screen becomes a blur.]

     O'NEILL
     No, it's way too close to be a star. Pull back.

   [The object is revealed to be some kind of spaceship.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell is that?

     TEAL'C
     It is a Goa'uld attack vessel.

   [O'NEILL looks quickly at TEAL'C.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [HAMMOND, DANIEL, CARTER, FRAISER and four officers in dress uniforms
   sit around the briefing table.]

     DANIEL
     It's a setup. It has to be. The Goa'ulds wiped out every last living
     person on that planet except Cassandra, and then they made us think
     that it was our fault; because they knew that we wouldn't leave her
     there. They knew that we would bring her back here. And they used
     their technology to put that thing inside of her.

     CARTER
     It's like they designed a way for us to help them create the device
     after she came through the Stargate. So we wouldn't detect it until
     it was too late.

     FRAISER
     We gave her iron supplements. We may even have turned the device on
     with a jolt of electricity when we resuscitated her.

     HAMMOND
     You're saying it's meant to destroy us.

     CARTER
     At least this complex; a threat to the Goa'uld. The Stargate.

     DANIEL
     They used that little girl like a Trojan Horse.

     HAMMOND
     How long do we have?

     FRAISER
     One hour and fifty-two minutes.

     HAMMOND
     You can predict it that accurately?

     FRAISER
     The cellular decay of the tissue Dr. Warner sampled appears to be
     happening like clockwork.

   [Everyone turns to look at HAMMOND, who looks grim.]

   INT--SGC CASSANDRA'S ROOM

   [CASSANDRA tosses and turns in bed. CARTER is watching at the door.
   DANIEL enters behind her. CASSANDRA coughs in her sleep. Both adults
   watch her.]

     CARTER
     How could they do this?

     DANIEL
     Well, to the Goa'uld, she's not as we see her. She's a tool. Her
     death is a very cheap way to get rid of us.

     CARTER

     (with tears in her eyes.)
     I know I'm supposed to be detached.

     DANIEL

     (Looks at her with concern.)
     Who said that?

     CARTER
     Sometimes I forget you're not military.

   INT--OBSERVATORY ON HARKA

   [The monitor shows the approaching ship.]

     TEAL'C
     It is the ship of the Goa'uld Nirti. An enemy of Apophis.

   [An object leaves the ship.]

     O'NEILL
     Now, what the hell is that?

     TEAL'C

     (Looks grim)
     We must go.

   INT--SGC GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [HAMMOND hangs up the red phone.]

     CARTER
     Look, Sir, I know this decision isn't easy for you.

     HAMMOND
     In fact, the decision is quite easy. The consequences are what's
     difficult.

     CARTER
     There has to be another way.

     HAMMOND
     I've been assured there is absolutely no way to remove the object
     from the girl without killing her. Therefore, we have no choice.
     According to Dr. Fraiser's measurements, the rate of atomic decay,
     we have one hour and twenty minutes left. The girl should be
     prepared to go back through the Stargate.

     CARTER
     I'll take her, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Along with SG-4. I want O'Neill and Teal'c to return with you.

   EXT--HARKA

   [O'NEILL in biohazard suit and TEAL'C are running down road. Overhead,
   a pair of Death Gliders shoot at them. Blasts come close; they throw
   themselves to the side of the road.]

     TEAL'C
     We must get to the Stargate!

     O'NEILL
     No argument from me!

     TEAL'C
     This Goa'uld Nirti, he once sent an emissary of peace to negotiate a
     treaty concerning a Stargate Apophis had taken control of. The
     negotiation was a ploy. The Stargate was destroyed.

     O'NEILL
     How?

     TEAL'C
     As soon as he entered the Stargate, there was a massive explosion.

     O'NEILL
     The girl?

     Teal'c nods.

   INT--GATE ROOM

   [SG-4 and CARTER are dressed in biohazard suits. CARTER is holding
   CASSANDRA (also in suit) by the hand.]

   EXT--HARKA

   [Death Gliders are firing at O'NEILL and TEAL'C. They run towards
   Stargate.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron three, encoded. Chevron four, encoded.

   [CASSANDRA looks up at CARTER; her eyes roll back, and she collapses.]

     CARTER
     Cassandra?

   [FRAISER runs to Gate room.]

   EXT--HARKA--TEAL'C works on dialing the DHD

     O'NEILL
     Take your time, don't hurry.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [FRAISER runs in, and drops down at CASSANDRA'S side.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Chevron five, encoded.

     CARTER
     What is it?

     FRAISER
     She's slipped into a coma.

     CARTER
     What?

     TECHNICIAN

     Chevron six, en...
     (he stops and looks down at the computer. The wormhole engages.)

     HAMMOND
     Close the iris.

     TECHNICIAN
     No need, sir. I'm getting an SG-1 remote signal.

   EXT--HARKA

   [TEAL'C and O'NEILL jump through Stargate and into the wormhole.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [TEAL'C and O'NEILL come through the Gate, debris following them.]

     O'NEILL
     Get the girl away from the Gate!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     O'NEILL
     So the Goa'ulds kept SG-7 from coming back through to warn us. All
     part of the plan.

     DANIEL
     So what are we going to do now?

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c; Dr. Fraiser says the device inside the girl is on some sort
     of timer. You're sure it will go off if we send the girl through the
     Stargate?

     TEAL'C
     We should not attempt it. The Earth Gate is what the Goa'uld wish to
     destroy.

     CARTER
     Cassandra's condition deteriorated once she got near the Stargate.

     HAMMOND
     Well, I can't risk the security of this mountain. We'll have to take
     her somewhere else.

     O'NEILL
     What about the abandoned nuclear facility in...

     HAMMOND

     (interrupting)
     Right. It's just twenty minutes away.
     (Picks up phone)
     This is Major General Hammond. Get me the Secretary of Defense
     immediately. Tell him it's a matter of life and death.

   EXT--ROAD TO ABANDONED NUCLEAR FACILITY

   [SG-1 is in back of a military transport, CASSANDRA being held on
   CARTER'S lap. They reach the facility, and various military personnel
   lead SG-1 into the building. CARTER is carrying a comatose CASSANDRA.
   The group walks through several corridors before reaching an elevator.]

     O'NEILL
     I can take her from here now, Captain.

     CARTER
     No Sir, that's okay.

   [The elevator door opens.]

     O'NEILL
     This elevator goes down thirty floors through solid rock. Takes
     about three minutes to get to the bottom. That gives you four
     minutes to start back up.

   [CARTER nods and enters the elevator, still carrying CASSANDRA.]

   INT--FACILITY ELEVATOR

   [CASSANDRA stirs, then her eyes open. She looks around the elevator,
   then at CARTER.]

     CASSANDRA
     Where are we going?

     CARTER

     (looking horrified.)
     Please, go back to sleep.

     CASSANDRA
     I'm not tired anymore.

   [CARTER puts her down; CASSANDRA looks up at her.]

     CASSANDRA
     Are you crying?

   [CARTER has tears in her eyes.]

   INT--UPPER LEVEL OF FACILITY

   [DANIEL, O'NEILL and TEAL'C watch the numbers on the elevator panel.]

   INT--FACILITY ELEVATOR

   [Elevator reaches bottom. CARTER leads CASSANDRA out into corridor.
   CARTER opens a heavy door, and leads CASSANDRA into bare, concrete
   room. The walls are crumbling. Nothing is inside. There's a slab of
   concrete jutting out of the wall. CARTER sits CASSANDRA on it.]

     CARTER
     Sit down here and rest for awhile, okay? I have to go.

     CASSANDRA
     You promised you'd never leave me alone.

     CARTER

     I'll be back, okay? I'll be back.
     (Brushes back Cassandra's hair.)
     You're very brave, remember?

     CASSANDRA
     I'm very brave.

   [CARTER is crying.]

     CARTER
     I have to close the door.

   [CASSANDRA nods. CARTER walks out of the room.]

     CASSANDRA

     (As the door swings shut, she stands)
     Sam?

   [CARTER shuts the door.]

     CASSANDRA

     (muffled, through door)
     SAM?

   [CARTER leans against door, crying, then runs into elevator and presses
   the button to go up. She hits the walls, kicks them, then slides to the
   ground, sobbing. She suddenly stops, pulls herself up, and changes the
   direction of the elevator.]

   INT--UPPER LEVEL FACILITY

   [DANIEL is the only one still watching the elevator panel, so he is the
   only one to see the numbers change.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, she's going back down.

     O'NEILL
     The hell she is. Captain Carter? Captain Carter.

   INT--LOWER LEVEL FACILITY

   [CARTER opens the door and joins CASSANDRA in the room.]

     O'NEILL

     (Over speaker)
     Sam, do you read me?

     CARTER
     Colonel, I'm staying.

   INT--UPPER LEVEL FACILITY

     O'NEILL
     Negative.

     CARTER

     (on speaker)
     Colonel, she's awake.

     DANIEL
     Oh, God.

   INT--LOWER LEVEL

   [CARTER pulls the door shut and turns the lock.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain Carter, I am ordering you to get back up here, right now.
     Right now.

   [CARTER hugs CASSANDRA.]

     CASSANDRA
     Are we going to die?

     CARTER
     No, we are not going to die.

   INT--UPPER LEVEL FACILITY

     O'NEILL
     All right, why don't you guys clear out.

   [DANIEL and TEAL'C exchange a look, then turn back to O'NEILL.]

     O'NEILL

     (nods)
     Right.

   INT--LOWER LEVEL FACILITY

   [CARTER and CASSANDRA are holding onto each other very tightly.]

     CASSANDRA

     We're both very brave. I love you.

     CARTER
     I love you too.

   INT--UPPER LEVEL FACILITY

   [O'NEILL is watching the seconds count down on his watch.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, here we go. Three...two...one...

   [O'NEILL'S watch reaches zero. Nothing seems to happen.]

     DANIEL
     I don't feel anything.

     O'NEILL
     We could have been wrong about the time.

     DANIEL
     We could have been wrong about what would happen.

     O'NEILL

     (Presses intercom)
     Captain Carter? Can you hear me?
     (pauses)
     Sam, can you hear me?

   INT--LOWER LEVEL OF FACILITY

     CARTER

     (into intercom)
     We're okay. Nothing happened. Cassandra's fine, I'm fine. It didn't
     happen. I just...I couldn't leave her Sir.

     O'NEILL
     How did you know, Captain?

     CARTER
     It occurred to me that she first slipped into the coma when we
     brought her closer to the Stargate. As soon as we got her far enough
     away from the Stargate, she woke up. And I...knew.

     O'NEILL
     You knew.

   INT--UPPER LEVEL FACILITY

   [DANIEL punches TEAL'C in the arm. TEAL'C looks at him like he's nuts.]

   INT--LOWER LEVEL FACILITY

   [CARTER crosses room to CASSANDRA, who jumps up and wraps her legs
   around CARTER'S waist. They hug again.]

   EXT--PARK

   [DANIEL and CARTER are swinging CASSANDRA between them. TEAL'C is
   following. All are dressed in civilian clothing.]

     DANIEL
     You're getting a little heavy for this.

     O'NEILL

     (Calls from across park, where he's carrying a dog.)
     Cassandra!

     CARTER
     Hey, there he is.

     CASSANDRA

     (Running across to O'Neill)
     What's that?

     O'NEILL
     We have a rule here on Earth. Every kid has got to have a dog. This
     is a dog. And he's yours.

   [O'NEILL hands the dog to CASSANDRA. CARTER, DANIEL and TEAL'C are
   sitting on a picnic table, watching O'NEILL and CASSANDRA interact.]

     DANIEL
     So, how sure were you really?

     CARTER
     I can't explain it, Daniel; I just knew.

     TEAL'C
     Mother's instinct, perhaps.

     CARTER

     (Grins.)
     Subtle, but no.
     Dr. Fraiser is going to take her until we can find qualified
     parents.

     DANIEL
     By qualified, you mean ones with the right security clearance.

     CARTER
     I wouldn't be surprised if Dr. Fraiser wants to keep her for
     herself. As long as Cassandra's happy.

     TEAL'C
     She appears to be.

     CARTER

     And I wasn't completely at ease until I learned the object was
     shrinking and being reabsorbed into her system.
     (Cassandra comes over, carrying the dog.)
     Hey!

     CASSANDRA
     Hey Samantha. See my new dog?

     CARTER
     Wow. Your new dog?

     CASSANDRA
     It's an Earth rule. Every kid has to have one. But I don't mind.

   [CARTER raises her eyebrows and looks at O'NEILL.]

     O'NEILL

     Why don't I take the dog for a little walk.
     (He takes the dog out of Cassandra's arms.)
     C'mere. Teal'c? You know anything about dogs?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing.

   [O'NEILL gestures, and TEAL'C and DANIEL follow him.]

     CASSANDRA
     When you find me a new home, will you come and visit me?

     CARTER
     You betcha. All the time.

     CASSANDRA
     That is, when you're on Earth.

     CARTER
     Right. Now, about that Cassandra...

     CASSANDRA
     I know. The Stargate is a secret; and I was born in a place
     called...Toronto?

     CARTER
     Right.

   [CARTER and CASSANDRA share a smile of complete understanding.]

     CASSANDRA

     (Looks across park at swing set.)
     What are those?

     CARTER
     Ah. Those are swings.

     CASSANDRA
     I never had any of those...in Toronto. They look like fun.

     CARTER
     They are. Come on.

   [Hand in hand, CASSANDRA and CARTER head for the swings.]
