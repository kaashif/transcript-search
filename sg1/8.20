   BEGIN NEW EPISODE

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR. LEVEL 22

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (agitated)
     Look, the only reason you have the Stargate is 'cause of us.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     I'm aware of that.

     ALTERNATE JACKSON
     I'm a linguist. By all accounts, your team may need one.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Ahh... what if something goes wrong with the gate on the other end?

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     Neither of you have had any military training whatsoever. Have
     either one of you ever even fired a weapon of any kind?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Well... unless you count launching a rocket.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND

     Look, I'm sorry.
     (sliding his access card into the elevator call reader)
     Your expertise may be needed some time in the future, but for now--

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Well, can I ask who is going?

   [The elevator doors open to reveal Alternate Jack O'Neill in civilian
   clothes. He gives them all a look.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Alternate Hammond enters with Alternate O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel
   trailing behind him.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (to Alternate O'Neill)
     I don't understand. What made you change your mind?

   [Four Air Force men are seated at the briefing room table, dressed in
   fatigue uniforms and with their backs to Alternate Hammond and the
   others. The nearest one spins around in his chair. It is Alternate
   Kawalsky.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (standing and smiling)
     Hi, Jack.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     That's 'Colonel', Major.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     You're retired.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (somewhat irritated)
     I was.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     I take it you two know each other.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah, we served together a long time ago.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Oh, it wasn't that long ago.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     Major Kawalsky has been assigned to assemble the team that will go
     through the Stargate.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     And you knew I couldn't say no if he was involved.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     Oh, come on, Colonel. You don't owe me anything. Admit it, you gotta
     be a little curious.
     Traveling to a different planet, through a wormhole.

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (smiling)
     I know I am.

   [Alternate O'Neill gives her a look.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (to Hammond)
     Sir, with all due respect, what are they still doing here?

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND

     I'm not sure.
     (to the airmen guarding the door)
     Airmen, please escort--

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. We were all on that tape.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     That tape had nothing to do with it. Jack O'Neill's one of the best
     I've ever served with.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     You may not care that this timeline is a direct result of tampering
     with the past, but you have to acknowledge that the tape said the
     planet you're going to is enemy territory. An enemy that is way more
     advanced than us technologically.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     What's your point?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     You're literally walking into a totally alien situation, outmanned
     and outgunned.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Do we have a choice?

   [Alternate Carter and Daniel exchanged bemused looks as Alternate
   Hammond and O'Neill look on.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC LABORATORY

   [Alternate O'Neill is looking into the Puddle Jumper from outside the
   front window. Alternate Carter and Daniel join him.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We've only been able to activate the interior lights and the dialing
     computer. But, according to the tape, you have the gene that can
     make this ship fly.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     And travel through time.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Well, presumably you don't have to do that if you don't want to.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Huh.

   [He walks around to the rear ramp of the ship and enters, Alternate
   Carter and Daniel following him. He walks forward to the pilot seats
   and looks around.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     What do I do?

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (indicating the pilot's seat to their left)
     Sit down.

   [Alternate O'Neill sits in the seat and slides it forward. Alternate
   Daniel sits in the other seat and Alternate Carter stands beside
   him.</blockquote>

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Now what?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     You're supposed to have the ability to fly this thing.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     With your mind.

   [Alternate O'Neill moves a control in each hand, but nothing happens.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Try not to think about the past.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Or the future.

   [O'Neill nods in a doubtful way then closes his eyes. The console
   beside him begins to glow and hum. Outside the ship, the technicians
   note the change and turn to look at the ship as the humming increases.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Oh, you so have to let us go with you.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Please.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Puddle Jumper is sitting in front of the Stargate. Alternate
   Kawalsky and his team and Alternate O'Neill, Daniel, and Carter are
   dressed in camouflage uniforms and prepared to embark. Alternate
   Kawalsky and his men are wearing helmets, while Alternate Daniel and
   Carter are holding theirs.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (referring to Alternate Carter and Daniel's helmets)
     Put those on.

   [They do so but Alternate O'Neill puts on a brown baseball-style cap
   instead.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (to Alternate O'Neill)
     How come we have to wear these and you don't?

   [O'Neill runs his hands off the end of his cap but doesn't respond.
   Hammond arrives.]

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     Okay, people. Let me remind you: this mission's recon only. Do not
     engage the enemy. I'm allowing the use of this ship because of the
     obvious tactical advantage it provides you. Under no circumstances
     is it to be used to travel through time, understood?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND

     Never in my life would I have imagined giving that order.
     (to Alternate O'Neill, referring to Alternate Daniel and Carter)
     Are you absolutely certain about them, Colonel?

   [Alternate O'Neill looks them over then looks again at Hammond.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     No, sir.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     Good luck, and godspeed.

   [He walks away.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     All aboard.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [They all board the ship. Alternate O'Neill sits in the pilot's seat
   while Alternate Kawalsky takes the co-pilot seat with Alternate Daniel
   and Carter behind them. The rest of Alternate Kawalsky's team sits in
   the rear compartment.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (to Kawalsky)
     Hey. Watch this.

   [He cockily puts his hands on the panel in front of him and everything
   lights up.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (turning to Alternate Daniel)
     Oh, by the way, you do have the address to get us back home,
     correct?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Yeah.

   [Alternate Carter nods as well.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Good. Dial it up.

   [Alternate Daniel steps up to the dialing panel and hits the first
   symbol. The gate spins in response. The gate continues to spin to
   subsequent symbols of the address.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Alternate Hammond and Alternate McKay are looking on as the gate
   spins.]

     ALTERNATE MCKAY
     I give this no more than a fifty-fifty chance of working.

     ALTERNATE HAMMOND
     Well, according to the tape, it worked for eight years.

     ALTERNATE MCKAY
     Hmm.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Daniel pushes the last symbol and the button at the base of
   the dialing device. The Stargate opens. Everyone is amazed.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Wow.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     ALTERNATE MCKAY
     Well, I'm certainly glad it's not me going through that, uh...
     thing.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (to Alternate Carter)
     Any idea what to expect?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Not really. According to the tape, we're going to be
     de-molecularized, transmitted over two thousand light years through
     subspace, and then, uh, re-materialized on the other side.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     I did not need to know that.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Okay.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     ALTERNATE MCKAY

     (into microphone)
     Gateship One, you're go for launch.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (displeased)
     'Gate Ship'?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (making a flying motion with his hand)
     Well, it's a ship, it goes through the gate, so...

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (accepting that)
     All right.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Alternate Hammond is looking at Alternate McKay with a stern and
   irritated expression.]

     ALTERNATE MCKAY
     What? It's a ship that goes through the gate: it's a gateship. Well,
     I thought it was clever.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill takes the hand controls. The ship moves quickly into
   the wormhole and travels through it.]

   EXT--CHULAK, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper comes rushing out of the wormhole and curves upward
   into the sky, its engine pods extending and activating. The team is
   seen through the viewscreen.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The viewscreen shows forests passing below and mountains in the
   distance.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, that was cool.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     I didn't feel anything.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Doesn't even feel like we're pulling any g's.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     This thing must have inertial dampeners.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     See any enemy troops when we came through?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     No, but that doesn't mean we weren't detected.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Is that a city?

   [The viewscreen shows a city beyond the edge of the forest.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     I'm gonna set her down in those trees.

   EXT--SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY

   [The ship has landed, and the rear ramp opens. The teams come rushing
   out, the officers and airmen with weapons at the ready, surveying the
   area.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (leaving the ship)
     Wait a minute. I thought the reason why we brought the ship was so
     that we didn't have to walk.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We can't just fly into an alien city. The mission is stealth recon,
     meaning undetected.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (shoving his way between them, whispering harshly)
     Meaning, shut up!

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Sorry.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Donner, Mansfield, guard the ship. Bosworth, you're with us. C'mon,
     move out!

   [They begin to move away.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (in aside, to Alternate Carter)
     Why'd we have to park so far away?

   [Alternate Carter laughs at his question.]

   EXT--FOREST PATH ON CHULAK, DAY

   [Alternate Kawalsky and O'Neill are walking side by side, Alternate
   Carter and Daniel behind them.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Seriously, why did we bring them?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Oh, I don't know. I guess I had a gut feeling.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Like Peru?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     All right, that didn't work out so well.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (laughing lightly)
     Sierra Leone? Uganda?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     All right, look. Maybe the better question here is why'd you invite
     me on this dog and pony?

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Well, let's just say I prefer my good instinct over yours.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [They hear birds chirping and Alternate Daniel points one out to
   Alternate Carter. There are other sounds, and Alternate O'Neill signals
   for everyone to stop. He and the other soldiers go to one knee on the
   ground. Alternate Carter and Daniel get the message and join them.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (copying Alternate O'Neill's hand signals)
     What's with the...?

   [As they try to assess the situation, there is a beeping sound and then
   a spherical object lands in front of them. A red light glows on it. It
   is a Goa'uld stun grenade, and it's clearly ticking.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (recognizing that it is a bomb of some sort)
     Ah, sh--

   [The grenade goes off in a blast of white light, leaving all five
   people unconscious. Jaffa emerge from the forest all around them,
   pointing their staff weapons at the bodies.]

   EXT--OUSIDE A LARGE FORTRESS ON CHULAK, DAY

   INT--LARGE PRISON CELL, CHULAK

   [The cell is the same one in which Teal'c turned from Apophis and
   helped the original team escape after they'd been caught and Sha're
   taken as a host. Alternate Daniel is lying on the floor and awakens,
   then sits up. The others are awakening on the steps leading to the
   gridded cell doors.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Hello? Anybody there?

   [His vision is very blurry but he makes out several people as
   indistinct shapes.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We're all here.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Where are we?

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (irritated)
     It looks like a prison cell.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Anyone seen my glasses?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I think they must have taken them.

   [Her glasses are gone as well.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Why would they do that?

   [She shrugs. There is a sound of footsteps outside. They all stand as
   the metal mesh doors open and someone strides in wearing a cloak. His
   face is revealed: it is Alternate Teal'c.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Teal'c.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (unable to see well)
     From the tape?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     If you know my name, then you know enough to fear me.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Look, I know that this might sound a little crazy, but--

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Who are you?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Hi, uh, uh...

   [He moves forward, bumps into Alternate O'Neill and grasps his
   shoulders, then moves around him to stand in front of Teal'c. Alternate
   O'Neill faintly wipes at his uniform where Alternate Daniel had touched
   him.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     Uh, we're from the Tau'ri. We call it Earth. You see, we found this
     tape, um, from the past. You see, apparently, we're
     (gesturing to the others behind him)
     a part of a team.
     (indicating Alternate O'Neill, Carter, then Teal'c)
     Um, the four of us
     (indicating Alternate Kawalsky and Bosworth)
     not the two of them. We're called SG-1. Now, we used this time
     device to go back in the past, and we screwed up the past and
     changed the future. See, you're not supposed to be still Apophis'
     First Prime. The Jaffa are supposed to be free, and
     (more quietly to Alternate Teal'c, as if in aside)
     we know that you think the Goa'uld are false gods.

   [Without hesitation, Alternate Teal'c backhands him across the face and
   he falls. Alternate Carter, Kawalsky and Bosworth run to help him.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (not very seriously)
     That wasn't necessary.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Speak of such blasphemy again, and I will kill you where you stand.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     Look, I know this is a lot to throw at you all at one time, and you
     gotta put up a little show for the boys here, but the fact is,
     (whispering)
     we know the truth.

   [Alternate Daniel hauls himself up using Alternate O'Neill's body and
   puts his arm around Alternate O'Neill's shoulder.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (squinting)
     You see, it's all on the tape. Uh, you have to see it. It's, uh,
     um...

   [Alternate O'Neill brushes Alternate Daniel's hand off his shoulder,
   but Alternate Daniel remains close and holds Alternate O'Neill by his
   nearer shoulder as he continues speaking.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     It's, it's in a... it's in the camera that, um, um, you took from
     the bag that you took from me. If you bring it to me, I can, I can
     show you how it works and we can char--

   [Alternate Teal'c grabs him by the jacket at the back of his neck and
   starts marching him up the steps and out of the cell. Alternate O'Neill
   maneuvers out of the way and does not try to stop what is happening.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (scared, after looking back at Alternate O'Neill)
     --we could, we could go, and see it, over at uh, wherever you wanna
     go.

   [The prison door slides closed and the Jaffa leave after Alternate
   Teal'c.]

   INT--APOPHIS' THRONE ROOM, CHULAK

   [Alternate Teal'c marches Alternate Daniel down a corridor and to the
   base of some steps. Alternate Daniel sees a blurry figure dressed in
   gold and sitting on the throne at the top of the steps.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (forcing him to his knees)
     Kneel before your god.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (bent forward)
     Kneeling.

   [He straightens on his knees and it is revealed that it is Alternate
   Apophis sitting on the throne.]

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS
     Who are you?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Name's Daniel Jackson. Uh, if you give me back my eyeglasses, I
     could actually see you.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     He claims he is of the Tau'ri.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (to Alternate Teal'c)
     You weren't supposed to tell him that.

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS
     The Tau'ri have no chappa'ai.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Oh! Sorry, guess I was wrong. I'm sure your information is correct
     and-- In fact, I'm usually quite wrong, quite unreliable actually.
     To be honest with you, I'm insane.

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS

     Speak!
     (reacting to Alternate Daniel's silence)
     Bring him.

   [Alternate Teal'c grabs Alternate Daniel by the neck and arm and forces
   him up the steps and onto his knees at the feet of Alternate Apophis.
   Alternate Apophis stands and looks down at him.]

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS
     I think there is much you can tell me.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Well, if you wanna know about the early settlers of Mesopotamia, I
     am somewhat of an expert--

   [Alternate Apophis raises his left hand and activates the ribbon device
   onto Alternate Daniel's forehead. Alternate Daniel makes pained sounds
   and appears confused by what is happening.]

   INT--LARGE PRISON CELL, CHULAK

   [Alternate Kawalsky and O'Neill are resting against the wide gridded
   openings of the cell doors, looking outward. Alternate Carter is behind
   them.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     It's been over an hour.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (to Alternate O'Neill)
     Maybe you shouldn't have said anything.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     All I said was, 'This is gonna sound a little crazy'.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     While there are obvious similarities, our timeline is different from
     the one in which Teal'c came to believe that the Goa'uld were false
     gods.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Are you saying this guy might not turn?

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (grimacing)
     It's possible.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     And you're telling me this now?

   INT--APOPHIS' THRONE ROOM, CHULAK

   [Alternate Apophis is still torturing Alternate Daniel with the ribbon
   device as Teal'c looks on without emotion. Alternate Apophis turns off
   the device, and Alternate Daniel crumples to the floor, still conscious
   but clenching his hands in agony.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     This one is strong.

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS
     Leave us.

   [Alternate Teal'c bows and backs away. Alternate Daniel rises on his
   arms and looks up at Alternate Apophis.]

     ALTERNATE APOPHIS
     You will tell me all that you know.

   [Alternate Apophis activates the device again and Alternate Daniel
   begins groaning. Alternate Teal'c turns to look at what is going on,
   and appears disturbed by what he sees. But he turns and leaves the
   room.]

   INT--LARGE PRISON CELL, CHULAK

   [Alternate Kawalsky and O'Neill are still leaning against the gridded
   prison door. At the sound of someone approaching, Alternate Carter and
   Bosworth get up from where they are sitting and move to the door.
   Alternate Teal'c arrives, alone.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     What's goin' on?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (holding out the video camera from Alternate Daniel's pack)
     Show me.

   [Alternate O'Neill looks surprised, and Alternate Carter steps forward
   and takes the camera. She opens the viewscreen, starts the playback,
   and turns it around to show it to Alternate Teal'c. The voices and
   images of the original team are heard and seen.]

     DANIEL
     Um, Teal'c, you should say something.

     TEAL'C
     The Jaffa are free. False god that he is, Apophis is long dead. A
     new medicine, tretonin, has liberated us from our dependence upon
     symbiotes. The Jaffa have risen up as brothers and sisters and
     defeated the Goa'uld.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (completely shocked by what he has seen)
     What trickery is this?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     It's not a trick.

     TEAL'C
     You have a son, Rya'c, who is now married and a strong leader among
     the newly formed Jaffa nation. If all these things have not come to
     pass, you must believe that the present in which you now live exists
     only because the past has been mistakenly altered. It must be
     restored.

   [Carter shuts off the tape playback and closes the camera. Alternate
   Teal'c is speechless with shock.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Please. You have to help us. The reason we came here was to get you
     so we could go back in time and fix things.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     That's not true. We just wanna get out of here. Now, if you can help
     us, we'll do our best to help you.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     I cannot free you.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     What about our weapons. Our vests. Can you get us those?

   [Alternate Teal'c looks at him, considering what he has heard.]

   INT--LARGE PRISON CELL, CHULAK

   [Some time later, the gridded doors slide open and two Jaffa drag an
   unconscious Alternate Daniel into the room. They leave him on the
   floor, not gently.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Easy, easy! Get outta here!

   [The Jaffa leave, and the doors slide closed.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     Pewter pissants... (he kneels beside Alternate Daniel and places a
     hand on his chest)
     Hey.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL

     (grunting, with his eyes just opening)
     I didn't tell them anything.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Good for you! How you feelin'?

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     Not so good, really.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Sorry. Maybe this'll make you feel better.

   [He gestures to Alternate Kawalsky and the others where they are
   standing below, and they rush to a dark, partially hidden corner of the
   cell. Alternate O'Neill pulls Alternate Daniel to his feet, and he
   grunts and rubs his back but follows. He sees the others pulling on
   their vests and readying their weapons.]

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     How'd you...?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Teal'c. He brought us the camera; I showed him the tape.

     ALTERNATE DANIEL
     I don't think he can be trusted.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     He gave us our weapons back. That's a good start.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     He's gonna meet us on the way back to the ship.

   [Alternate Kawalsky is attaching small blocks of explosives to the
   smaller rear door of the cell.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (handing Alternate Daniel a pistol)
     Safety off, point and shoot.

   [Alternate Daniel holds the weapon sloppily, nearly pointing it at
   Alternate O'Neill.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (pushing the gun down)
     Not at me.

   [Alternate Bosworth hands a pistol to Alternate Carter.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I don't really like guns.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Neither do I. How do you feel about explosives?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Those I like a little better.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (finishing setting the explosives)
     Cover.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (gesturing to them)
     Let's go.

   [They take cover behind a partial wall. Alternate O'Neill nods to
   Alternate Kawalsky, who pushes a button on the electronic remote
   control. The explosive blows.]

   EXT--FOREST ON CHULAK, DAY

   [The team is jogging along the forest path, Alternate O'Neill and
   Kawalsky in the lead.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Airmen? This is O'Neill.

     AIRMAN

     (via radio)
     We were starting to get worried.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     We're on our way. ETA, ten minutes.

   [They stop and raise their weapons as Alternate Teal'c steps into their
   path, his staff weapon raised.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     We gotta get goin' here.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     We got a whole battalion on our ass.

   [Alternate Teal'c fires past Alternate O'Neill to hit Alternate Daniel
   in the chest. He falls to the ground. The others point their weapons at
   Alternate Teal'c but he deactivates his staff and lowers it.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (angry)
     What the hell was that?

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Shoot him, Jack. Let's shoot him and get the hell out of here.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (quietly)
     Why'd you do that?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     He was a Goa'uld. Apophis implanted him with a symbiote in order to
     gain access to the knowledge in his mind.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     How do you know?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     I can sense it. Your friend did not give in to torture.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     He's lying.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Why would he lie, Kawalsky?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     If he wanted us all dead, why aren't we surrounded by Jaffa right
     now?

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     We will be in a few seconds if we don't get the hell out of here
     now. And I'm not taking him with us.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Apophis has ordered a fleet of ha'tak vessels to the Tau'ri.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     He's sending ships to Earth?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     The symbiote implanted within Daniel Jackson was a spy intended to
     accompany you. Apophis now knows what Daniel Jackson knew. He knows
     that you came in a ship. He knows that the Tau'ri is a threat.

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     How the hell do we know you're not a spy?

   [Alternate Daniel's right arm suddenly rises, holding the pistol, and
   he shoots Bosworth twice with it. Then he sits up and shoots at
   Alternate Teal'c, hitting his left arm. Alternate O'Neill and Kawalsky
   turn and shoot Alternate Daniel with their machine guns, hitting him in
   the torso many times. He falls back to the ground, his eyes open. His
   eyes glow briefly, then he closes his eyes, dead.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     His eyes glowed!

   [Alternate Kawalsky rushes back to check the pulse of Alternate Daniel
   and then Bosworth.]

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY

     (to Alternate O'Neill, shaking his head)
     He's dead.

   [A staff blast from the forest hits the tree right next to Alternate
   Kawalsky. Many more blasts start coming in.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Go! Go!

   [The three begin running with Alternate O'Neill covering them, firing.
   They all race through the forest under fire and reach the ship, which
   is also under fire from a different direction. One of the airman
   guarding the ship is hit as the other keeps firing. Alternate Carter
   and Teal'c make it onto the ship and are firing their weapons from
   within it. The other airman gets hit and Alternate O'Neill moves to
   replace him and fire in that direction. Alternate Kawalsky is firing at
   an line of advancing Jaffa.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Kawalsky!

     ALTERNATE KAWALSKY
     Go! Start it up!

   [Alternate O'Neill runs into the ship and takes the pilot seat. As
   Alternate Kawalsky turns to run inside, he is hit in the back with two
   staff blasts.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Kawalsky's been hit!

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Go!

   [Alternate O'Neill activates the ship, and the ramp begins to close as
   Alternate Teal'c continues firing through the shrinking opening.
   Alternate Kawalsky lies unmoving on the ground outside. The ship lifts
   off and speeds away, some small damage from the still-incoming staff
   blasts showing on its hull.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Carter appears shell shocked and sinks to the bench in the
   rear compartment. Alternate Teal'c looks at her curiously.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Are you injured?

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     No. I, I've just never seen anyone killed before. Daniel and
     Kawalsky... (noticing his wound)
     Oh my god, you've been shot!

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     It will heal.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     All right, we've got some problems here.

   [A blast hits the ship and sparks go off inside the cabin.]

   EXT--ABOVE SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY

   [Two death gliders are pursuing the Puddle Jumper, firing on it
   maneuvers rapidly.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Carter joins Alternate O'Neill and sits in the co-pilot
   seat. Alternate Teal'c sits behind her.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Gliders.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     I can't shake 'em, either.

   [More short circuits and small explosions occur in the cabin.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     The gate will be well guarded.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     You know something, I don't think we're gonna make it to the gate.

   [Alternate Carter looks back at the rear cabin with the time travel
   device, then looks back at Alternate O'Neill.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     There is a way out.
     (to Alternate Teal'c)
     Was there a Stargate on this planet five thousand years ago?

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     I believe so.

   [Alternate Carter looks at Alternate O'Neill, who looks doubtful. She
   nods at him in encouragement. He closes his eyes in concentration. The
   time device glows.]

   EXT--ABOVE THE SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper enters the time distortion field and emerges in the
   same place, but now at sunset. The ship is still flying above the
   forest but is not being pursued by gliders.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I think you did it.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     What has he done?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I think we just traveled back in time.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Check it out. Dial Earth.

   [Alternate Carter dials the symbols for Earth on the dialing device.
   The ship enters a wormhole.]

   EXT--EGYPT, 5000 YEARS AGO, DAY

   [The Stargate is situated near a Great Pyramid and other smaller
   structures. It is active, and the Puddle Jumper shoots out of it and
   flies away.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (looking out the viewscreen)
     Well, this is definitely ancient Egypt.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Those ha'tak vessels bore the mark of Ra.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     He ruled on Earth during this period.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     It is likely we were detected exiting the chappa'ai.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, no ships on our tail, but I think we'll skedaddle anyway.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     You're saying you're on board with trying to fix the past?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, we did kinda screw up our timeline, didn't we?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Well, the only way to stop the invasion on Earth is to make sure
     that it never happens.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah, remind me how we do that, again?

   [Alternate Carter looks at him but does not offer an answer.]

   EXT--DESERT IN EGYPT, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper is parked on the sand, surrounded by small dunes.
   Alternate O'Neill exits via the rear ramp, followed by the other two.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     All right, here's the plan. We make contact with the locals...

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     And then?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     That's all I got so far.

   [He walks off, and the others follow.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Uh, any idea what time it is, exactly?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (looking at his watch)
     Three o'clock.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Uh, sorry, I-I kinda meant what year.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, you and Daniel said there was some kind of a failed rebellion.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     In 2995 B.C.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (looking at her in shock)
     B.C.?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Colonel.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Kidding. And call me Jack, will ya?

   [She nods as they continue walking.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN VILLAGE, 2995 B.C., DAY

   [This appears to be the same village that the original SG-1 visited
   looking for the ZPM. As the three enter, a young boy runs to his
   father, screaming words of fear. The father takes the boy in his arms
   and moves away.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Hey! It's all right, folks, we come in peace, nothin' to be afraid
     of.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I doubt they speak English.

   [Katep, the surviving brother whom the original SG-1 met, approaches
   them.]

     KATEP
     Hello.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     He does.

     KATEP
     Yes. I am Katep.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     I am Jack.

     KATEP

     (looking at them each in turn)
     O'Neill. Colonel Carter, and Teal'c.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     How'd you know--

     KATEP

     Please come with me. Ra's patrols come through here often. They must
     not see you (to Alternate Teal'c)
     Especially you. Please, come.

   [He jogs away and they follow.]

   INT--TENT IN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE

   [Katep leads them into a large tent made of pieces of fabric.]

     KATEP

     (gesturing for them to enter)
     Please.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     How do you know who we are?

     KATEP
     This is not the first time we have met.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     You knew the other SG-1 team.

     KATEP
     Five years ago. You came, you were witness to the death of my
     brother at the hands of Ra. After you were trapped here, we planned
     an uprising together.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     So much for causality.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Ra is still here. We have seen his ship.

     KATEP
     Our first attempt at gathering forces for the rebellion did not go
     well. We had to expose ourselves to those who proved still loyal to
     Ra. You were captured and executed long before the plan could be
     finished.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Really? All of us?

     KATEP
     All but one.

   [A man walks into the tent, his head bowed and covered. He stands up
   straight as he pushes back the covering. It is Daniel. He looks at each
   of them in turn. Alternate Carter smiles at him.]

     DANIEL
     Well, this can't be a good sign.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Why's that?

     DANIEL
     Where am I?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Ancient Egypt?

     DANIEL
     No, I mean the me from your timeline.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     I killed you.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     TEAL'C
     You were a Goa'uld spy.

     DANIEL

     (matter of factly)
     A good reason.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     It was horrible.

     DANIEL

     (uninterested)
     Yeah, I'm sure.
     (emphatic)
     Why are you here?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yes. Excellent question.

     DANIEL
     You don't know.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, I thought I did, there, for a while, and then I realized I...
     didn't.

     DANIEL
     Well, I know why I'm here.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Good! Let's start there.

     DANIEL
     We came back in time to get a ZPM.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Right! It was buried with the tape. Why is it so important? I think
     you were about to explain it but the, uh, the batteries on the
     camera ran out.

     DANIEL
     Long story. Why don't you take a seat?

   [Alternate Cater and O'Neill sit on a bench while Alternate Teal'c
   remains standing.]

     DANIEL

     Basically we got trapped here because
     (indicating Alternate Carter)
     you didn't want to affect the timeline, but ultimately
     (indicating Alternate O'Neill and Teal'c)
     you and you couldn't stand the idea of living out the rest of your
     lives under Ra's rule without doing anything. We remembered there
     was a rebellion here on Earth. That's how the gate got buried in the
     first place. So, we figured what difference does it make if we're
     involved or not? Unfortunately, we never got a chance to execute the
     plan.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     We heard.

     DANIEL
     Yes. We tried to do too much too fast. Since then, Katep and I have
     been slowly building up an underground movement. I can only assume
     things don't go well because if you're here, you saw the tape, and
     the future still needs fixing.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Somethin' like that.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Oh, we didn't just see the tape. We saw the tablet.

     DANIEL
     What tablet?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Oh. The one you haven't written yet. And put where the Stargate was
     supposed to be buried.

     DANIEL
     Supposed to be.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     In our timeline, the rebellion that you planned actually works. Ra
     ends up leaving, and Earth is freed, but, uh, Ra takes the Stargate
     with him.

     DANIEL
     Okay, that's a problem.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Yes! The gate is never found at Giza, and none of us join the
     Stargate program. But you left a tablet in an obscure Egyptian
     dialect telling us the date of the rebellion and where to find the
     second Stargate in Antarctica.

     DANIEL
     Good for me. So you're here to make sure Ra doesn't take this
     Stargate.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     It's a plan.

   [A young boy rushes in. Daniel bends down and holds him by the
   shoulders.]

     BOY
     Daneel! Daneel! Jaffa!

     KATEP
     We must hide.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Where?

     KATEP
     In here.

   [Katep and the young boy peel back a rug and start digging sand out of
   the way. They uncover a square slab and pull it away, revealing a
   vertical shaft with a wooden ladder against one side.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN VILLAGE, 2995 B.C., DAY

   [The populace is running chaotically out of the path the Jaffa, who
   arrive in force from one side of the village. The stride in, treating
   the villagers roughly. One stands watching, his face covered by a Jaffa
   helmet.]

   INT--CHAMBER BENEATH THE TENT

   [Daniel is the last of the team to descend the ladder, and he uses a
   torch to illuminate the large store of weapons at one end of the
   chamber. There are many staff weapons arrayed against the wall, zats
   piled in a box, and the original SG-1's packs.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Sweet.

   INT--TENT IN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE

   [A Jaffa enters the tent. Katep and the young boy are there.]

     JAFFA

     (to someone outside the tent)
     Kree! Lok'nel!

   [Other Jaffa enter the tent. Katep and the boy move to stand on top of
   the rug on the stone that covers the chamber.]

   INT--CHAMBER BENEATH THE TENT

     DANIEL
     We've got secret stores of weapons like this in several positions
     throughout the region.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     How many troops?

     DANIEL
     Uh, a couple of thousand, but that's not really the issue. According
     to you, my own account of history says we win the revolt.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We just need to make sure that the gate stays here and gets buried.

     DANIEL
     Which means we have to steal it and hide it from Ra.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     But it's out in the open, close to his ship.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Holding such a position against a ha'tak would be virtually
     impossible, even for a short period of time.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Also, the gate is kinda heavy.

     DANIEL
     Well, we also have a ship.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (gesturing with his hands)
     Yes, but you see, the ship fits in the gate, not the other way
     around.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     There has to be a way that we can cable the gate to the ship; fly it
     out.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah, but we still gotta get close to it without being detected.

     DANIEL
     Well, that's easy. The ship has a cloaking device.

   [The others look at him in shock.]

     DANIEL
     Makes it invisible.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (incredulous)
     You're telling me this now?

     DANIEL
     I was sure I mentioned it on the tape.

   [Alternate O'Neill looks at Alternate Carter, and she shakes her head
   'no'.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     If we were able to time our approach to coordinate with the
     uprising, we may yet have a chance.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We'll need to test the cloak. We took an awful lot of damage coming
     out of Chulak.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (irritated, to Daniel)
     Because we didn't know about the damned cloak!

     DANIEL
     I was sure I mentioned it on the tape!

   [Dust begins to fall on them as the stone is slid away from the opening
   above them. Katep looks down on them.]

     KATEP
     They are gone!

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT, 2995 B.C., DAY

   [Alternate O'Neill and Carter are walking alone, still dressed in their
   camouflage BDU's.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     You ever wonder what your life's gonna be like in the future?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Won't really be my life, will it.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     No, but still. I mean, I've led such a small and unimportant
     existence, I can't ever imagine being a hero who saves the planet.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Well, we do have a time machine. We could go check it out.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     No way. We've already screwed up enough. Once we're done with the
     gate, we need to destroy the ship.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Seriously?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Absolutely.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (realization hitting)
     You mean we have to stay here?

   [Alternate Carter nods.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I wonder if the future me has a boyfriend.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill and Carter enter and move to the front. Alternate
   O'Neill sits in the pilot's seat. He has to tap the console several
   times to get the ship to respond and power up.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     So what do I do?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Um, try thinking 'invisible'.

   [He shrugs and puts his hands on the controls.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     Okay.
     (he closes his eyes and waits a moment)
     How do we know if it's working?

   [Alternate Carter jogs outside to look. The ship is not cloaked.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (calling inside)
     Nope!

   INT--TENT IN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE

   [Daniel, Alternate Teal'c, and Katep are seated around a table with a
   stack of maps and battle plans written on parchment.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (a bit surprised)
     Your strategy is good. But it does not work well as a distraction in
     our plan to steal the chappa'ai.

     DANIEL
     Wait, we know this plan works. If we alter it...

     KATEP
     We may fail.

     DANIEL
     With this plan, the uprising succeeds, and Ra leaves.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     And Ra takes the chappa'ai. If we are to be successful in keeping Ra
     from taking the chappa'ai, we must focus the efforts of the
     rebellion on distracting him from it.
     (seeing Daniel's uncertain look)
     Trust me.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Carter is looking at a compartment of clear, glass-like
   components. She takes one out and begins testing it using a lighted
   cable hanging from the ceiling. Alternate O'Neill looks on from the
   front of the ship.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     How's it goin'?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I've never seen this kind of technology before.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (gently challenging)
     Hey, you're supposed to be a genius. That's why I brought you along.

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     I'm working on it. I think the power relay was overloaded. I may be
     able to reroute the circuit to the control interface... (noting that
     he is staring at her)
     What?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     It's just a little weird hearin' that kind of stuff come out of
     someone so...

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (turning to him, defensively)
     So what?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Hot.

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (after a cough, disbelieving)
     Really?

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Wow. Um, it's just you... you're not the kind of guy that I usually
     attract.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     No?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     No. God. Wow! This is kinda awkward.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Yeah, it's gettin' there.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I'm kind of attracted to... Daniel.

   [He stares at her with a confused look.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (shocked)
     What?

   [He steps closer to her.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (amazed)
     Really?

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Sorry.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     No, that's okay, no problem there. It's just, you know... First
     impressions, I kinda thought he was...

   [He rotates his hand up and down. She shakes her head and looks at him,
   completely confused.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Never mind.

   [She nods. He puffs out a breath and turns back to the piloting
   compartment. She goes back to examining the component, grimacing.]

   EXT--DESERT OF EGYPT, 2995 B.C., DAY

   [Alternate O'Neill is lying on a sand dune very near the ship. Through
   his binoculars, he sees a patrol of Jaffa approaching. He activates his
   small radio.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Carter. How's it goin' in there?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Carter is still examining the glass component. She answers
   the radio.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Uh, I think I'm almost there.

   EXT--DESERT OF EGYPT, 2995 B.C., DAY

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     That's good. We're about to have some company.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [He jogs back to the ship and enters via the rear ramp, closing it
   behind him.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     We have a patrol on its way here.

   [She stops what she's doing as he takes the pilot seat.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Try it.

   [He activates the ship via the controls and looks around.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Nothin's happening.

   [Alternate Carter returns to working on the panel above her head.]

   INT--TENT IN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE

   [Alternate Teal'c, Daniel, and Katep are still looking at the battle
   plans. They hear Alternate O'Neill's voice over the radio.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Hey, guys, we got a little problem here.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate Carter is still working on the panel above her head.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Carter, forget it. I'm just gonna take off.

   [She stops working.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The Jaffa patrol is marching in a narrow line between sand dunes. They
   are very close to the ship but haven't seen it yet.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill is looking around the pilot seat.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (slapping the panel he had hit before)
     God! Now that's not workin'.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Oh boy!

   [She goes back to working on the panel components.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The patrol continues to advance.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Try the cloak now.

   [Alternate O'Neill closes his eyes.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The ship becomes cloaked just as the Jaffa patrol reaches the edge of
   the sand dune where they would have seen it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (coming to stand beside Alternate O'Neill)
     Did it work?

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The Jaffa patrol approaches the ship's location. They do not react to
   it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (gesturing to the view screen)
     Apparently.

   [Some of the lights go off and there is a sound of something powering
   down.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The ship un-cloaks. The Jaffa see it and immediately advances on it,
   surrounding it, their staff weapons pointed at it. From inside,
   Alternate Carter and O'Neill can see the Jaffa, who can in turn see
   them through the viewscreen.]

     JAFFA

     (to Alternate O'Neill)
     Shak'na kree!

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     What?

   [The Jaffa shoots at the viewscreen with his staff weapon. Other Jaffa
   begin firing.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [There are sparks flying inside the ship.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (getting up and pushing Alternate Carter toward the rear)
     Go, go, go, go!

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The Jaffa are firing at the ship from all directions.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill closes the door between the command area and the
   time machine/aft compartment. He kneels down with Alternate Carter
   behind the time machine as the shooting continues.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Get down! Whoa.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     This could be a problem.

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Ya think?!

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     If they penetrate the hull and hit the engines, the energy blasts
     could feed back into the power--

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Carter!

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     We could explode!

   [He looks her for a moment, concerned, as the weapons continue to fire,
   then activates his radio.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Daniel, Teal'c.

     DANIEL

     (over radio)
     We're almost there!

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [Daniel and Alternate Teal'c approach the ship and hear the weapons
   firing. They crouch behind a sand dune and can see the ship under
   relentless fire.]

     DANIEL
     Well, this doesn't look good.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     DANIEL
     Though it is quite ironic. This whole thing started because Sam
     didn't want to take the Jumper back from a Jaffa patrol.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The damage continues inside the ship, with various sparks and small
   explosions.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     Look, if we don't make it?

   [She takes his head in both hands and kisses him. After she stops, he
   looks surprised and then very irritated.]

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL
     Wait a minute. You said you liked Daniel.

     ALTERNATE CARTER
     I lied. I just wanted to get to know you better. You see, usually
     I'm a very cautious person and I tend to think things--

   [He looks around briefly and then grabs her head and kisses her as
   sparks fly all around the cabin. She grabs him back and they continue
   kissing.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [The Jaffa are still firing at the ship.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Jaffa!

   [He and Daniel are walking up to the Jaffa, their weapons lowered. The
   Jaffa take note of them and stop firing at the ship.]

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (dropping his staff weapon to the sand)
     Hear me! Ra is not a god! You can live free!

   [The Jaffa leader points his staff weapon at them.]

     JAFFA
     A'kek, shol'va!

     DANIEL
     I don't think he bought it.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill and Carter are kissing but then realize the firing
   has stopped. They open their eyes and stop.]

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C
     Relinquish your weapons and surrender!

     JAFFA
     Kel'tek trey! Lo ta'nak!

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

     ALTERNATE TEAL'C

     (shouting)
     Shal'tek!

   [Katep emerges from behind a sand dune, holding an automatic rifle and
   wearing one of the SG-1 vests. He gestures and yells, and many other
   Egyptian villagers rise from behind the dunes, armed with staff weapons
   and zats. The Jaffa look to see most of the ridges around them lined
   with armed villagers, yelling very loudly together, their arms raised.
   The Jaffa leader moves his staff weapon around to point it at Daniel,
   who raises his rifle in return. Realizing his position is hopeless, the
   Jaffa leader drops his staff weapon, and the other Jaffa follow suit.
   The villagers cheer very loudly. Daniel activates his radio.]

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Sam, Jack. It's all clear. You can come out now.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ALTERNATE O'NEILL

     (into radio, casually)
     In a minute.

   EXT--EGYPTIAN DESERT OUTSIDE THE SHIP, DAY

   [Daniel and Alternate Teal'c exchanged puzzled looks.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Alternate O'Neill and Carter begin kissing again. They tip over
   sideways and fall to the floor together. The time machine sparks once,
   then stops.]

     ALTERNATE CARTER

     (from the floor, not visible)
     I can fix that.

   INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [The original SG-1's video from their trip into the past is playing on
   a computer monitor.]

     DANIEL

     (on video)
     Uh, Jack, you should say something.

     O'NEILL

     (on video)
     Uh, college football is played on Saturdays, pro on Sundays, and
     there are no fish in my pond, at all, where I fish.
     (looking back at Carter and Daniel)
     I think that covers it for me.

   [O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are in Daniel's office watching
   the video. Daniel stops the playback. There is a live ZPM sitting in a
   box on the table.]

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Is that correct?

     O'NEILL
     If it is, we don't do anything?

     CARTER
     Apparently nothing we did affected the timeline.

     O'NEILL
     But we didn't do anything.

     CARTER
     Not yet. Apparently we were going to, two weeks from now, but now we
     don't have to.

     O'NEILL
     Excellent! That's it! I like it!

   [Daniel and Teal'c smile and walk away. Carter reaches to lift the ZPM
   in its box.]

     CARTER
     Okay, I'm gonna get this up to the lab for analysis.

     O'NEILL

     (grabbing the box to stop her)
     No! I'll take it. There's a whole room full of geeks up there just
     dyin' to get their hands on this. You've got packin' to do.

   [He picks up the box and walks away with it. Carter appears slightly
   miffed but smiles mildly after he leaves.]

   EXT--O'NEILL'S MINNESOTA CABIN, NEXT TO A POND

   [A fishing line falls into the water, the float bouncing on the
   surface. It is pulled back to shore to reveal Carter and O'Neill
   sitting in chairs on the dock, the cabin behind them. O'Neill is
   reeling in the line as Carter sits with her own line.]

     CARTER
     This is great.

     O'NEILL
     I told ya!

     CARTER
     I can't believe we didn't do it years ago.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, well, let's not dwell.

   [She chuckles. A fish jumps out of the water as Teal'c and Daniel walk
   up behind them, carrying a cooler between them and a folding chair in
   their other hands.]

     CARTER
     Didn't that tape say there were no fish in your pond?

   [Carter and O'Neill look at each other.]

     O'NEILL
     Close enough.

   [Carter nods. O'Neill glances back at Daniel and Teal'c. Daniel pulls a
   drink from the cooler and walks onto the dock as O'Neill casts his line
   again. He stands behind O'Neill and Carter as Teal'c sits in his chair
   on the grass.]

   FADE OUT
