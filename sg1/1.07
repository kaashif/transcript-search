   TEASER

   EXT--PLANET--DAY

   [Teal'c walks into view against a bright blue sky, wearing sunglasses.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill.

   [O'Neill walks up behind Teal'c, also wearing sunglasses.]

     O'NEILL
     What've we got here, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I do not know.

   [Teal'c and O'Neill stand overlooking a pit. The ground around them is
   bright yellow sand. In the center of the pit are crystal growths, the
   same bright shade of blue as the sky. Daniel and Carter join Teal'c and
   O'Neill. They are also wearing sunglasses; apparently the combination
   of sun and yellow sand is quite blinding. All three humans are also
   wearing gloves; O'Neill's are fingerless.]

     CARTER
     Wow.

     DANIEL
     It may indicate a...uh, civilization of some kind...

     O'NEILL
     Well, let's spread out and take a look.

     CARTER
     I think there's a way down over here...

   [The team descends toward the FRED and the crystals at the bottom of
   the pit.]

   EXT--CRYSTAL PIT --DAY

   [While Daniel films the landscape and the crystals, Carter kneels
   beside one of the bigger clusters to examine it.]

     CARTER
     Crystals...Granite...not volcanic. I don't see any that aren't
     broken.

   [Daniel squats beside another cluster and picks up two shards. They
   almost seem to be glowing.]

     DANIEL
     These pieces might fit together.

   [Daniel spots something. He puts down the two pieces of crystals he's
   holding and moves to another cluster.]

     DANIEL
     Here's a whole one.

   [Carter joins Daniel beside a crystal that seems to be more complete
   than the others. Daniel brushes the yellow sand off it. The exposed
   crystal is about twelve inches long, and three or four inches in
   diameter. It's multifaceted.]

     CARTER
     Looks like they've been blasted apart by something.

     DANIEL
     It's damaged.

   [Close up, small flecks of blue crystal are visible in the yellow sand.
   So is a large crack in the seemingly complete crystal.]

     CARTER
     Hmm...I don't see any other whole ones, do you?

   [While Daniel continues to clear sand from the largest crystal, Carter
   gets up to examine other clusters. Teal'c is watching Carter and Daniel
   from an area near the FRED.]

     O'NEILL
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c looks down at O'Neill, who is several feet below him, on the
   side of an even deeper pit. O'Neill gestures to Teal'c to let him know
   he is going to look below. O'Neill walks away from his team, toward
   another area where slightly larger crystals are clustered. They too,
   are broken, but the pieces remaining seem to be larger than the
   crystals Daniel and Carter found. In the middle of the broken crystals,
   one large, complete one stands alone...it seems to be almost three feet
   tall, and about eight inches in diameter. It is surrounded by shards of
   smaller crystals. O'Neill cautiously approaches it.]

   [Though a blue-tinted perspective, O'Neill looks down at something.
   It's as though someone is looking from within the large crystal.
   O'Neill squats down beside the crystal and takes off his sunglasses to
   examine it. He reaches out... From within the blue-tinted vision,
   O'Neill's hand comes closer and closer... Suddenly, O'Neill cries out
   as he is sent flying backward. He loses his weapon and hits the ground.
   He falls, unconscious, on the yellow sand.]

   EXT--CRYSTAL PLANET--DAY

   [On the rise between the two pits, Teal'c stands guard between the
   divided SG-1. Carter and Daniel climb to meet him.]

   EXT--CRYSTAL PLANET--DAY

   [As O'Neill lies unconscious on the yellow sand, someone stands over
   him. It's a second O'Neill. He looks both puzzled and concerned as he
   gazes down at the unconscious form beneath him. The alien O'Neill picks
   up O'Neill's hat, looks at it, and looks down at O'Neill again.]

   EXT--CRYSTAL PLANET--DAY

     DANIEL

     (to Teal'c)
     Where's the colonel?

   [Teal'c points to where O'Neill disappeared.]

     DANIEL

     (over radio)
     Jack, we've finished our recon, loaded up FRED, and we're ready to
     head back to the Gate. Is this...am I using this right?

   [Over by the unconscious O'Neill, the alien O'Neill ignores Daniel's
   transmission as he picks up O'Neill's weapon.]

     CARTER

     (yelling)
     We're ready to head out, sir!

   [The alien O'Neill looks to where the shouts are coming from. He looks
   back down at O'Neill, still lying unconscious on the ground.]

     DANIEL

     (yelling)
     Colonel!

   [The alien O'Neill seems to come to a decision. He heads toward the
   team, leaving O'Neill lying on the ground.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM--DAY

   [Daniel, Teal'c and Carter walk through the Gate back into the SGC,
   followed by the alien O'Neill, who pauses at the top of the ramp,
   looking at everything with amazement. At the bottom of the ramp, an
   airman with some kind of radiation monitor waves a wand over him.]

     AIRMAN
     Radiation level check...all clear.

   [O'Neill looks up. Watching their arrival, Hammond stands with the
   technicians in the Control Room.]

     HAMMOND

     (over the intercom)
     Welcome back, SG-1. Debriefing will commence at oh-nine-hundred.

   [As Carter, Teal'c and Daniel leave the Gate Room, the alien O'Neill
   takes off his sunglasses and gazes around at his new
   surroundings.</blockquote>

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM--DAY

   [Teal'c, Carter, Hammond, and Daniel are seated around the table.
   Carter is talking. Teal'c is looking at some notes. Daniel seems to be
   looking at a book. An airman is standing guard by the door.]

     CARTER
     The samples we brought back are being analyzed, and we explored a
     ten kilometer radius around the Gate without finding any sign of
     recent Goa'uld mining activity. In fact, there's no indication that
     Goa'ulds or anyone else have been through that Gate in a thousand
     years.

   [Alien O'Neill is standing with his back to the room, looking through
   the observation window at the Gate Room below.]

     HAMMOND
     Tell me about these crystals.

     DANIEL
     Uhm, we found thousands in a pit near the Stargate. Since we didn't
     find them anywhere else on the planet, it's likely that they were
     gathered and put there.

   [The alien O'Neill flashes back to the moment the real O'Neill stood
   over the crystal.]

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     DANIEL
     Early Greek cultures valued crystals and gemstones; perhaps the pit
     has some religious...or ceremonial...significance.

   [Alien O'Neill flashes back to O'Neill reaching out to touch the
   crystal, then his subsequent shock and unconscious landing.]

     HAMMOND
     Your report doesn't mention any local population.

     DANIEL
     There's no evidence of a developed culture; no roads, villages,
     settlements, nothing...

   [The alien O'Neill rejoins the group at the table.]

     CARTER

     I'm with Daniel... (indicates a photo of the damaged crystal she and
     Daniel found, displayed on a computer monitor)
     We didn't find any unbroken crystals but we have this one and pieces
     of a few larger ones back in decon right now.

     HAMMOND
     Flag this one, Colonel. SG-1 is on stand down until your next
     mission comes up. Dismissed.

   [Hammond leaves the room. SG-1 pack up their things.]

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM--DAY

   [Alien O'Neill runs his fingers over the nametag on O'Neill's locker.
   He opens the door and takes out a leather jacket, pulling it on over
   his civilian clothing. Looking down, the alien O'Neill notices a Van
   Dyck cigar box on the bottom of the locker. He pulls it out and sits on
   the bench to open it. Inside are a wedding ring, a leather key case,
   and a pile of photographs. There's one of O'Neill as a young soldier,
   several of a small child, and finally, one of O'Neill and Charlie with
   a trophy.]

   [The alien O'Neill remembers throwing a ball in the air and catching
   it-- Charlie hitting the ball with a bat--Charlie jumping with
   excitement. Obviously, this alien has some of the real O'Neill's
   memories.]

   [The alien O'Neill pauses at a photo of the real O'Neill, Sara and
   Charlie standing in front of a large blue house, just as Carter enters
   the locker room.]

     CARTER
     Hey, Colonel.

   [The alien O'Neill looks up at Carter, then looks down at the letters
   he's just reached at the bottom of the box. The top one is addressed to
   HQ US Airforce, Att Col. Jack O'Neill, 890 AF Pentagon. The return
   address is Sara O'Neill, 842 Cranbroke Lane, Winter Park, CO 80310.]

     CARTER

     Uh, listen, no offense, Colonel, but this becomes the women's locker
     room in...
     (she looks at her watch)
     uh, now. You know how I hate those sandy planets.

   [Carter smiles and looks over at the alien O'Neill, who doesn't appear
   to have heard her. She looks impatient.]

     CARTER
     You don't have to hurry on my account.

   [Carter notices what he's holding and walks a little closer, sort of
   peering over his shoulder.]

     CARTER
     Nice...You have a family.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes.

     CARTER

     (nods)
     I'm an auntie, myself. My brother moved to San Diego, so I don't get
     to see them much...He has two kids now, boy and a girl. I miss 'em
     like hell; don't get there near enough.

   [The Alien O'Neill rises, puts the box back in the locker and closes
   the door, paying no attention to her. Carter looks at him, smiling and
   nodding.]

     CARTER
     I can see you feel the same way.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Goodbye, Sam.

     CARTER
     Bye.

   [The alien O'Neill exits the Locker Room, almost running into Daniel on
   his way in. Daniel does a little dance step to avoid him. Carter looks
   at Daniel with surprise as he enters the locker room.]

     DANIEL
     Jack seems very...focused.

     CARTER
     Yeah. He was looking at pictures of his family. He must be in a
     hurry to get home. I didn't even know he was married.

     DANIEL

     Oh, he isn't. (off Carter's astonished look)
     Um...he was but they separated after his son...died.

   [Carter blinks, speechless, and Daniel exits the locker room.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [The alien O'Neill walks down a busy corridor. He turns to look at
   Teal'c, who intercepts him at a crossover.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill. You are departing?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes.

     TEAL'C
     You said one day you would show me your world. I would like to see
     it now.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Another time.

   [The alien O'Neill walks away. Teal'c looks after him, blinking in
   apparent puzzlement.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR--DAY

   [Carter and Daniel are walking, deep in conversation.]

     CARTER
     I've known the man for months and he doesn't say word one about a
     life outside this place and I'm thinking he just doesn't have one.
     What else don't I know about him?

     DANIEL
     Well, he doesn't really tell you much until he gets to know you.

     CARTER
     Yeah, that's an understatement.

   [Daniel and Carter arrive at the lab. They enter and approach a young
   female scientist, who is working with the damaged crystal they found.]

     CARTER
     All right, what do we have here?

     SCIENTIST
     Passed all the decontamination protocols; but I noticed it's got a
     low-level E.M. field you should check out. Either that or my fridge
     magnets fell of the wall by themselves.

   [Carter and the scientist chuckle.]

     DANIEL

     (to the scientist)
     I'm sorry...EM?

     CARTER

     Electromagnetic energy. (to scientist)
     Thanks.

   [The scientist nods and walks away. Carter wheels the table with the
   crystal closer to a counter where several smaller crystals have been
   placed. She slips on gloves.]

     CARTER
     So um...tell me more about the Colonel. What happened to his son?

   [Daniel looks at Carter, looks away, and frowns.]

     DANIEL
     Charlie...accidentally killed himself with Jack's personal gun.

     CARTER
     Oh, God. That's horrible.

     DANIEL
     Jack never forgave himself. He holed up and turned his back on the
     world for uh...a long time.

     CARTER

     I can imagine. I don't know what I'd do.
     (turns to examine the crystal through a magnifying glass)
     What about his wife?

     DANIEL
     Sara? I don't think they've seen each other since he joined SG-1. He
     hasn't said anything about a visit but like I said...

     Carter

     (nodding)
     He doesn't tell you much.

     DANIEL
     Right.

     CARTER
     Right. Look at this...

   [She runs her fingers over the edge of the large crystal. Daniel bends
   down to look.]

     CARTER
     See the edge of this crystal here? How it's glassy, like its been
     melted?

     DANIEL
     Can you tell what did it? For me, it might shed a little light on
     what the significance of the pit was and who...put them there.

     CARTER
     It would take extreme temperatures to melt quartz crystal.

     DANIEL
     Lightning?

     CARTER

     Maybe...but it's too precise, too clean. (Carter looks up suddenly)
     I think I've seen a cut like this before. Here, in this facility.

   EXT--SARA O'NEILL'S HOME--DAY

   [The alien O'Neill is looking at the photo of O'Neill, Sara, and
   Charlie, comparing it to the house he is standing in front of. The
   front door opens, and Sara walks out.]

     SARA
     Dad, I left some iced tea in there for you.

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     (trying out different intonations)
     Hello, Sara. Hello, Sara.

   EXT--SARAH O'NEILL'S HOME--DAY

   [Sara has her sleeves rolled up, working on the engine of an old
   Mustang.]

     SARA
     It may be time to face facts, Dad. This old thing has seen better
     days.

   [Sara's father, Mike, carries a pallet of plants into view.]

     MIKE
     A girl shouldn't be so quick to give up on the aged...makes a father
     worry.

   [Mike enters the house. Sara doesn't notice, she keeps talking.]

     SARA
     Come on, Dad, I'm serious. If I keep...

   [Sara stops midsentence as she walks around the far side of the car and
   sees the alien O'Neill standing awkwardly in the driveway.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Hello, Sara.

     SARA
     Been there long?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes.

     SARA
     Could've said something.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I did.

     SARA

     (sighs)
     Right...you did.

   [Sara returns to the car. The alien O'Neill walks awkwardly to join
   her. He stares into her face, then looks down at the engine.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Something wrong?

     SARA
     I think it's the ignition...But you didn't come about the car.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     No.

     SARA
     So,...what? You decided you'd just...show up? Waltz back into my
     life? Is that it?

   [The alien O'Neill looks around. Through a blue haze, he notices
   Charlie's bike and basketball hoop.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes.

   [Sara releases a burst of air and shakes her head. She sighs.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I need to find Charlie. Is he here?

   [Sara looks at the alien O'Neill, shocked.]

     SARA
     Charlie?

   [Sara sounds shaken. She takes a step toward the alien O'Neill,
   frowning with worry as she searches his face. The alien O'Neill grasps
   Sara by the arms. His gaze becomes intent.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I need Charlie. That's his bicycle, isn't it?

     SARA
     I kept some of his things.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes. I know.

     SARA

     (slowly)
     Jack, what are you doing? You're scaring me.

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     It's important, Sara.
     (without breaking their gaze, he shouts out)
     Charlie?

     SARA
     Don't! Let go of me.

   [Sara shakes him off. She slowly backs away from the alien O'Neill.]

     SARA
     What the hell is wrong with you? Is this your idea of a joke? Just
     get away from me.

   [Sara turns and runs into the house.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     Sara! (to himself)
     I don't understand.

   [The alien O'Neill stares at the bicycle again. He is startled by Mike
   coming out of the house behind him.]

     MIKE
     Son, if upsetting her is your way of trying to win a woman's heart,
     it's a stupid one. Anyone ever tell you that?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I think you just did.

     MIKE

     (shakes his head)
     Come on in here.

   [The alien O'Neill follows him inside.]

   INT--SGC--TEAL'S QUARTERS--DAY

   [The room is very bare and utilitarian. An exposed lightbulb in a wire
   cage illuminates the room. A bed stands against one wall; a TV set is
   on a cart in the corner of the room. A desk on the side contains a few
   books and a desk lamp. Teal'c enters.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (over loudspeaker)
     Attention! All new personnel, report to the Auditorium, sublevel
     one, for orientation at fourteen-thirty hours.

   [Teal'c stares at the blank television in what seems to be surprise,
   then picks up the remote and turns it on. The first program is a news
   report. On the screen, people run around in confusion.]

     FIRST NEWS ANNOUNCER
     ...after last night's rally turned ugly. Protestors clashed with
     police, and police have announced that a dusk to dawn curfew is now
     in effect. No word yet on any casualties.

   [Teal'c stares at the television. A second announcer takes over.]

     SECOND NEWS ANNOUNCER
     In financial news, the bull was annihilated today with bears leaving
     a sea of red behind them...

   [Teal'c changes the channel, finding a music video. A figure outlined
   in fire throws an object at the camera. Teal'c frowns as he touches his
   ear. He changes the channel to another news station.]

     THIRD NEWS ANNOUNCER
     ...for the third straight day. And no one on either side could say
     how it started in the first place.

   [Carter and Daniel rush in, slightly out of breath. Teal'c turns off
   the television set.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c! We need your help.

     TEAL'C
     Your world is a strange place.

   [Carter nods.]

     DANIEL

     (stops, gives Teal'c an odd, puzzled look)
     So is yours.

     CARTER
     Listen, uh...We need to stop by the armory and sign out your staff
     weapon.

     TEAL'C
     Are we being deployed?

     CARTER
     No! No, it's okay. Come on.

   [Teal'c puts down the remote and follows Daniel and Carter.]

   INT--SARA O'NEILL'S HOME--DAY

   [The alien O'Neill and Mike are in Charlie's old room. The alien
   O'Neill is touching various toys, looking around at awards, artwork,
   photographs...the remnants of Charlie.]

     MIKE
     Parents shouldn't outlive their children. It isn't natural.

   [Mike studies the alien O'Neill, who turns away. He remembers Charlie
   running toward him, laughing.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     He loved to laugh.

     MIKE

     (chuckles)
     Yeah. Sometimes I can still hear him laughing at one of my bad
     jokes. Sara kept all his things...like that bike outside. I guess
     it's her way of keeping him around awhile.

   [The alien O'Neill has a memory of Charlie smiling and giving a
   'thumbs-up' signal.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I thought I would find Charlie here.

     MIKE
     Look around, you still might.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     He's gone. What do I do?

   [Mike looks at the alien O'Neill with concern.]

     MIKE
     Sara comes up here and talks to him sometimes and it helps her. If
     it helps you, I'm...I'm glad you're here.

   [Mike steps out of the doorway and into the room as the alien O'Neill
   moves around, touching a model rocket.]

     MIKE

     You know, Jack, for an Irishman you never were much of a talker
     but...that never mattered. I'll give you that much...you married my
     daughter. (Mike frowns, watching the alien touch Charlie's things)
     Say what you need to Charlie if that's all you come here for, but
     Sara is not over you yet, so...You break her heart again and, God
     help you, I'll make you wish you never did.

   [Mike leaves the alien O'Neill alone in Charlie's room. The alien
   O'NEill picks up a baseball and remembers pitching the ball to Charlie,
   who swings at it and hits it, cheering as the ball goes flying.]

   [The alien O'Neill puts the ball back, and picks up a picture of
   Charlie. He remembers O'Neill running to Sara, who is sitting on a
   picnic table behind the house. O'Neill wraps her in a hug and kisses
   her. Both are laughing.]

     O'NEILL
     How was your day?

     SARA
     Fine...Oh, look what came home from school today.

   [Sara reaches down and pulls out Charlie's school pictures--the same
   picture that triggered the flashback.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah...Is Charlie about ready?

     SARA
     Yeah, he was running around here a few minutes ago...

   [Sara looks around the yard. Suddenly, there is an explosive sound. A
   gunshot. O'Neill and Sara look up at the bedroom window, fear in their
   faces. O'Neill stands, then runs for the house.]

     SARA

     (screams)
     Charlie!

   [The memory ends.]

   [The alien O'Neill is huddled on Charlie's bed, rocking with a pillow
   wrapped in his arms. Sara walks by the open door, and stops when she
   sees him. She looks in with concern, then quietly walks away.]

   INT--SGC--GATE ROOM --DAY

   [Teal'c aims and fires his staff weapon at a cluster of the strange
   blue crystals in a box. The crystals shatter. As alarms go off, Carter
   and Daniel approach the pieces of blasted crystal. Teal'c follows.]

     CARTER
     Here's a good one.

   [Daniel picks up a chunk of fused crystal with large tongs.]

     TECHNICIAN

     (over loudspeaker)
     What's going on in there?

     TEAL'C
     You received permission for me to fire my staff weapon in the Gate
     Room?

   [Daniel and Carter look shifty.]

     CARTER
     Oh yeah.

     DANIEL
     Absolutely.

   [Teal'c nods as Daniel and Carter walk away. Technicians in the
   Observation Room are running around looking alarmed.]

   INT--SGC LAB --DAY

   [Daniel places the crystal in a scanner while Carter examines one of
   the shards on the work table. Teal'c watches them.]

     CARTER
     Now, I noticed that the glassy edge where the crystal was melted
     looked a lot like the walls of the Gate room after Apophis and his
     serpent guards came and shot up the place. Now, take a look at this.
     We did a complete study trying to figure out what they used. We kept
     a few pieces and that gave me the idea.

   [Daniel and Teal'c follow Carter as she walks over and sits at a
   computer.]

     DANIEL
     Since your energy weapons are the same as the ones Apophis used, we
     can compare the blast marks on the two crystals.

     CARTER
     Now, I'm telling the computer to build a simulation model. We should
     see if the energy signatures are the same or not.

   [Carter inputs the new data. As the monitor shows the results, the
   crystal behind them seems to glow.]

     CARTER
     Hmm. Matches up.

     TEAL'C
     It was Goa'uld technology that destroyed the crystals.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I'd say a whole mess of the staff weapons did it.

   [Teal'c frowns.]

   INT--SARA O'NEILL'S HOME--DAY

   [The alien O'Neill descends the staircase. Sara calls to him as he
   passes the living room. He stops at the doorway, looking at her.]

     SARA
     We haven't talked about Charlie since he died. Why now? What were
     you doing up there?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Do you remember how much fun Charlie used to have playing
     that...game?

     SARA

     (frowns)
     Baseball?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Baseball. He loved that game.

     SARA
     He loved playing...with you.

   [The alien O'Neill stares at Sara. Dropping his eyes, he turns and
   starts to walk away.]

     SARA
     Jack?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I have to get back to the Stargate.

     SARA
     Back to what?

   [The alien looks at Sara; she stares at him blankly.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Stargate. It's...a...big...round...metal...object...A ring...of
     energy...

     SARA

     (looks away, disgusted)
     You always could spin a line of bull to avoid talking to me.

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     (enters the room and sits down, staring at Sara with concern)
     What's wrong?

     SARA
     I've been crying, that's what's wrong. What's with you?
     Upstairs...I've never seen you like that before. For a second, I
     thought you were going to cry. Where's all that O'Neill military
     bravado?

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     (searching)
     I don't think I have it.

   [Sara smiles, the alien O'Neill smiles back. He turns, as if looking
   for something.]

     SARA
     What?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Smoke?

     SARA
     Oh, my God! Mike left a casserole in for me...

   [Sara runs to the kitchen; the alien O'Neill follows her.]

   INT--SGC LAB--DAY

     CARTER
     The energy signature looks like some kind of gas plasma laser. Wow,
     I'd love to get this into the spectrometer at Stanford.

     TEAL'C
     What is a Stanford?

   [Carter grins and looks back at Teal'c. Across the room, Daniel is
   looking at the largest fragment of crystal.]

     DANIEL
     Hey, did you see this thing inside of it? I didn't think that was
     there before...

   [Inside the crystal, something moves. Then, quickly, the crystal pulses
   and grows outward, forming a face that resembles Daniel's for a second
   before returning to its original state.]

     DANIEL

     Whoa! (he jumps back, startled)
     Je...uh, Captain Doctor! Teal'c!

   [Carter and Teal'c rush to Daniel's side.]

     CARTER
     Yeah?

     DANIEL

     (bouncing nervously, looking almost frightened)
     Uh...Uh...That...was...me. It was me...

     CARTER

     (looking at him)
     Are you okay?

     DANIEL

     Just... (motioning towards the crystal)
     Look...

   [Carter steps closer to the crystal and peers in.]

     CARTER
     My reflection...so?

     DANIEL

     (standing well back)
     Closer...

   [The crystal pulses, and grows again.]

     CARTER
     Holy Hannah!

   [She jumps back, startled. A face remarkably similar to Carter's forms
   in the crystal...and then it speaks with multiple voices.]

     CRYSTAL
     Help us.

     CARTER
     Oh my God.

   [The crystal returns to its former state.]

   INT--STARGATE CONTROL ROOM --DAY

   [There is a mug of coffee sloshing around beside the dialing computer.
   Beyond the coffee, the Stargate is moving, chevrons engaging.]

     HARRIMAN
     Why's it spinning up? No one's due back.

   INT--SGC LABORATORY--DAY

   [Teal'c, Carter, and Daniel are all standing around the crystal,
   staring at it in amazement.]

     DANIEL
     It was trying to communicate with us.

   [Daniel and Carter move closer to the crystal, bending down to look at
   the spot where the face appeared. Behind them, Teal'c looks on, a bit
   more cautious.]

     CARTER
     I don't know the magic password. Do you?

   [Alarm claxons go off.]

     CARTER

     (standing)
     That's the Gate...incoming.

     HARRIMAN

     (over the intercom)
     Off world activation. This is not a drill!

     DANIEL
     I didn't think anyone was due back.

   [Daniel and Carter run from the lab.]

     TEAL'C
     No one is...

   [Teal'c runs after them.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over the intercom)
     Off world activation...this is not a drill! All units report to
     stations. This is not a drill!

   [In the SGC corridors, troops respond. Gathering weapons, they arrive
   in the Gate Room and take up positions in front of the spinning
   Stargate.]

   INT--CONTROL ROOM--DAY

   [Gneral Hammond runs down the stairs from his office, arriving in the
   Control Room just as Daniel, Teal'c, and Carter run in from the
   corridor. The wormhole engages.]

     CARTER
     Where's the iris?

     HAMMOND
     Someone used a remote.

     DANIEL
     Who? We're all here.

     HAMMOND

     Well, whoever it is has our codes.
     (into the microphone)
     Heads up people!

   [In the Gate Room, soldiers aim their weapons at the wormhole. Tension
   rises in both the Gate Room and the Control Room, until O'Neill flies
   through the middle of the Gate. He catches himself and runs a few steps
   down the ramp.]

     O'NEILL

     (waves his arms and yells angrily)
     Hey, what're you guys doing leaving without me?

   [In the Control Room, everyone stares in stunned silence. In the Gate
   Room, O'Neill looks around at the soldiers pointing guns at him. He
   takes off his sunglasses and walks down the ramp, gesturing towards
   them.]

     O'NEILL
     What's with all the ordinance?

     HAMMOND

     (over the microphone)
     Who are you?

   [O'Neill comes to a halt, staring up at him.]

     O'NEILL

     What do you mean, who am I? (He looks around, sounding slightly
     alarmed)
     What the heck's going on here?

     HAMMOND
     Good question. Take him into custody.

   [Two Airmen take a surprised O'Neill by the arms and lead him away.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM--DAY

   [A computer monitor shows O'Neill pacing in an observation cell.]

     O'NEILL

     (looking up at camera)
     Come on, get me out of here!

   [Hammond, Carter, Teal'c, Daniel, and an airman stand expressionless,
   watching the monitor.]

     O'NEILL

     Tell you what, let me put it nicely... (He grabs a chair, stands on
     it and puts his face in the camera, and yells)
     Get me the hell out of here!

   [Teal'c lifts one eyebrow and Carter grins.]

     HAMMOND
     If that isn't O'Neill, I want to know who the hell we're looking at.

     AIRMAN
     We're searching the facility now, sir.

   [In the Observation Room, O'Neill, enraged, picks a pillow off the bunk
   and throws it at the camera.]

   EXT--A PARK--DAY

   [Sara and alien O'Neill are sitting on a picnic table. Between them are
   the remnants of a meal. Sara is still nibbling, watching the alien
   O'Neill from the corner of her eye.]

     SARA
     I'm waiting for you to say "I'm sorry"...or..."I want to get back
     together" or just...whatever's on your mind, anything, just talk to
     me.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     The first time we were together...is this where we came?

   [Sara frowns, with seeming puzzlement.]

     O'NEILL
     You're angry.

     SARA
     Angry...at you? No, I'm not angry.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Good. You were.

     SARA
     When?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     When Charlie died. That's why I left.

     SARA

     (makes a startled exclamation, and shakes her head)
     You son of a bitch. You walked out on me back then because you
     thought I was mad at you? You trying to tell me it's my fault?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     No.

     SARA
     Why didn't you talk to me? Why didn't you ask?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I should have...but I didn't. So, you were angry?

     SARA

     No. Yes. What did you expect? (her voice rises in distress)
     It happened in our house. It was your gun. (She stops, and calms
     herself)
     I know you blamed yourself. But if you just opened up for once and
     let me through that armor of yours...We could have helped each
     other. I needed you.

   [At the end, her voice breaks with emotion.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL

     (looks at her calmly)
     I know.

     SARA
     You know? And you can say it? Just like that? After all this time.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I'm sorry it took so long. It should've been said sooner.

     SARA
     Is that what you came to tell me?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     There's no way to make you understand what I came here to do. You
     couldn't understand.

     SARA
     Try me.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I thought if I could bring Charlie back through the Stargate...

     SARA

     (angrily)
     Just shut up about that, would you! Charlie is gone, Jack. And we
     should be talking about us and what happened and not...

   [The alien O'Neill gets up, walking away from the picnic table. Rays of
   blue energy play over his body. He flinches.]

     SARA
     Jack? My God.

   [The alien O'Neill collapses, seeming to be struck down by blue bolts
   of energy from within. Sara watches, horrified, as he writhes in pain.
   When the blue charge seems to have subsided, she approaches cautiously,
   clearly worried.]

     SARA
     Jack? Jack? What is that? What's happened to you? We've got to get
     you to the hospital.

   [Sara helps the alien O'Neill get to his feet and supports him as they
   move toward the car.]

   INT--SGC OBSERVATION CELL --DAY

   [Doctor Fraiser is leafing through a medical report. O'Neill is sitting
   on a bunk, his feet up, his back against the wall. Hammond is listening
   to Fraiser.]

     FRAISER
     The MRI was negative. The DNA screen matches what we have on file.
     Uh, physical examination of the body shows some trauma...otherwise
     he seems perfectly healthy.

     HAMMOND
     Healthy doesn't cut it.

     FRAISER
     Well, the evidence says he's Colonel Jack O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, Doctor.

     HAMMOND
     Then how do you explain the other one?

     O'NEILL

     What other one?
     (Looking from Hammond to Fraiser)
     What?

   INT--SGC LABORATORY--DAY

   [Hammond, O'Neill, Teal'c, and Carter are clustered around a computer
   monitor. Daniel stands near the door. On the screen is a playback of
   SG-1's return to the SGC...with the alien imitating O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay, so that's not possible. I didn't come back with you guys.

   [Carter works the remote, zooming in on the image of alien O'Neill.
   Teal'c and Hammond watch O'Neill as he leans forward, examining the
   screen with a frown.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell is that thing?

     CARTER
     The E.M. energy in the one intact crystal we brought back from
     P3X-562 may hold the key to this.

     HAMMOND
     Explain.

     CARTER
     The electromagnetic energy in the crystal has the ability to mimic
     things. It recreated Daniel and I. It cloned us electronically,
     at...at least part of us. It seemed to read our thoughts and speech
     and mimicked them too. Now, what if the other O'Neill is energy just
     like the thing Daniel and I found in the crystal...only a more
     powerful, more evolved form of it? One powerful enough to copy a
     whole person, not just faces.

     HAMMOND
     Is that what we're looking at?

     CARTER
     Could be.

     HAMMOND
     And it tried to communicate with you?

     DANIEL
     It asked for our help.

   [O'Neill rubs his forehead, as if it aches. They turn and approach the
   crystal on the other side of the lab.]

     CARTER
     This may not work.

   [Carter approaches the damaged crystal, leaning so that her face is
   close to the center of it.]

     CARTER
     Hello?

   [The crystal moves, and again, a copy of Carter's face appears.]

     CRYSTAL
     Hello.

   [The voice is also a copy of Carter's, although the resonance is
   slightly different. Surprise fills the faces of Hammond and O'Neill,
   who have not seen this before. Carter looks delighted.]

     CARTER
     What are you?

     CRYSTAL
     Energy. Unity. You would describe me thus.

     CARTER
     You asked for help.

     CRYSTAL
     If I remain here, my energy will disintegrate. I must return.

     DANIEL
     Why did you not speak before?

     CRYSTAL
     Fear.

     O'NEILL
     Fear of what?

     CRYSTAL
     The Goa'uld came to our planet long ago. We were not afraid then and
     we tried to greet them. One of them touched us as you did and was
     destroyed by our energy.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's some kind of welcome wagon you got there.

   [Hammond and Carter turn to quickly glare at O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL

     (off their looks)
     Well, it almost killed me.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'ulds must have come through the Gate exploring...

     CARTER
     That's why it was afraid. We look just like them.

     DANIEL
     One of the Goa'ulds was killed?

     CRYSTAL
     They gathered all the Unity in one place...and ended it.

     CARTER
     We confirmed Goa'uld energy weapons did it.

     DANIEL
     Then that pit wasn't a ceremonial place at all. It was some kind
     of...mass grave?

     CRYSTAL
     I can no longer sustain this form.

   [Carter's face is reabsorbed into the crystal as it returns to its
   previous state.]

     O'NEILL
     What was that? Any ideas? Any theories? Explanations?
     Uh...uh...anything?

     DANIEL
     If...you thought that your entire race was destroyed by the Goa'ulds
     as punishment for harming one of them, what would you do if you
     thought it was going to happen again?

   [They all stare at Daniel. O'Neill stares at the crystal, his
   expression thoughtful and worried.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM--EVENING

   [The members of SG-1 are seated around the Briefing table. Hammond is
   approaching his seat at the head when an airman walks in.]

     AIRMAN

     Sir. O'Neill... (he looks at the real O'Neill)
     ...the other guy...is nowhere in the mountain.

   [Hammond dismisses the airman, who pivots and leaves the room. He
   passes Carter as ascending the staircase as he descends.]

     CARTER
     Okay...we've got a problem. I ran some tests on the crystals in the
     lab. Whatever the energy inside the crystal is, it's starting to
     decay. It's ionizing particle radiation.

     DANIEL

     (rises to his feet, alarmed)
     Nuclear radiation?

     CARTER

     It's not constant and the amounts are not dangerous; but if (she
     draws quotation marks in the air)
     O'Neill...It...starts breaking down like the energy in the crystals
     and it's more powerful than what we have here...then anyone nearby
     could get a lethal dose of radiation.

     HAMMOND
     If that's true, we have a very serious problem on our hands. Let's
     hope it's not.

     CARTER
     Uh, something else. I've been thinking about where it went. Sir, it
     was in your locker looking through your personal stuff. Pictures of
     your family...

   [O'Neill jumps to his feet and races to the phone. They all watch as he
   dials it.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, Sara, come on.

   [Sara's answering machine picks up.]

     SARA'S VOICE
     Hi. Can't take your call right now, so please leave a message.

   [O'Neill slams down the receiver, whirling around.]

     O'NEILL
     I've got to get there.

   [He runs down the stairs. Carter and Daniel follow.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR--EVENING

   [Carter, Daniel, and Teal'c follow O'Neill through the corridors. The
   team is dressed in camouflage fatigues.]

     CARTER
     The lab's running tests but I'm pretty sure it's breaking down
     because Earth's electromagnetic field is stronger than the one on
     P3X-562. The difference is tearing it apart.

     DANIEL
     Can we stop it?

     CARTER
     I don't know.

   [Hammond meets them.]

     HAMMOND
     We checked with the local police. No one's at your wife's house. One
     of the local hospitals admitted a J. O'Neill less than an hour ago.

   [Hammond notices Teal'c's staff weapon.]

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, you'll have to leave that here.

     TEAL'C
     I have seen your world. I will need it.

     HAMMOND

     Can't let you take your weapon, Teal'c. (He reaches out and removes
     the staff weapon, handing it to the Airman behind him.)
     You--all of you--will be operating in public so you can't do or say
     anything that reveals the existence of the SGC or the Stargate.

   [With a nod, Hammond pulls something from his pocket. He hands Teal'c a
   baseball cap with "Chicago" inscribed across the front.]

     TEAL'C
     Chicago. The windy city. Home of the Black Hawks, the Bulls and the
     White Sox.

     O'NEILL
     Don't forget the Cubs.

   [The elevator opens, and SG-1 steps on board.]

     HAMMOND
     Heads up Colonel. Good luck.

   INT--HOPSPITAL--NIGHT

   [The alien O'Neill is in the far corner of a large multi-bed Emergency
   Ward. His eyes are closed; his fists are clenched on his chest. Sara is
   at his bedside, looking away. A monitor beeps. Suddenly, the alien's
   eyes fly open.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Charlie...

   [Sara turns quickly to look him. The alien turns on his side, gazing
   back at her. He looks ill; pale and in pain.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     This is the place we brought him.

     SARA
     Yes, it is.

   [The alien sits up; his eyes focused on the past.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     He died here.

     SARA
     Yes, he did. Jack, what's happening to you?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I have to get to the Stargate. Can we do that?

     SARA
     Jack, I know you want to get to the Stargate...but...

   [A blast of energy flashes between them, and the alien O'Neill slams
   back to the bed, in agony. The power flows through him, then seems to
   leave. Sara approaches him, reaching out tentatively to help. The
   energy flares between them and she pulls back, stuck by the electronic
   pulse, hurt and frightened.]

   [The alien O'Neill cries out as the energy runs through him, causing
   pain and disruption. Sara, nurses and patients scream and back away as
   the power flows over the alien, moving into the area around him.
   Electrical shorts and explosions start disrupting the equipment, lights
   and monitors throughout the hospital. The alien falls off the bed, the
   energy becoming worse. All around the ward, medical professionals and
   patients cower and flee.]

   [Sara runs from the room, trying to escape the electrical charges
   blowing out lights and other electrical equipment.]

   EXT--HOSPITAL--NIGHT

   [Chaos and panic fill the air as people are evacuated from the
   hospital. Police are trying to control the crowd. Medical personnel and
   patients mill around ambulances. Local news Channel 8 is trying to
   cover the scene.]

     POLICE OFFICER

     (over his radio)
     All right, people! I need buses up here!
     (to another officer)
     Help this news van get in through the crowd.
     (shouting)
     I want these people out of here now! Come on! Move! Move!

   [The police officer approaches a hospital administrator.]

     POLICE OFFICER
     As soon as Colonel O'Neill's team gives the signal, I want you to
     start shutting the power down inside. All right?

     ADMINISTRATOR
     All right.

   [The officer moves back through the crowd.]

     POLICE OFFICER

     (hitting the news van)
     Move back!

   INT--HOSPITAL CORRIDOR--NIGHT

   [A nurse is winding a bandage around Sara's hand. People pass them,
   moving rapidly through the corridor.]

     SARA
     Thanks...

   [A light flares and flickers, buzzing menacingly. Both women look up.]

     SARA
     Go. I'm all right...go.

     NURSE
     I'm almost finished.

   [Sara looks up as she hears a familiar voice.]

     O'NEILL

     (in the distance)
     All right...keep moving, folks. Everybody out! I need everybody out
     of here now! Let's go!

   [Sara stares in disbelief as O'Neill runs into sight. He seems to be
   searching every face he passes. He is followed by Daniel, Carter, and
   Teal'c.]

     SARA

     (shocked)
     Jack?

   [O'Neill grabs Sara by the shoulders, looking at her intently.]

     O'NEILL
     Sara! Are you all right?

   [Sara looks at O'Neill, her mouth opening and closing in wordless
   shock. She turns to look back to the room where the alien O'Neill is,
   then turns back to the real O'Neill. He hugs her tightly.]

     O'NEILL
     It's me. This is me, baby.

     SARA
     Jack.

   [They hold the embrace, then O'Neill pulls back. He kisses Sara, then
   cups her face in his hands.]

     O'NEILL
     Are you all right?

     SARA
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. I want to hear all about it...but not now. Are you okay?

     SARA
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL

     (to nurse)
     What room?

     NURSE
     Room three.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   [O'Neill turns and moves down the corridor.]

     DANIEL
     Colonel!

   [O'Neill turns, and Daniel throws him the hazmat hood. Surges of
   electrical power cause light and noise in the room at the end of the
   hall. O'Neill jogs toward the room, followed by Teal'c. Carter takes
   Sara by the shoulder and escorts her and the nurse in the opposite
   direction. Daniel stares after O'Neill and Teal'c, then turns and
   follows Carter.]

     CARTER

     (to Sara)
     It's okay.

   INT--HOSPITAL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROOM THREE--NIGHT

   [As O'Neill and Teal'c approach the room, the power is shut off.
   O'Neill pulls on the hazmat hood; Teal'c takes flashlights out of the
   bag has. He hands one to O'Neill and turning them on, they enter Room
   Three. Bursts of blue energy still run over the equipment. They spot
   the alien, crumpled on the floor beside the bed. Blue energy runs over
   him.]

   [Daniel and Carter run down the corridors with flashlights, following
   their teammates' route. Carter is carrying a radiation detector. They
   join O'Neill and Teal'c in Room Three.]

     CARTER

     Listen Colonel; it's buried in the red. (into the radio)
     How we doing with the power?

     ADMINISTRATOR

     (over the radio)
     I turned off as much of the grid as possible.

     CARTER
     They've shut down all they can.

   [O'Neill turns to look at the alien. He moves across the room,
   approaching him cautiously. Looking afraid, the alien sits up, leaning
   against a cabinet. He moves with jerky motions, and looks even worse
   than before. When he speaks, his words are halting, and delivered with
   great effort.]

     O'NEILL

     It's all right. (he pulls out his pistol and places it on the
     ground)
     I'm not going to hurt you.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Please...stay back. I...do not want to...harm you...again. My
     energy...is...about to...

   [The alien screams as sizzling energy bolts bursts forth, throwing
   O'Neill and the others back. O'Neill hits a rack of supplies, and falls
   to the ground. His teammates hit a wall. They stagger to their feet.
   Carter picks up the radiation detector.]

     CARTER
     Radiation has dropped off.

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill...are you all right?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, I'm okay.

   [They look up as the lights come back on.]

     CARTER

     What's happening?

     ADMINISTRATOR

     (over radio)
     We've got twenty percent emergency power.

     CARTER
     Radiation's low enough. We should be all right.

   [SG-1 pull off the hazmat headgear. O'Neill looks at the alien.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     You have come to destroy me.

     O'NEILL

     No. That's not true.
     (He gets to his feet and walks to the alien)
     I know you weren't trying to kill me back on the planet.
     (He kneels in front of the alien, speaking gently)
     The Goa'ulds--the people who destroyed your race--they're our
     enemies too.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     I...understand...Thank you.

     O'NEILL
     Why did you come here?

   [Throughout his speech, the alien flashes back to the moment of their
   first meeting, when O'Neill touched the crystal, and was sent flying.
   When he stood over his unconscious form and reached a decision. The
   moment when Sara and O'Neill heard the gunshot.]

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     When my energy hurt you...I tried...to heal you. But I did not
     understand your...injury. So I looked in...to your mind. I saw the
     mind...of a warrior. I feared it, as I feared those who destroyed my
     race. I tried to make you well...before my mistake was discovered;
     before the others returned to...destroy me. I understand now. Your
     deepest pain was not the physical...injury I had caused. Your pain
     was from an empty place in your heart where Charlie once was. I
     thought if I could bring Charlie to you, it would make you well. I
     did not understand his death meant he could no longer exist as flesh
     and blood. Physical death...does not have the same meaning...to us.

     O'NEILL
     Are you dying now?

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     Yes. I could not bring Charlie to you.

     O'NEILL
     Charlie's gone.

     ALIEN O'NEILL
     No...He's...in here.

   [The alien O'Neill reaches out a hand to touch O'Neill's heart. By the
   time the hand reaches O'Neill, the alien has become a copy of Charlie.
   O'Neill stares at him in disbelief.]

     O'NEILL
     Charlie?

   [O'Neill looks stunned. Around him, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c look on
   with concern.]

     ALIEN CHARLIE
     You cannot change what happened that day, just as I cannot change
     the day that the Goa'uld destroyed my world. I am showing you what
     of Charlie is still there...inside you.

   [O'Neill and the alien Charlie stare at each other in a moment of
   silent communication.]

     DANIEL

     (softly)
     Jack...Jack....

     CARTER
     Radiation's still low, but I don't know for how long.

     O'NEILL

     (to Charlie)
     We have to go.

     ALIEN CHARLIE

     (smiling)
     Is Sara O'Neill still here?

     O'NEILL
     Yes.

   [The alien Charlie grins as O'Neill's eyes travel over his face.]

   INT--HOSPITAL CORRIDOR--NIGHT

   [O'Neill and the alien Charlie walk hand in hand down the hospital
   hallway. Carter, Teal'c and Daniel follow.]

     VOICE OVER THE RADIO
     Delta Five Point Bravo, our ETA is five minutes.

     CARTER
     Chopper's inbound.

     O'NEILL
     You guys go ahead.

   [O'Neill and the alien Charlie approach Sara, who is standing alone in
   front of the hospital exit. She stares at the small form of the alien
   Charlie in shock. He looks up at her with trust.]

     O'NEILL
     Sara.

     SARA
     Oh my God...

     O'NEILL
     It's not Charlie.

   [The alien Charlie looks up at him, then over to Sara.]

     O'NEILL
     Sara...

     SARA
     Shh...

   [The alien Charlie holds out a hand, and Sara takes it with her
   bandaged one. They hold hands for a moment, Sara blinking away tears as
   she drinks in the sight of the boy's face. The alien Charlie pulls his
   hand back gently.]

     O'NEILL
     Sara...I have to get him back.

     SARA

     (nods)
     To the Stargate?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

   [Sara holds back tears and O'Neill wraps her in his arms while the
   alien Charlie looks on, his expression sympathetic.]

     SARA

     (against O'Neill's neck)
     Whatever that is. The other guy...You know what he said?

     O'NEILL

     (softly)
     I have a pretty fair idea.

     SARA
     We were pretty great together, weren't we?

     O'NEILL
     We were the greatest.

   [O'Neill kisses her neck as Sara blinks back more tears. Finally, they
   pull apart. O'Neill caresses her face with one hand while she watches
   him, then breaks contact. He takes the alien Charlie's hand and walks
   through the door, leaving Sara standing there. She turns to watch them
   depart.]

     SARA

     (whispering)
     Take care of yourself, Jack.

     SGC--GATE ROOM--NIGHT

   [O'Neill and the alien Charlie stand in front of the active Stargate.
   Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are watch from the bottom of the ramp.
   O'Neill walks up the ramp, stopping in front of the wormhole to look at
   them with a small smile.]

     O'NEILL
     Keep the lights on. I'll be back.

   [O'Neill reaches out for the alien Charlie's hand. Charlie puts his
   hand in O'Neill's and together, they walk through the wormhole.]

   FADE OUT
