   TEASER

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Various male personnel are distracted as Carter and Vala walk down the
   hall. The two women carry several shopping bags. Vala is dressed in a
   miniskirt, knit top, and very short jacket with boots. Carter wears a
   flowing light brown flowery print dress and high heeled boots. Their
   hair is also coiffed and they both sport earrings.]

   [Mitchell and Siler walk down the hallway from the other direction,
   already in a conversation.]

     MITCHELL

     They cancelled it? Really? I didn't even know the new season had
     started.
     (spotting his teammates)
     Well, there's something you don't see everyday.

   [Behind the two men, a janitor has come out of a supply closet and
   leans a mop against the far wall, leaving the closet door open.]

     SILER

     (stopping short)
     Uh, yes sir.

   [Siler makes an abrupt about face away from the two women, promptly
   colliding with the open door face-first.]

     SILER
     Ooh! Ah!

   [Carter and Vala have reached Mitchell at this point and wince at
   Siler's predicament. Once noting Siler's being taken care of, Mitchell
   turns back to Carter.]

     MITCHELL
     It's a nice outfit.

   [Carter exchanges a smug smile with Vala who nudges Carter with her
   shoulder.]

     MITCHELL
     It's very...um...

     CARTER
     Civilian?

     MITCHELL

     (nonplussed)
     Well, yeah, that's one way of putting it. Huh. So, what is this,
     girls' day out?

   [He gestures to their shopping bags.]

     VALA
     Well, yes, if I'm going to integrate into Earth society, we thought
     it was very important that I immerse myself in the local cultural
     offerings.

     MITCHELL
     Uh, and by "cultural offerings", you mean...

     CARTER
     Pedicures, mochaccinos, and Victoria's Secret.

     VALA

     (nodding)
     Mm-hmm!

     MITCHELL
     Heh. Well, we're scheduled to go offworld in about an hour, and,
     though you both look...fantastic, I suggest you might want to lose
     the heels.

   [Carter starts to speak.]

   [Klaxons blare.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Unscheduled offworld activation!

     MITCHELL
     Ladies first.

   [He gestures for them to precede him. They continue down the corridor.
   Mitchell pauses a moment, watching before following, determinedly
   clasping his hands behind his back.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry is already in the control room with Harriman.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, we're receiving a video transmission.

     LANDRY
     Let's see it.

   [A monitor shows Jacek's face looming into the camera lens.]

     JACEK

     Hello? Hello?
     (taps camera lens)
     Is this thing working?

     LANDRY
     This is General Landry of Stargate Command.

   [Jacek backs away to a normal distance from the lens and smiles
   winningly.]

     JACEK
     Oh, General! It is a pleasure! I don't get out to your end of the
     galaxy much, but I have a friend who lives in the area, and he
     speaks very highly of your people. Uh, maybe you know him. A funny
     little guy with a beard. Uh, lives on a planet formerly occupied by
     a female system lord...

     LANDRY
     I don't uh...

     JACEK
     Um, Rovak? Robak. Does the name sound familiar?

     LANDRY
     No, it doesn't. Now what's this about?

     JACEK

     (serious)
     Sir, I have some information for you. Information that could impact
     the very survival of your world.

   [Vala, Carter, and Mitchell arrive in the control room. Vala stops in
   shock to see Jacek on the screen.]

     VALA
     Jacek?

     LANDRY
     You know this man?

     VALA

     (stiffly)
     A little. He's my father.

   [Vala closes her eyes and sighs as the others give her startled looks.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     JACEK

     (all smiles)
     Vala, is that you?

     VALA

     (sighing)
     Yes, it is.

     JACEK
     Sweetheart! How is life treating you?

     VALA
     Certainly better than you ever did.

     JACEK
     Ouch. Heh heh. I suppose for the benefit of your friends there,
     you're gonna want to list all the reasons why I was such a bad
     father.

     VALA
     Oh, I wish I could, but a wormhole can only be maintained for
     thirty-eight minutes.

     JACEK
     Ha ha. You've got your father's wit.

     VALA
     It's hardly enough time to cover your inadequacies as both a parent
     and a human being in general.

     JACEK
     And your mother's uncanny ability to hold a grudge.

     MITCHELL
     You said you had some information for us?

     JACEK
     Uh, yes! Let me through, and we'll discuss.

     LANDRY
     All right, provided Vala will vouch for you.

     VALA
     I most certainly will not!

     JACEK
     You'll want to hear this. The information I have has to do with
     Arkad's plot to attack your planet.

     CARTER
     Arkad is dead!

     JACEK
     Well he may be dead, but the threat he set in motion still exists.
     Take your time, there's no pressure. Just that your whole planet
     could very well blow up at any moment.

   [Vala scoffs and rolls her eyes.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 is geared up and waits at the base of the ramp for the Stargate
   to finish dialing.]

     MITCHELL
     So, what's the deal with the accent, or in your father's case, the
     lack thereof?

     VALA
     Well, the accent, like most of my other good qualities I got from my
     mother. My charm. My wit. My good looks.

     DANIEL
     What'd you get from your dad?

     VALA
     Some minor food allergies.

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron 7 locked.

   [The wormhole activates, and SG-1 heads out.]

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--UNNAMED PLANET, WOODS, EVENING

   [SG-1 walk through the woods cautiously.]

     VALA
     I have a bad feeling about this.

   [Jacek steps out from behind some foliage.]

     JACEK
     Of course you do. That's because I raised you to be cautious...wary.

     VALA
     Mother raised me.

     JACEK
     Which one?

     VALA

     (looking disgusted)
     My mother.

     JACEK
     Oh. Right. Hug for Daddy?

   [He opens up his arms. Vala remains several feet away, cradling her
   P-90.]

     VALA
     You're lucky I'm not allowed to kill you.

     MITCHELL
     Well, so much for happy family reunions. What do you know about
     Arkad and the attacks he was planning?

     JACEK
     Quite a lot, and I'm prepared to tell you everything I know in
     exchange for sanctuary on Earth.

     VALA

     (unsurprised)
     There's the angle.

     JACEK
     Okay, I was a terrible husband and admittedly probably not the best
     father figure--although I've seen worse! But I've put all that
     behind me because I'm trying to change, trying to better myself.

   [Vala pointedly looks at her watch; Jacek hurriedly continues.]

     JACEK
     Which is why I'm here now, risking my life to tell you that before
     Arkad died, he sent out several naquadah loaded cargo ships in
     preparation for an attack on Earth. And those cargo ships, my
     friends, are still out there, waiting to be launched. And I know
     their location.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1 briefs Landry.]

     VALA
     Can't you see what he's doing? He's spent an entire lifetime taking
     advantage of people, and now that they're finally catching up with
     him, he thinks he can use us to hide from his enemies!

     CARTER
     But that's not really the issue here.

     DANIEL
     No, Sam's right. If Jacek is telling the truth, and there's still a
     bunch of naquadah loaded cargo ships out there, then this deal is a
     no-brainer.

     TEAL'C
     If he is telling the truth.

   [Vala emphatically gestures her agreement.]

     TEAL'C
     Thus far the Jaffa have been unable to corroborate any part of his
     story.

     DANIEL
     Well, they wouldn't if Arkad was careful enough to cover his tracks.

     CARTER
     If the threat is real, we can't let any of those cargo ships blow
     up. Time is of the essence.

     MITCHELL
     Well, there is one way to find out if he's being straight with us.

     LANDRY
     All right. Check it out. If his intel is good, then Jacek has
     himself a deal.

   [Vala groans and rests her head on the table. Daniel gives a sidelong
   glance at her and sighs but leaves her alone as he gets up.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Lam checks out Siler's injured nose. Landry comes to the door.]

     LANDRY

     Dr. Lam?
     (Siler weakly stands.)
     As you were, Sergeant.

   [Siler nods and sits back on the bed.]

     LAM

     (to Siler)
     Excuse me.

   [Lam comes to the doorway with a puzzled expression.]

     LANDRY
     Carolyn, I've been thinking.

     LAM
     Ah, see now, whenever you preface what you're about to say with
     "I've been thinking," what you're actually doing is preparing me for
     some revelation you just had, so should I be sitting down for this?

     LANDRY

     (chuckling)
     It's been a while since I last spoke to your mother.

     LAM
     Yeah, a little over five years.

     LANDRY
     We were married for twelve.

   [Lam bites her lip, studying her father intently.]

     LAM
     What brought this on all of a sudden?

     LANDRY
     Oh, I've been thinking about it ever since you came to work
     here--about reaching out to your mother--at least, opening up some
     kind of communication with her.

     LAM
     Okay. So...how do you want to do this?

     LANDRY

     (shrugging)
     Well, I was thinking about giving her a call.

     LAM

     (scoffing)
     Just like that? Just out of the blue?

     LANDRY
     No?

   [Lam groans and lets out a breath while rolling her eyes upward in
   thought.]

     LAM
     She's in Europe for a couple of weeks. So...when she gets back, why
     don't I call her and...put in a good word for you?

   [Landry gives a hopeful smile.]

     LANDRY
     Thank you.

     LAM

     (with slight smile)
     You're welcome.

   [Lam returns to Siler. Landry gives a hopeful sigh and walks away.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey moves through hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell exits an elevator and walks through the corridors at a fast
   pace. As he rounds one corner, he is startled by Vala leaning against
   the wall waiting for him. She starts walking with him.]

     VALA
     We've come all this way for nothing. The cargo ships won't be there;
     my father will have played you all for fools; and this will have
     been a giant waste of time.

     MITCHELL
     Not entirely. If the ships aren't there, we'll have called his
     bluff. And, you can tell us that you were right all along.

     VALA
     You bet I will.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey drops out of hyperspace near a planet.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [The crew, headed by Col. Davidson, mans their stations. Maj. Marks has
   the port station, Carter the starboard one with Daniel and Teal'c
   standing beside her. Mitchell and Vala join their teammates on the
   bridge.]

     MARKS
     Entering high orbit. Scanning.

     DAVIDSON
     What've we got?

     MARKS
     We're picking up only twelve life signs on the planet's surface.

     DAVIDSON
     That's it?

     MARKS
     We're also picking up a significant concentration of naquadah.

     CARTER
     These readings are through the roof!

     DANIEL
     Looks like the intel's good.

     TEAL'C
     Mmm.

   [Daniel looks at Vala, who glares at Daniel and frowns.]

     MARKS
     Sir, we're picking up movement.

     CARTER
     We've been detected. They're making a break for it.

     TEAL'C
     Those ships must not be allowed to escape.

     DAVIDSON
     Lock onto their position and fire.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey fires several missiles at the planet.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Missiles are tracking. Impact in five seconds.
     Four...three...two...one...impact.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A large explosion can be seen from orbit on the planet's surface. A
   few moments later, a large explosion with a shock wave also happens.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Sir? I'm reading a massive secondary explosion.

     MITCHELL
     How much naquadah was down there?

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Vala and Landry walk down a hall.]

     VALA
     General, you're making a terrible mistake! Uh, with...all...due
     respect, it's not too late to change your mind.

     LANDRY
     I made a deal. I'm not going back on my word.

     VALA
     Then might I suggest a more liberal interpretation of the agreement?
     For instance, the word "sanctuary" could mean anything from
     accommodations in an idyllic tropical setting to say...a lifetime's
     incarceration in one of these planets' more unpleasant penal
     facilities!

     LANDRY
     Forget it.

   [Vala slumps in defeat as the wormhole activates.]

   [Two SG team members stumble through the Stargate, overwhelmed by the
   several large bags they carry. Behind them comes a smiling Jacek,
   carrying nothing. The wormhole deactivates.]

     JACEK
     It's okay, I'll go back for the rest of my stuff later. I tell you,
     travel is becoming more and more difficult everyday.

   [He descends the ramp.]

     LANDRY
     I'm General Landry. Jacek, welcome to Earth.

   [Landry extends his hand to shake Jacek's. Jacek appears unfamiliar
   with the custom. He looks down, then extends his own hand to be
   parallel with Landry's. Landry grabs it and shakes it.]

     JACEK

     Ah. A fresh start on a brand new world! I have a feeling I'm going
     to like it here very much.
     (spots Vala)
     Vala!

   [Jacek clicks his tongue and fires his forefinger at his daughter in a
   familiar gesture, smiling at her. Vala sighs in disgust and looks
   away.]

     VALA
     Ugh.

   INT--SGC, VALA'S QUARTERS

   [Vala lies on her bed in robe, curlers in her hair and a throw pillow
   between her feet. She is lying prone, facing the foot of the bed, and
   flipping through a magazine. Her bed sports a gold patterned comforter
   and there are other hints of personalization, including an
   impressionist painting in a gilded frame above the bed. There is a
   knock at the door.]

     VALA
     Come in!

   [Landry enters, carrying an envelope.]

     VALA
     General!

   [Surprised, Vala puts down the magazine and sits up.]

     LANDRY
     This came for you today.

   [Landry hands her the envelope.]

     VALA
     Oh. Since when did you assume mail delivery duties at the base?

     LANDRY
     It's from your father.

     VALA

     Oh.
     (she throws it into the trash bin)
     I'll just file that away for later.

     LANDRY
     It's been three weeks since he came to Earth, and you've ignored
     every attempt he's made to get in touch with you.

     VALA
     Well, I-I've been...terribly busy.

     LANDRY
     I think family should always come first. I learned that the hard
     way.

     VALA
     How? Were you absent for the first three years of your daughter's
     life because you were too busy running scams out of the Nylus
     sector?

     LANDRY
     No. But I did allow my career to take precedent over the things that
     should've been more important to me: birthdays, anniversaries, my
     daughter's graduation.

     VALA
     No offense, General, but there really is no comparison. You had a
     legitimate occupation. My father's career choice was...decidedly
     less noble. He'd be gone for months at a time, only to return to lay
     low or to hide from the people he had swindled.

     LANDRY
     What were things like when he was at home?

   [Vala pauses from absently fiddling with her curlers. She shrugs
   thoughtfully.]

     VALA
     Well, I...actually looked forward to the times that he would "grace"
     us with his presence. I was young, and he was my father. Sometimes
     he'd return late, in the middle of the night, and I would wake to
     find him asleep at the foot of my bed. I was so excited, I couldn't
     wait until morning, and I would prod him awake and make him tell me
     all about his "great adventures."

     LANDRY
     Hmm.

   [Landry and Vala are both smiling at the recounting of memories.]

     VALA
     He'd always have something for me too: a fancy ring, a pretty
     necklace, things that he'd bring back from his many travels. I
     treasured those keepsakes: memories of my father that I kept stored
     away under my bed...until I was old enough to see them for what they
     really were: worthless trinkets meant to curry my favor.

     LANDRY
     Oh, he might feel differently about that.

     VALA
     You don't know him.

     LANDRY
     No. I don't. But I do know that he spent every day of the last three
     weeks trying to get in touch with you, which tells me that you must
     be very important to him, possibly much more than you know.

   [While Landry speaks, he goes over to the trash bin and pulls out the
   envelope, setting it on the footboard of Vala's bed. He walks over to
   the door.]

     LANDRY
     You have some good memories of the times you spent together when you
     were a little girl. Those times count too.

   [Vala looks back thoughtfully at Landry as he leaves, closing the door
   behind him. After he leaves, she looks down at the envelope.]

   INT--JACEK'S APARTMENT

   [Jacek opens the door to his apartment to find Mitchell and Daniel,
   both dressed in casual civilian garb, standing outside.]

     JACEK
     Oh, Colonel Mitchell, Doctor Jackson! Thanks for coming! Entréz!

   [Daniel and Mitchell enter, looking bemused at the sight before them.]

     MITCHELL
     We interrupting something?

     JACEK
     No, we're just enjoying a quiet little...

   [Elderly ladies are seated around the living room of his apartment,
   studying Bingo cards. One woman spins the ball cage and pulls out
   another ball.]

     HAZEL
     B-10!

     JACEK
     Bingo!

     WOMAN 1
     What?

     WOMAN 2
     B-10?

   [Jacek races back to fetch his card as the other women are still
   concentrating on their cards, verifying the number called. Jacek's
   apartment is filled with cheap tv tray tables and gaudy furniture,
   complete with a large felt painting of a tiger on the wall.]

     JACEK
     All right, ladies, we've got to call it a day.

   [He stamps B-10 on his card and shows them.]

     JACEK
     Come on. Pay the winner! Read 'em and weep. Heh heh.

   [The ladies shake their heads and gather their belongings to leave.
   Some have walkers or oxygen tanks. Jacek walks back over to Daniel and
   Mitchell by the door as the women begin to depart.]

     JACEK
     All fair and square. Every Tuesday and Thursday I host a little
     Bingo afternoon for some of the seniors in the building. Gets them
     out of their apartments.

   [The first woman to leave slams some cash into Jacek's hand.]

     JACEK

     I Thank you. No running in the hall.
     (to Mitchell and Daniel)
     Gives them a chance to socialize. It's good for them.
     (loudly to ladies as he takes more cash)
     No loud parties after midnight.
     (low, to Daniel)
     Bless their decrepit little hearts.
     (to another woman as he accepts money)
     That's it. Be careful. Lot of cross traffic in the halls today.

   [Hazel is the last to leave, she slams a few dollars into Jacek's hand
   as she tries to rush out the door.]

     JACEK
     Whoa, whoa, Hazel! You're a little light!

   [Hazel is irked she is caught, but dutifully reaches into her purse for
   some more money. Jacek turns to Daniel and Mitchell, but his voice is
   clearly audible to Hazel.]

     JACEK

     (chuckling)
     Money "confuses" her when it's going out.

   [Hazel glares at Jacek as she gives him the remaining cash owed.]

     JACEK

     See you next time.
     (yells out the door)
     Oh, uh, same time Thursday! And to make up for today, I'm waving the
     cover charge!

   [Hazel looks back and shakes her head annoyed as Jacek turns his back.
   Mitchell and Daniel close the door.]

     JACEK
     Yes, settling in quite nicely. Thanks.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, we heard you haven't exactly been a...model citizen.

     JACEK
     I'm not sure what you're referring to.

     DANIEL
     The charity phone scam? Little "Pepito" needs a new set of kidneys?

     JACEK
     Right. Uh, well, you see, the Air Force provides me with a mere
     pittance. It's hardly enough to live on. I'm just looking to
     supplement my income...

   [Mitchell and Daniel look unmoved.]

     JACEK
     Okay, there've been a few lapses in judgment, but darn it, I'm
     working on it! And I just wish Vala could see that! That's where you
     guys come in!

   [He slaps Daniel in the chest with the cash in his hand.]

     MITCHELL
     Yeah, we figured that's why you asked us over.

     JACEK
     Well, you're her friends. She trusts you.

     DANIEL
     You want us to talk to her for you?

     JACEK
     Well, I was gonna suggest tricking her into coming here, but if you
     really think talking'll work...?

   [Daniel and Mitchell say nothing, Mitchell pointedly looking at the
   floor while Daniel sighs.]

     JACEK
     Please guys, I really need to see my little girl.

   [Mitchell sighs. Jacek fans his cash.]

     JACEK
     If it's a matter of expenses, uh, we can talk about that later if
     you get my drift.

   [Mitchell and Daniel look at him, incredulous.]

     JACEK
     We're not putting anything on paper, of course. But, uh, give it
     some thought, I'd appreciate it.

   [Daniel sighs.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [Lam knocks on the open door jamb, looking excited. Landry is by his
   credenza looking at a file.]

     LAM
     Good news! Uh, I got a call from Mom, and she will be in Colorado
     Springs on Friday.

     LANDRY

     (stunned)
     She will?

     LAM
     Yes. She's passing through, and she's agreed to have dinner with
     you.

     LANDRY
     She has?

     LAM
     Well, so long as I come along, yeah.

   [Lam bounces on her toes slightly. Landry continues to have a "deer in
   headlights" shocked expression.]

     LANDRY
     Oh.

   [Lam bites her lip and studies her father.]

     LAM
     Okay, I thought you'd be thrilled.

     LANDRY

     (regaining composure)
     Oh, no. I am. No, that's-that's great news.

     LAM
     Okay, uh, so I'll make a dinner reservation for Friday night
     somewhere...nice?

   [Landry nods and makes agreeable, but not completely intelligible
   noises.]

     LAM

     (nodding)
     Okay.

   [She heads out, but turns around at the doorway.]

     LAM
     Oh, and, um, you know that brown sports jacket that you have with
     the patches on the sleeves?

     LANDRY

     (smiling and nodding)
     Mm-hmm.

     LAM

     (shakes her head)
     Don't wear that.

   [She gives her father a stern look. Landry stops smiling. Lam nods and
   leaves.]

   INT--SGC ELEVATOR AND CORRIDOR

   [Vala stands by elevator doors. The doors open to show Mitchell and
   Daniel in the elevator, startled to see her right in front of them.]

     VALA
     Where have you been?

   [Daniel glances at Mitchell.]

     DANIEL

     Uh...
     (sigh/sputters)
     Your father's place.

   [They trade places so now Vala is in the elevator, and the two men are
   in the corridor.]

     VALA
     So, he wanted you to talk to me on his behalf, didn't he?

     MITCHELL
     Yeah. Look, he really wants--

     VALA

     (interrupting)
     You needn't bother.

     DANIEL
     Look, you two obviously have some unresolved issues...

     VALA
     I've already decided to pay him a visit.

   [She presses the button to make the elevator doors close, leaving
   Daniel and Mitchell to exchange confused looks.]

   INT--JACEK'S APARTMENT

   [There is a knock at the door.]

     JACEK
     Coming.

   [Jacek looks through the peephole and gasps in delight when he sees
   it's Vala. He moves over to the mirror hanging beside the door where he
   checks his hair and combs his eyebrows. Vala knocks again.]

     JACEK
     I'm coming!

   [He opens the door. Vala wears casual civilian clothes.]

     JACEK
     Well, this is a surprise.

   [Vala waves him back as she walks in and moves to the far side of the
   living room.]

     VALA

     (serious, her voice quavering)
     I have not come seeking reconciliation, or some deeper understanding
     of your contemptible behavior in my formative years. I have come for
     one thing and one thing only.

     JACEK

     (grinning)
     Well, if it's chicken casserole, you're in luck, because I just--

     VALA

     (ignoring him)
     Catharsis! To that end:
     (takes a deep breath)
     How dare you implicate yourself in my life after all these years?
     You were never there for Mother! Even though you always expected us
     to be there for you, whenever you needed a-a place to hide or-or
     capital to help set up one of your latest scams! My life has been a
     constant struggle against the personal issues that you seeded! And
     now that I am at Stargate Command and I am finally happy with who I
     am, you think you can come along and jeopardize everything I've
     worked so hard to achieve! Under no circumstances will I allow you
     to screw that up for me!

   [She takes another deep breath.]

     JACEK
     Wow! Did you rehearse that?

     VALA

     (nodding, breathless)
     A little.

   [Jacek nods and bites his lip. Vala turns and looks at him, still
   hurt.]

     VALA
     Right. I'm done.

   [She moves back to the door to exit.]

     JACEK
     That's it? You're gonna leave? But I made pie!

     VALA
     Well, I've...said everything I needed to say.

     JACEK

     (hopeful)
     But if it was just a matter of getting all that off your chest, you
     could've just as easily...sent me a letter! But you went to the
     effort to come see me.

     VALA
     Coming here was only to please my friends at Stargate Command and
     stop them from giving me any more unsolicited advice.

     JACEK
     Yes, it must be wonderful to have friends who care about you,
     support you in times of need, who believe in you.

     VALA

     (holding back tears)
     I earned their trust.

     JACEK
     At least...you had the opportunity. You won't even give me that.

     VALA
     You don't deserve it.

     JACEK
     I don't suppose there's anything I could say or do that would
     convince you that I'm not lying? That I'm honestly trying to change?

   [Vala straightens herself with dignity.]

     VALA
     No, there isn't.

   [She turns to the door.]

     JACEK
     Well, then, before you go, this is for you.

   [He holds up a gold necklace with a small copper-like pendant and
   dangles it in front of her. Vala pauses and looks at the jewelry with
   an uncertain expression.]

     JACEK
     I got it from a trader on Meronat. You know, that little world with
     the twin suns I used to take you to?

     VALA

     (wistful)
     I remember Meronat.

     JACEK
     You still have your little treasure box? Where you would store all
     the gifts I used to bring you when you were just a little girl?

   [Vala shuffles her feet uncomfortably, less able to retain her
   composure. She shakes her head, not looking directly at Jacek.]

     VALA
     Nooo...I threw that away a long time ago.

     JACEK
     Ah. I understand. Well, thanks for coming. And even though it's too
     late, I want you to know...I'm sorry.

   [Vala gives a sad smile but says nothing. She turns to go, but can't
   open the door. She bangs her head against it and groans.]

     JACEK
     Having second thoughts?

     VALA
     No. I think the door is locked.

     JACEK
     Ah. It sticks a little.

   [He reaches around her and jiggles the handle to get the door to open.]

     JACEK
     There you go.

     VALA
     Goodbye, Jacek.

   [Vala walks out of the apartment.]

     JACEK
     For once in the last twenty years, could you call me "Dad"?

     VALA
     You haven't earned that right yet.

   [She walks away. Jacek's expression brightens.]

     JACEK
     "Yet"!

     VALA

     (calling back)
     I'll be in touch.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 19

   [Vala walks down the hallway smiling and with a bounce to her step.
   Carter, in her lab, spots her and comes to the door to call out to
   her.]

     CARTER
     Vala! I think you're gonna want to see this.

   INT--CARTER'S LAB

   [Vala joins Carter in looking at a computer monitor.]

     CARTER
     I found this on the internet.

   [On the screen, Jacek appears in a bright colored suit advertising in
   an "infomercial", complete with cheesy visual effects, music, and cheap
   props.]

     JACEK

     (on monitor)
     It's time to tap into the source by unlocking the power of stardust!
     Ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, genuine stardust...

   [A model's hands highlight the vials. Vala watches and stiffens.]

     JACEK

     (continuing on screen)
     The very same stardust celebrities and professional athletes use to
     tap into the power of the alpha force--the core energy of the
     universe. Tap into the source. Each specially treated vial contains
     four full grams of authentic stardust for only $19.95! That's only
     Nineteen Dollars and Ninety-Five Cents for a vial of genuine
     stardust!...

   [A blinking $49.95 is crossed out and replaced with $19.95. Vala walks
   away from the monitor with a determined gait. Carter watches her go
   with a sympathetic look.]

     JACEK

     (continuing on screen)
     Tap into the source! Order now!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Jacek sits in a chair wearing a casual shirt printed with different
   types of fish. Mitchell looms over him, seated on the table. He clicks
   the remote to turn off the "Stardust" ad. Jacek squirms uncomfortably
   in the chair.]

     JACEK

     (chuckling uncomfortably)
     Huh. It wasn't real stardust.

     MITCHELL
     That's the point. You're running a scam.

     JACEK
     Well, now that's a matter of interpretation. The way I see it, I'm
     selling people "hope".

     MITCHELL
     No. You're selling glitter shavings in a tube for twenty bucks a
     pop.

     JACEK
     Plus shipping and handling.

     MITCHELL
     Look, you are a guest on this planet. And as long as you are a
     "guest", you're gonna follow some rules!

     JACEK
     Oh, come on. A guy's gotta make a living. Next thing you know,
     you're gonna tell me I can't publish my diet book! It's an eat for
     your eye color diet. I just lined up a publisher!

     MITCHELL
     We're killing the book deal, and if you keep this up, the next deal
     we kill is gonna be the one with you!

     JACEK

     (frustrated)
     Fine! No more scams.

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c is waiting to escort you out.

     JACEK

     (resigned)
     Yes. I-I appreciate this second chance.

     MITCHELL
     Third chance.

     JACEK
     Are you sure? I could've sworn it was...oh, right. "Pepito."

   [He chuckles and slaps Mitchell on the shoulder as he walks towards his
   security escort.]

     JACEK

     (to SF)
     Come this way. Ha ha. Do you play poker? Are you familiar with the
     game Twenty-One? Blackjack?

   [Mitchell shakes his head as Jacek and the guard leave.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Teal'c leads Jacek from the control room.]

     TEAL'C
     May I offer you a word of advice?

     JACEK

     (charmingly to passing female airman)
     Hello.
     (to Teal'c)
     Any input that would help me better myself would be greatly
     appreciated.

   [Teal'c runs his access card to summon the elevator.]

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps three words. Be less annoying. If you have no intention of
     reforming your ways, which I suspect that you do not, perhaps it is
     best that you have nothing more to do with your daughter.

     JACEK
     Let me tell you something, big boy! My daughter and I have an
     understanding! An unspoken bond that...

   [Jacek's tone becomes less belligerent as Teal'c turns to glower at him
   face to face.]

     JACEK

     She'll get over it.
     (spots Vala rounding the corner)
     Vala! Are you free on Friday night? Say yes. I got two tickets to
     this "Virginia Dialogues" show. I don't know much about it, but the
     tickets are very hard to get.

   [Vala at first froze when she spotted Jacek, but continues walking,
   mortified and hunching her shoulders to try and not listen as she
   quickly moves to the control room. The elevator door opens and Teal'c
   enters, holding the door for Jacek.]

     VALA
     Oh, to think I was just starting to believe in you!

   [Vala stomps up the stairs, not looking back.]

     JACEK
     I'm trying to change. It's an ongoing process.

   [He sighs, then notices Teal'c holding the elevator door. He quickly
   gets inside.]

     JACEK

     (eyeing Teal'c)
     So what are you doing Friday night?

   [Teal'c looks at him as the elevator doors close.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel studies a book, taking notes. He barely notices as Vala comes
   in lugging a large box full of more books.]

     VALA
     Well, that's the last of them.

   [She unkinks her shoulders and turns to leave.]

     DANIEL

     (absently)
     Thank you.
     (glances up)
     Vala, um...have a seat please?

   [Vala grabs a stool and waits with a curious expression. Daniel
   finishes taking his notes, then turns to her.]

     DANIEL
     How you doin'?

     VALA

     (shrugging)
     Fine. Why wouldn't I be?

     DANIEL
     Well, you're obviously...disappointed.

   [Vala gasps in realization.]

     VALA
     Oh, right! Yeah, uh, no. Not in Jacek. His actions didn't really
     surprise me. More in myself for even considering the possibility
     that he might be telling the truth.

     DANIEL
     Maybe he was.

     VALA
     No, he lied. He said he was trying to change.

     DANIEL
     Well, change isn't easy. I think you of all people should know that.

     VALA
     Right, so you want to draw parallels between him and I: our equally
     disreputable pasts, our similar desires to reform.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, there's that.

   [Vala sighs.]

     VALA
     Daniel, I'm a different person than I was two years ago because I
     genuinely wanted to change. I didn't see it as means of escape.

   [She stands.]

     DANIEL
     No. So you're telling me your decision had nothing to do with the
     desire to stop running and live a semi-normal life?

     VALA
     You don't know Jacek the way I do.

     DANIEL
     No, you're right. In fact, you probably know him better than you
     think. After all, you better than anybody must know what it's like
     to have to resist the temptation of falling back on your old ways.
     I'm sure it hasn't been easy for you either.

   [Vala ponders Daniel's words unhappily.]

   INT--HALLWAY OUTSIDE JACEK'S APARTMENT

   [Daniel and Vala stand outside Jacek's door. Vala knocks.]

     VALA
     Jacek, it's Vala!

     DANIEL
     Should we come back?

     VALA
     Nooo. Excuse me.

   [Vala pulls lock picking tools out of her sleeve and plays with the
   lock. Daniel sighs and rolls his eyes. The door opens after a few
   seconds, perhaps even unlocked. Vala looks disappointed.]

     VALA
     Too easy.

   INT--JACEK'S APARTMENT

   [Vala and Daniel enter the apartment. Vala wandering through the living
   room and kitchen.]

     VALA
     Jacek? "Dad?"

   [She enters the bedroom while Daniel looks down the hall to the
   bathroom.]

     DANIEL

     (calling)
     Hello?
     (to Vala)
     He's not in here.

   [Vala, after a slight hesitation, delicately moves Jacek's boxers where
   they are arranged on the bed. She uncovers a device and grabs it,
   slapping it onto Daniel's chest; he catches it awkwardly.]

     VALA
     Ugh. I knew it. He's removed his ankle monitor. I told you he's been
     playing you for fools all along!

     DANIEL
     Actually, you were starting to believe him too.

   [Daniel fumbles for his cell phone.]

     VALA
     If he decided to leave, it's unlikely we'll find him again.

     DANIEL
     I wouldn't be so sure about that. During his initial physical, Dr.
     Lam implanted him with a subcutaneous transmitter...just in case.

   [Vala blinks in surprise, then her expression turns to growing anger as
   she turns to face Daniel, who has by now dialed his cell phone.]

     VALA
     You didn't trust him, but you talked me into coming here anyway?

     DANIEL

     Eh, he's not my father.
     (into phone)
     Sam, it's Daniel.

   [Vala huffs in exasperation.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Mitchell and Teal'c enter the control room. Carter is already at a
   computer terminal.]

     MITCHELL
     What's going on?

     CARTER
     Jacek's on the run. His locator signal places him approximately six
     miles west of Colorado Springs.

     TEAL'C
     Have we dispatched a team to the area?

     CARTER

     Yeah. Daniel and Vala just got there.
     (into comm)
     Daniel?

   EXT--PARK, DAY

   [Daniel and Vala get out of an SUV and start walking down a park
   trail.]

     DANIEL

     (into phone)
     We're parked, and we're proceeding on foot.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter's computer monitor shows a grid section of a satellite close-up
   of the park. Two blue dots are near the edge of the woods and moving
   rapidly towards a red dot.]

     CARTER
     You're headed right for him.

   EXT--PARK, DAY

   [Daniel and Vala take cover behind a large tree as they spot Jacek
   further up the trail, speaking to a lone man who faces away from them.]

     JACEK
     Well, let-let's start over again. There's seven total. Three for
     you. Three for me. One for me. It's for the house, as we call it.

   [Daniel turns back to Vala.]

     DANIEL

     (sotto voce)
     I didn't know your father had any friends here on Earth.

     VALA

     (sotto voce)
     Neither did I.

   [Daniel releases the safety and cocks his Beretta before slowly and
   quietly moving out into the open. Jacek does not notice Daniel's
   movements and remains engrossed in speaking to his companion.]

     JACEK
     You can't go back on this deal. We had an arrangement. Do you have a
     superior I could talk to?

     DANIEL
     Jacek?

   [The man with Jacek spins and fires a zat blindly. It misses Daniel,
   who returns fire, killing the man. Daniel keeps his gun pointed at the
   man. Vala ducks out, shoving her father aside as she walks to the dead
   man, lifting his cap to reveal a Jaffa tattoo on his forehead.]

     VALA
     Jaffa.

   [Daniel grimaces and turns his pistol from the dead Jaffa to Jacek.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1 briefs Landry. Landry picks up a small handheld alien device.]

     CARTER
     Jacek was carrying that with him. It's a short range communicator he
     probably used to contact the Jaffa.

     VALA
     No doubt he snuck it in with his personal effects.

     MITCHELL
     Turns out we didn't destroy all of the ships intended for the
     attack. One of them was dispatched early, and it's been sitting
     somewhere here on Earth waiting for the order to strike.

   [Vala shoots a smug, knowing look to Daniel, who raises his eyebrows in
   surprise.]

     LANDRY
     And he knew this all along?

     DANIEL
     He got his intel from some heavily involved Jaffa who were having
     second thoughts about the whole thing. Apparently, he knew them from
     some "weapons smuggling operation" he used to run?

     VALA
     Mmm.

   [Vala and Daniel exchange humorless smiles.]

     CARTER
     He found out about the cargo ships and made a deal with us so he
     could come to Earth.

     MITCHELL
     Where he made a deal with the Jaffa: they'd give him the naquadah,
     he would sell it, and they would split the proceeds. Nice and tidy.

     LANDRY
     Where's this cargo ship located?

     MITCHELL
     He doesn't know. The Jaffa he was with was his contact, and he's
     gone so...

     VALA
     Can't we just locate this cargo ship the same way we did the others?

     DANIEL
     No, that won't work this time. This particular cargo ship is
     cloaked, so doing an orbital scan won't reveal any trace of the
     naquadah.

     CARTER
     But, Jacek claims that Arkad marked the naquadah to make sure that
     none of his men would try to double-cross him. He says he can
     calibrate our detection systems to pick up its unique energy
     signature.

   [Vala grins and shrugs as if all this was expected.]

     VALA
     Just out of interest, what did he ask for in return?

     MITCHELL
     Uh, we recover the naquadah, we give it to him, he sells it, and we
     split the profits, fifty-fifty.

   [Vala rolls her eyes and nods.]

     LANDRY
     And what was your counteroffer?

     MITCHELL
     He gets zero, and we don't lock him away for the rest of his life...
     He took the offer.

     VALA
     Hmm.

   INT--BILL LEE'S LAB

   [Lee and Carter work on separate laptops on opposite sides of the
   table. Jacek leans over Lee's terminal.]

     JACEK
     See, you've cast too wide a variance. If you just narrow the
     parameters.

     LEE

     Narrow the...parameters.
     (He types a few keys)
     Ah, that's genius!

   [Carter gives the men a skeptical look before looking again at her own
   screen.]

     JACEK
     Oh, I don't know about genius. Just marginally brilliant.

   [Jacek slaps Lee on the back familiarly while Lee smiles.]

     LEE
     Now if I can just figure out how to sync it up.

   [Lee continues typing. Jacek walks over to stand across from Carter's
   station.]

     JACEK

     (to Lee)
     Aw, I'm sure it'll come to you.
     (to Carter)
     So, how are the readings coming along?

     CARTER
     Slowly.

     JACEK
     It's no wonder. I don't mind telling you, I'm a little disappointed
     in this facility. I was expecting more.

   [Carter looks around the lab and then nods her head in agreement.]

     CARTER
     Well, at times, so do we. But the truth is the Stargate Program just
     doesn't get the support it used to from the people in charge.

     JACEK
     Why not?

   [Carter opens her mouth to respond, but Lee interrupts.]

     LEE
     Eureka! One down, twelve to go!

   [Lee claps his hands in delight and looks at Carter and Jacek before
   turning back to his own work.]

     JACEK
     That's too bad. Because after all your Stargate program has
     accomplished for this network of planets, I would think the decision
     makers would show it the respect it deserves.

     CARTER

     (shrugging)
     Yeah.

     JACEK
     Say, how'd you like to go out to dinner with me once this is all is
     over?

     CARTER

     (shocked)
     Oh, I don't think so.

     JACEK
     Why not?

     CARTER
     Well, I'm an incredibly busy person with very little free time...
     Oh! And you're a jerk.

     JACEK
     Oh, of course there's that. Look, I'm sorry I had to trick you. But
     if you'd known what I had planned, you would've never let me on this
     planet.

     CARTER
     I'm talking about the way you treated Vala. To think that for the
     first time since she was a child she was actually beginning to trust
     you.

   [Jacek shifts and looks nonplussed by this assertion.]

   Landry answers.]

     LAM
     Hi, just calling to remind you about dinner tonight.

     Dinner? Tonight?

     LAM
     You forgot?

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

   [The rest of the conversation switches from Lam and Landry's point of
   view.]

     LANDRY
     Oh. No-no. No. It's just that something very important has come up.
     I think we might be better off rescheduling.

     LAM
     Mom heads back tomorrow morning. We can't reschedule.

     LANDRY
     I'm dealing with a major situation here.

   [Lam pauses and puts her hand over the mouthpiece, looking around the
   infirmary notably empty of patients and makes a determined effort to
   control her temper.]

     LAM
     Okay...what do you want me to tell her?

     LANDRY

     (after a pause)
     Tell her I'll be there.

   [In the infirmary, Lam looks at the phone, incredulous.]

   [In Landry's office, Carter knocks at the open door and she and Jacek
   enter as Landry hangs up.]

     CARTER
     Sir, we finished calibrating the device, and we've got a lock on
     their location. They're approximately...thirty miles outside
     of...Cheyenne Mountain.

   [While Carter speaks, both she and Landry are distracted by Jacek
   picking up the sword decorating Landry's desk and playing with it, as
   if assessing its value.]

     CARTER

     (continuing)
     It seems that one of the targets was the Stargate.

   [Landry stands.]

     LANDRY
     Tell them I'll send in some tactical units.

   [Carter nods, but Jacek raises a finger.]

     JACEK
     I wouldn't. If the Jaffa suspect they're about to be compromised, I
     have no doubt they'll detonate the naquadah. Uh, I would suggest
     using a little stealth and cunning to take them off-guard. And I'd
     be happy to help out.

     LANDRY
     No thanks.

   [Landry smiles and picks up the phone, dialing an extension.]

     JACEK
     Well, like it or not, you're gonna need my help. Some of these Jaffa
     know me, they trust me...and there's also the matter of the rigged
     cargo ship.

   [Landry puts down the phone and looks at Carter expectantly. She looks
   surprised.]

     CARTER
     This is the first I've heard of it, sir.

     JACEK
     Are you sure? I thought I'd mentioned it. According to Te'rak, the
     cargo ship is rigged to blow in the event of anyone tries to move
     it. Now, fortunately for you, I have the override code.

   [Landry and Carter exchange looks.]

     JACEK
     Please, General. Let me help! Give me this one final shot at
     redemption.

   [Landry sighs.]

   EXT--WOODS, DAY

   [Vala, wearing one of her black leather outfits, and Jacek, wearing his
   traveling gear, walk through the forest.]

     JACEK
     Oh, this is nice. It reminds me of that afternoon we spent on
     Serras- Dia.

   [Vala laughs without humor.]

     VALA
     Running for our lives from the authorities.

     JACEK
     You've got to admit, it was great daddy-daughter time.

     VALA
     As I recall, we would not have been on the run had you not been
     greedy and gone back for seconds.

     JACEK
     I couldn't help myself.

     VALA

     (sighing in frustration)
     You know you couldn't even pull off this simple naquadah deal
     without complicating things with your silly little side scams. You
     always were so sloppy!

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Vala.

     VALA

     (into radio)
     Yes, Sam?

   INT--ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS, DAY

   [Mitchell, Carter, and Daniel, armed and wearing full SG field gear
   wait in another section of the forest. All their identifying patches
   have been removed. Carter studies a scanner.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     The naquadah signal is emanating approximately a half-mile north of
     your position.

     VALA

     (over radio)
     I'll confirm visual sighting. Requesting radio silence.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Personnel are at their various stations. Landry stands by Harriman's
   station.]

     TEAL'C

     (over comm)
     Stargate Command, this is Teal'c. I have delivered the package to
     the appointed area.

     LANDRY
     Good. Keep me apprised of any developments.

   [Landry checks his watch and makes a face.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir, do you have to be somewhere?

   [Landry glares at Harriman, who looks away and adjusts some controls.]

   INT--WOODS, VALA AND JACEK'S POSITION, DAY

   [Jacek and Vala keep walking down the trail.]

     JACEK
     Whatever happened to that boy you used to like? The one whose father
     was a merchant? I always thought you two would end up together.

     VALA
     Veron Karn?

     JACEK

     (nodding affirmatively)
     Mmm.

     VALA

     (incredulous)
     We were ten...?

     JACEK
     Mmm.

     VALA
     And he moved away.

     JACEK
     Aw, that's too bad. I saw a lot of potential in him.

     VALA
     Could you stop trying to endear yourself to me? As far as I'm
     concerned, you're a lost cause, and I wouldn't be surprised if you
     were somehow involved in Arkad's plot against Earth.

     JACEK
     Oh, that would be low, even for me.

     VALA
     I have no idea what you're capable of.

   [They stop as they hear the sound of a staff weapon being primed. Vala
   unholsters her zat and aims it as a Jaffa comes out of the foliage. The
   sound of more staff weapons being primed is heard and more Jaffa
   appear, all armed and clearly outnumbering the pair.]

     JACEK

     (unthreateningly)
     Uh, hey fellas, it's me, Jacek. Uh, me and my partner. Actually, my
     daughter--isn't she pretty?... We're here to check out the
     merchandise, is that okay?

   [Vala reholsters her zat and sighs.]

     DE'VIR
     There's been a change of plans, Jacek. And unfortunately, you're no
     longer part of this new arrangement.

   [Vala exchanges a rueful look with her father.]

   INT--WOODS, MITCHELL, CARTER, AND DANIEL'S POSITION, DAY

     VALA

     (over radio)
     Oh, Jacek you idiot.

     DANIEL
     That's the signal.

     MITCHELL
     Let's go.

   [Mitchell and Daniel rush towards Vala and Jacek's position. Carter
   checks the readings on her scanner and heads off in another direction.]

   EXT--WOODS, VALA AND JACEK'S POSITION, DAY

     VALA
     Look, there's no need for you to...carry on with your attack,
     because Arkad is dead and there's no need to sacrifice yourselves.

     JACEK
     Or the naquadah! Let's talk deal.

     DE'VIR
     I believe that was Te'rak's intention...before he disappeared.

     JACEK
     Really? I-I hope he's all right. He-he probably just got lost. These
     woods are...very confusing. You can get turned around so easily...

     DE'VIR
     Enough!

   [De'vir points his staff weapon at Vala who takes a deep breath.]

     JACEK
     Wait. I-I can't watch my daughter die.

   [The Jaffa point their weapons at Jacek.]

     JACEK
     I can't watch me die either.

   [Jacek winces in anticipation as De'vir primes his weapon. Behind the
   Jaffa, Mitchell stands and fires his P-90 once into the air. The Jaffa
   instantly turn to the new threat. De'vir glances back but then turns to
   fire at Jacek. Vala tackles him out of the way, and both fall behind
   some cover, unhurt.]

     JACEK
     Thanks, honey.

   [Daniel and Mitchell exchange fire with the Jaffa.]

     MITCHELL
     Vala! Get to the ship.

   [Vala shoots her zat a few times as cover fire while she and Jacek make
   their escape.]

   INT--CLEARING, WOODS, DAY

   [A Jaffa stands watch over an apparently empty clearing. He is shot
   from behind by Vala's zat and crumples forward, face down. Vala and
   Jacek approach. Vala reaches down and grabs a small rock, throwing it
   into the clearing. A ripple appears, showing the location of the
   cloaked tel'tak.]

     VALA

     (into radio)
     I've located the cargo ship.

   [Vala starts to approach the ship. Jacek pulls her back.]

     JACEK
     Hold it. The naquadah on that ship is rigged to blow unless I input
     the override code Te'rak gave me.

   [Vala shrugs and nods.]

     VALA
     All right. I'm coming with you.

     JACEK
     No, I'm not going to risk your life too!

   [Vala sighs. Jacek grabs her arms and shakes her slightly.]

     JACEK
     Listen to your father for once. Here. In case...I don't make it.

   [Jacek holds up the necklace he tried to give Vala earlier. This time,
   Vala takes it from him. Jacek clicks his tongue and points at his
   daughter. After an emotional pause, Vala reluctantly imitates the
   gesture and watches Jacek go.]

   INT--WOODS, BATTLE AREA, DAY

   [Daniel and Mitchell move away from the cover. All of the Jaffa lie
   dead or badly wounded throughout the area.]

   INT--TEL'TAK

   [Jacek pats the boxes of cargo before moving to the pilot's chair. He
   hits his head on the windshield as he sits.]

     JACEK
     Ugh. Drat. Ah.

   [Jacek powers up the controls.]

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [Vala watches as the tel'tak uncloaks and flies away. She sighs and
   keys her radio.]

     VALA

     (into radio)
     Jacek?

   INT--TEL'TAK

     JACEK

     (into comm)
     Sorry, sweetheart. There never was an override code. Take care of
     yourself. Daddy loves you.

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [Vala closes her eyes, tamping down any emotions. After composing
   herself, she strides over to the Jaffa guard she had stunned with her
   zat.]

     VALA
     Hey.

   [She slaps him on the back, and when he doesn't respond, she rolls him
   over with effort. The Jaffa "guard" is Teal'c, who groans in pain and
   holds his head.]

     VALA
     You okay?

     TEAL'C

     (groaning)
     Yes. Did everything go as planned?

     VALA

     It did on our end.
     (keying radio)
     Sam?

   INT--ANOTHER CLEARING, DAY

   [Carter stands by an uncloaked cargo ship.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     The real cargo ship is secure.

   [Daniel and Mitchell join Carter by the ship.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Guess we won't be needing that override code?

   INT--CLEARING, VALA AND TEAL'C POSITION, DAY

   [Vala pauses and struggles with her emotions for a bit.]

     VALA

     (into radio)
     No, you won't.

     CARTER

     (over radio, sympathetically)
     Sorry, Vala.

     VALA
     Come on.

   [She taps Teal'c in the chest and helps him to his feet.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     MITCHELL

     (over radio)
     We're all good, sir.

     LANDRY

     Glad to hear it. Good job SG-1. An--
     (looks at his watch and panics)
     Landry out!

   [Landry rushes out of the room. Harriman watches him go in puzzlement,
   then shrugs and turns back to his controls.]

   INT--BISTRO 5 RESTAURANT, COLORADO SPRINGS

   [Landry, wearing a dark civilian suit, rushes inside and frantically
   looks around the restaurant. When a staff member moves, he spots Lam
   sitting alone at a table. He smiles and starts to approach. Lam spots
   him.]

     LAM
     You're late.

     LANDRY
     I got away as soon as I could.

     KIM LAM
     You're here. And that's what counts.

   [Landry turns to find Kim standing behind him, smiling. Landry returns
   the smile as he gazes appreciatively at his ex-wife. He gestures to her
   chair.]

     LANDRY
     Please.

   [Lam watches as Landry chivalrously pulls Kim's chair out.]

     LANDRY
     Thank you for coming.

     KIM LAM
     Thank you for inviting me.

   [Landry takes a seat across from Kim Lam.]

     LANDRY
     Carolyn.

     LAM
     Dad.

     KIM LAM
     We...have a lot to talk about.

     LANDRY
     We do, Kim.

   EXT--CLIFF, UNNAMED PLANET, DAY

   [Jacek's tel'tak is parked at the edge of a large canyon.]

   INT--TEL'TAK

   [Jacek is in the forward section of the ship while a trader looks
   inside the crates in the cargo hold. Jacek approaches.]

     JACEK
     Well, you've had long enough to look over the merchandise. What are
     you offering for this cargo ship full of weapons grade naquadah?

     TRADER
     You mean a cargo ship full of lead bars and...and these things.

   [The trader holds up one of the foam packaging curls filling the crate
   amongst lead bars. Jacek looks startled, but recovers quickly.]

     JACEK
     Oooh! This is a surprise. They've included the Jibbaran virility
     enhancers. Well! That's a bonus. Go ahead. Try a sample.

   [The trader dubiously eats one.]

     JACEK
     I understand they're very powerful. Can you feel it working?

   [Jacek peers at him closely. The trader continues chewing, an
   expression of wonder coming over his face.]

     TRADER
     Yes. I can.

     JACEK
     Let's talk deal. I may keep a couple of these for myself. Better to
     have them and not need them then to need them and not have them,
     right?

   [Jacek pockets a few of the packaging pieces and starts laughing. The
   trader laughs too.]

     JACEK
     We talk the same language, right?

   EXT--CLIFF, UNNAMED PLANET, DAY

   [The trader and Jacek's laughter can be heard outside the ship.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT

   INT--VALA'S QUARTERS

   [Several letters are on the bed. By the nightstand, Vala fingers the
   necklace Jacek gave her and walks around her bed. She stretches under
   her bed and pulls out a small rosewood style jewelry case. She opens
   the case and places the necklace amongst several other shiny baubles
   and cheap crystal trinkets.]

   [There is a knock at the door.]

     VALA
     Just a minute!

   [She hides the box and papers under the bed.]

     VALA
     Come in!

   [She stands up next to the bed. Carter enters, carrying a bottle of
   white wine and two glasses.]

     CARTER
     Hi!

     VALA
     Hi. What's this?

     CARTER
     Girls' night in.

     VALA
     Nice.

   [Vala sits on the bed as Carter perches on the footboard and places the
   glasses there. She opens the wine bottle and begins to pour.]

     CARTER
     So, how are you doing?

     VALA
     Great. Yeah, wonderful. Everything went according to plan. We led
     Jacek to the decoy ship while you secured the real one. He scammed
     us, but we scammed him better.

   [Carter gives her a sympathetic look. They toast their glasses and sip
   the wine.]

     VALA
     Cheers. So where are the boys tonight?

     CARTER
     Uh, Cameron has a date, Daniel's exhausted, and Teal'c got tickets
     to some show.

     VALA
     Hmm.

   INT--DARKENED THEATER, COLORADO SPRINGS

   [Teal'c, wearing a suit and stocking cap to cover his emblem, takes a
   seat in the darkened theater just before the curtain rises.]

     ACTRESS
     My girlfriends and I talk about a lot of things. There's just one
     topic we rarely discuss. Vaginas. And I asked myself, why is that?
     Why don't we talk about vaginas? Why are work and kids and holiday
     plans more acceptable topics of conversation than our own vaginas?
     And I didn't have an answer. So, I took it upon myself to find out.
     I started to talk about vaginas at work, at home, sometimes even in
     fancy restaurants! Soon my friends started to talk about vaginas as
     well. And it was only a matter of time before it became a hot
     conversation topic. No matter where I went, it was "vagina this",
     "vagina that," "vagina, vagina, vagina..."

   [As the actress speaks, Teal'c's eyes widen slightly and he looks at
   the middle aged woman beside him with a panicked smile, who smiles and
   nods before turning back to the stage. He turns to other side of him
   and finds the young woman with spiked hair and a nose ring who gives a
   challenging nod. Teal'c tries to sink into his chair in the female
   filled audience, covering his face in his hands in embarrassment.]
