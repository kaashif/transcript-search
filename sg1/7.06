   EXT CRASHED SPACESHIP DOMINATING DESERT LANDSCAPE

   [We open on a rock-strewn desert landscape, dominated by a vast
   spaceship, lodged against an outcropping of rock.]

   INT CRASHED SPACESHIP (STROMOS)

   [SG-1 climb down some steps into a compartment which appears to be
   inside the ship. It is very dark and filled with pods of some kind,
   lined up in a row in the background.]

     CARTER
     Sir, it's possible the beacon we detected with the MALP was
     activated remotely upon impact. If there's anyone left in those
     forward sections, I doubt that they could have survived, Sir.

     DANIEL
     There should be an indication somewhere about how long ago they
     crashed.

   [The team walks down in to a room at the bottom of the stairs, people
   are up against the wall in what seems to be some sort of containment
   device.]

     CARTER
     Sir, these people are alive! At least they're in some form of
     cryogenic sleep. Any civilisation without faster then light
     technology would have to resort to something like this in order to
     cross the vast distances between stars. Otherwise it would take them
     an entire generation or more. And given the effects of relativity...

     O'NEILL

     (cutting her off sharply)
     We've got a shipload of frozen people.

     CARTER

     (pissed)
     That would be the more succinct way of putting it, yes, Sir.

     TEAL'C
     Their current state probably protected them from the impact.

   [Daniel walks over to shine his flashlight down an immensely long
   compartment, filled with more of the cryogenic sleeping chambers.]

     DANIEL
     How many of them do you think there are?

     TEAL'C
     From the configuration of the ship's exterior, I would say four
     compartments of varying size.

     O'NEILL
     All right. We'll do a quick head count and see what we're dealing
     with, then we'll call for support.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, Teal'c, you two pair up. Daniel and I will start in this
     compartment.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

   [Carter and Teal'c climb back up the ladder while Daniel and O'Neill
   begin to walk down the compartment ahead of them. We cut to each team
   member as they search the ship, counting chambers O'Neill comes in to
   view, looking in to each person cryogenic device and counting as he
   goes.]

     O'NEILL
     105, 106.

   [He refocuses his flashlight beam on a chamber and sees a skeleton, its
   mouth agape.]

     O'NEILL
     105.

   [Not far from O'Neill, Daniel hears a strange screeching sound and
   looks around, his eyes widening in alarm.]

     DANIEL
     Jack!

   [A ball of light tears through the compartment, knocking out O'Neill.
   We see him fall, then cut to Carter and then Teal'c. Daniel is face
   down on the floor. O'Neill is unconscious too.]

   END TEASER

   ROLL CREDITS

   INT CRASHED SPACESHIP (STROMOS)

   [Teal'c regains consciousness, getting to his feet with difficulty,
   then reaching for his radio.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill? Major Carter? DanielJackson? Respond!

   [When there is no response to his hail, Teal'c draws his zat, then runs
   through the compartment to search out his teammates.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill?

   [Teal'c checks O'Neill's pulse, then, sure he is alive, continues his
   search. He finds Carter next.]

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter?

   [He checks her pulse and she too is alive.]

   [Teal'c moves off again, finding Daniel Jackson leaning against one of
   the cryogenic chambers.]

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson?

   [Awakening slowly, Daniel turns groggily to face Teal'c. He opens his
   eyes, his face contorting with fear as he screams hysterically.]

   INT SGC CONTROL ROOM

     TECHNICIAN DAVIS
     It's SG-4's IDC, Sir. They've got SG-1.

     HAMMOND
     Defence and medical teams, stand by. Open the iris.

   [SG4 walk through the Gate, carrying O'Neill and Carter in on
   stretchers, Dr. Fraiser rushes up to them.]

     FRAISER
     What've we got?

     SG4 AIRMAN
     They're both unconscious, vital signs are otherwise stable.

     FRAISER
     All right, get them to the infirmary and maintain security
     protocols.

     SG-4 AIRMAN
     Yes, ma'am.

   [Teal'c follows SG-1 through the Stargate, cradling Daniel
   protectively.]

     FRAISER

     Daniel?
     (startled by the terror he's exhibiting)

     DANIEL
     I've got to go back...I've got to go back...I have to go back...I
     have to go back!

   [Daniel breaks free of Teal'c and makes a break back for the Stargate,
   it dissipates moments before he reaches it.]

     DANIEL
     No. No!

     FRAISER
     Daniel!

     DANIEL
     No!

   [Daniel falls to the ground, moving his hands up in the air as if he is
   terrified, Fraiser moves down closer to him.]

     FRAISER
     Daniel, it's okay. Don't be afraid. Sergeant!

   [Fraiser's med techs dash up the ramp.]

   [Daniel's fingers twist in Fraiser's comforting ones as he looks around
   him in terror.]

     DANIEL
     Who are you? What is this place?

   [Cut to Fraiser, Hammond and Teal'c reacting in shock to this.]

   INT INFIRMARY

   [Carter and O'Neill are unconcious, their vital signs monitored. A
   nurse is caring for them while Hammond looks on in concern.]

     HAMMOND
     Notify me the moment they regain consciousness.

     NURSE
     Yes, Sir.

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Hammond joins Teal'c in the medical isolation observation room. Below,
   Fraiser and two med techs are confronted by Daniel Jackson, in white
   hospital pyjamas and leather restraints binding his wrists to his
   waist. Daniel is seething and impatient, filled with haughty arrogance,
   expecting instant obedience.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     Who is responsible for this? I demand to know why this has happened!
     (turns to face Fraiser)
     Why am I a prisoner?

     FRAISER

     (re the restraints)
     Those may be removed when you decide to calm down.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Calm? How do you expect me to be calm? I was made promised that
     nothing like this could happen! That nothing could go wrong!

     FRAISER
     Okay, let's start there. Can you tell me what has gone wrong?

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     What has gone wrong? What has gone wrong? What has gone wrong? Well,
     for a start you are not a member of my staff and that!

   [Daniel/Martice turns and points at his reflection in the mirror.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Is not me!

     FRAISER
     All right, listen carefully. We did not do this. In fact we're in
     the dark about what has happened as much as you apparently are. Now
     if you cooperate.

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     (coldly)
     I will undergo no more of your tests.

   [Daniel/Martice holds his forehead with one hand and whimpers]

     FRAISER
     Are you in pain?

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Yes! Yes. A great deal.

     FRAISER

     All right. I'll get something, but in the meantime try to stay calm
     or you'll be restrained further.<br\>
     (She turns to walk out of the room.)

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     You have no idea who I am, do you?

   [Fraiser hesitates, then leaves the room.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Teal'c and Hammond watch Fraiser leaving.]

     TEAL'C
     That is not Daniel Jackson.

     HAMMOND
     But is he a Goa'uld?

   [Fraiser joins Hammond and Teal'c in the observation room.]

     FRAISER
     No, Sir, but at the moment he's every bit as arrogant.

     HAMMOND
     Then is Dr. Jackson suffering from some sort of mental illness?

     FRAISER
     I honestly don't know yet, Sir. His preliminary ECG readings are
     like nothing I've ever seen. On one hand, there's indication of
     coma, but at the same time, we're seeing readings like those of a
     dozen people all jumbled together.

     HAMMOND
     Is his condition life threatening?

     FRAISER
     Couldn't even guess.

     TEAL'C
     He is claiming to be a passenger from the crashed alien vessel we
     discovered on the planet.

     HAMMOND
     How is that possible?

     FRAISER
     I have no idea, Sir, but Teal'c is right, and I think that we're
     dealing with more then one passenger. By that, I mean that Daniel's
     behaviour in the Gate room and throughout the preliminary testing
     was distinctly different than his current behaviour. I'd say that
     we've witnessed two, maybe even three seperate personalities.

     HAMMOND
     Could there be more?

     TEAL'C
     We discovered several hundred passengers in cryogenic suspension.

   [Teal'c breaks off as Daniel/Martice hurls a container of liquid at the
   two-way mirror which disguises the observation room. He confronts the
   med techs angrily and is restrained by them, lifted onto the bed and
   his arms held.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill had requested an enumeration of the cryogenic
     chambers. While we were separated, I lost consciousness momentarily.
     For what reason, I am unsure. When I returned, I found
     DanielJackson, Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter in their current
     states.

     FRAISER
     Speaking of which, Sir, I'd like to check in on the Colonel and Sam.

     HAMMOND
     Keep me apprised.

     FRAISER
     Yes, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Teal'c, maybe you should head down to the infirmary yourself.

     TEAL'C

     (implacable)
     I intend to remain here.

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     I'm ordinarily a very rational man.

     MED TECH
     Of course you are, Dr. Jackson.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     I am a Sovereign of Talthus. My name is Martice.

     MED TECH
     Beg your pardon, Sir.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Oh, Sir. Well, that's a start.

   [Daniel/Martice takes the glass of water and pill offered by the med
   techs and takes his pain medication.]

   INT INFIRMARY

   [Back in the medical room, Fraiser is checking Carter's
   responsiveness.]

     FRAISER
     The pupils are still a little dilated. It's as though they were
     struck with some sort of powerful zat weapon. Well, at least their
     EEG's are still normal.

     O'NEILL
     Oy!

     NURSE
     Doctor!

   [O'Neill slowly opens his eyes and tries to sit up, before falling back
   down on to the bed in great pain.]

     FRAISER
     Inform General Hammond that the Colonel is awake.

     NURSE
     Yes, Ma'am.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, Doc.

     FRAISER
     How are you feeling, Sir?

     O'NEILL
     Headache. Bad.

     FRAISER
     Well, I can take care of that, but first I need to know if you're
     feeling...yourself?

     O'NEILL
     Other then this nail through my head, fine. Why?

     FRAISER
     I'll explain later. Teal'c managed to get the three of you back
     through the Stargate from the ship, my team took it from there.

     O'NEILL
     Carter and Daniel?

     FRAISER
     Major Carter is suffering the same after-effects as you, Sir.

     CARTER
     Janet?

     FRAISER
     Sam?

   [Fraiser turns and walks over to Carter, who is very disoriented.]

     FRAISER
     Hey. It's gonna be fine. You've both suffered some form of neural
     shock.

   [Hammond walks in to the medical room.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, Major? How are you feeling?

     O'NEILL
     Got a nail in my head, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     That sounds like our Colonel O'Neill.

     FRAISER
     Their EEG's show normal brain activity, Sir. They appear to be
     unaffected.

     O'NEILL
     Unaffected? By what? Where's Daniel?

   [O'Neill tries to sit up, Fraiser tries to stop him.]

     FRAISER
     Sir, I need you to stay right where you are, at least until you're
     strong enough.

     O'NEILL
     I'm fine!

     FRAISER
     No, you're not, Sir!

     O'NEILL
     Oww.

   [O'Neill falls back down on to the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     No, I'm not.

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

   [Back in the isolation room, Daniel can be seen sitting on the bed
   holding his head in his hands]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Just find the small woman and tell her what she gave me wasn't good
     enough. It isn't working!

   [The medical technician ignores him.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     Do you speak?
     (he pulls a face)

   [Fraiser enters the isolation room.]

     FRAISER
     How are you feeling now?

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Your medicine is worthless.

     FRAISER
     You still in pain?

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     This body must be damaged.

     FRAISER
     I doubt that. Dr. Jackson was in perfect health.

   [She walks over to the table and begins to make a notation in the
   medical file.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     I assume Dr. Jackson was the former...
     (he looks down)
     ...Not that I have anything against it mind you. It's younger and
     stronger than my own.

   [Daniel/Martice admires himself in the mirror, stretching
   appreciatively.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Did something happen to my own body? In times of disaster people
     need their Sovereign to look up to. How will they recognise me now?

     FRAISER
     I've already told you we didn't do this.

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     (yelling)
     How else could I have arrived in this situation!

     FRAISER
     We don't know.

   [Daniel/Martice suddenly stands up suddenly and looms deliberately over
   Fraiser, who backs up from him, alarmed, her med techs moving forward
   protectively.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     (sneering)
     How useful you are.
     (he prowls away from Fraiser)
     What is this place?

     FRAISER
     One of our medical isolation rooms.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Could you be less specific?

     FRAISER
     In a military facility, on a planet called Earth.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Earth? The ship was bound for Ardena. How far are we from Ardena?

     FRAISER
     I don't know.

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     The other passengers, they will be concernd for me.
     (afterthought)
     As I am for them, of course.

     FRAISER
     Most of them are still onboard the ship, but we think it's possible
     that several of them may be here with us right now.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     As prisoners?

     FRAISER
     No, we think they may be right here in this room. We don't know the
     reason, but somehow several of the passengers who were in cryogenic
     sleep have...

   [Daniel lowers his head, once more in intense pain.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     What's happening?

   [The medical technicians slowly move forwards towards Daniel.]

     FRAISER
     Martice?

     DANIEL/TRYAN

     (gasping, pained)
     No. No, Martice is the Sovereign. I'm...I'm just a crew member.

   [He catches sight of his face in the mirror and freezes in shock.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Is that?

   [He walks over to the mirror and examines himself, pulling at his skin,
   his lips, holding his face, appalled.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     How can this be?

     FRAISER
     It's all right, I'm here to help you.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     No, no, this is wrong! This is a mistake!

     FRAISER
     Yes, it is, one that we want to correct. I'm Dr. Fraiser.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     I am Tryan, engineer, second rank.

     FRAISER
     All right, Tryan. Why don't we start again?

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Again?

   CUT TO TEAL'C gravely watching Fraiser talking with Daniel/Tryan in the
   room below

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     I don't recognise this man. Or rather myself.

     FRAISER
     His name is Daniel Jackson. The body you're inhabiting belongs to
     him.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     He wasn't onboard the Stromos.

     FRAISER
     No.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Then how could I have ended up in his body?

     FRAISER
     Your ship crashed on a planet that we call P2A-347. We don't know
     how or why the crash occured, only that the only survivors were
     those in cryogenic sleep. When Daniel Jackson and the other members
     of his team boarded your ship, this happened.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     I have no memory of coming here.

     FRAISER
     What do you remember?

   FLASHBACK TRYAN'S SPACESHIP

   [The scene flashes back to Tryan's spaceship, the Stromos. The
   compartments are heaving with activity, the people tense and rushed.]

     PHARRIN
     Tryan?

     TRYAN
     Compartment is secure, Sir.

     PHARRIN
     Very well.

   [Tryan walks over to an empty compartment, enters and activates it, the
   canopy closing over him.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Leaving Talthus, entering my sleep chamber, and seeing your face
     here.

   [Daniel/Tryan looks at the restraints in place on him.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Why am I restrained?

     FRAISER
     It wasn't you. You're the fourth personality to emerge since being
     brought back. We believe that there are others from your ship, in
     there along with you.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     In one body?

     FRAISER
     Plus Dr. Jackson.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     No. The strain on the body would be too great. It wouldn't survive.

     FRAISER
     Do you know that for certain?

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     It couldn't happen. The only conceivable result would be insanity.

     FRAISER
     Then we should both hope you're wrong.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Dr. Frasier, you don't appreciate that what's happened is
     technically impossible. This can't happen. One cannot return to any
     other body than one's own, there are failsafes to prevent exactly
     that from happening.

     FRAISER
     Tryan. It has happened. All you need to do is look in the mirror to
     prove it to yourself.

   [Tryan looks towards the mirror.]

     FRAISER
     Now, we don't have a lot of time, and you're the first personality
     to emerge so far that's been helpful, so I need you to think, all
     right? How could this happen?

   [Daniel/Tryan rubs his forehead as he closes his eyes and thinks hard.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     A cryo-sleeper's consciousness is stored in the same memory module
     that maintains the sleeper's body. There is simply no way to
     seperate them or send the consciousness to any other than its
     corresponding body. Unless...Oh, no! Unless the sleepers' bodies are
     dead.

   [Fraiser is shocked.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Hammond, O'Neill and Carter join Teal'c in the observation room.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, Major Carter. I am pleased to see you have recovered.

     CARTER
     How is he?

     TEAL'C
     Yet another personality has emerged. Dr. Fraiser appears to be
     making progress.

     O'NEILL
     How'd he get stuck in here?

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson's preliminary electroencephalogram proved anomalous.

     O'NEILL
     I dare you to say that again.

   [Teal'c looks up at O'Neill, O'Neill looks down challengingly. Teal'c
   calmly accepts, opening his mouth...]

     HAMMOND
     Dr. Frasier declared a Code 17. Dr. Jackson has been under constant
     guard, and only she and a few of her staff have had any direct
     contact, as a precautionary measure.

     CARTER

     (shocked)
     She thought he was a Goa'uld?

     HAMMOND
     We've since ruled that out, but I'm not taking any chances until we
     can determine the means by which these additional persons have found
     their way into Dr. Jackson.

     CARTER
     To do that, I'd have to have another look at their cryogenic
     systems.

     HAMMOND
     Schedule a mission briefing with Dr. Frasier as soon as possible.

     O'NEILL

     (O'Neill's deep concern for Daniel sounds in his quiet voice)
     With your permission, Sir, I'd like to stick it out here with
     Daniel.

     HAMMOND
     You realise that only medical personnel are allowed access?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

   [Hammond, Carter and Teal'c leave a sombre O'Neill behind to watch over
   Daniel.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

     FRAISER
     All right, Tryan, look, let's not jump to conclusions here.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     I'm sorry. There's simply no other way this could've happened. Only
     then can the failsafes be overidden and the consciousness purged
     from the system I am dead. As are the others who may reside in this
     body.

     FRAISER
     You can't be sure of that until we go back to the planet.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Well, you will see.

     FRAISER
     Okay, look, just help me out with something here. Why do you
     seperate the consciousness from the body in the cryo-sleep process?

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     A consciousness cannot survive the restoration process without a
     significant loss of memory and intellect. A person undertaking such
     a long journey without proper storage of their consciousness would
     arrive at their destination as a mere fraction of themselves. The
     very essence of that person would be lost.

     FRAISER
     So the memory requirement must be enormous.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Each cryogenic capsule contains an active matrix memory module
     sufficient to sustain one single mind. Its systems are connected
     with those that regulate and sustain the corresponding sleeper's
     body.

     FRAISER
     Well, it may be possible to upload your consciousness back into that
     memory.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     No, each module can store only one consciousness.

     FRAISER
     Then do it one at a time.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     No, that's not possible. Here.

   [He walks around to the end of the bed and picks up a glass of water,
   studies it.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Could these same water molecules ever be returned to this glass just
     as they were before, no more, no less, in precisely the same
     configuration?

   [Daniel/Tryan slowly pours the water from the glass back into the jug
   of water. Fraiser closes her eyes in pained realisation.]

     FRAISER
     No.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Our minds have been blended together, poured into one vessel
     ill-equipped to sustain our volume.

   [Fraiser suddenly moves forward closer to Daniel/Tryan.]

     FRAISER
     But if the computers onboard your ship can separate the human
     consciousness from the body, then surely they can isolate the?

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Can you hear that?

     FRAISER
     No, I can't hear anything.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     The others. Their voices. I can hear them. They're getting louder.

     FRAISER
     Tryan, look, I need you to stay with me, all right? We need to work
     together on this.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     It's a most incredible feeling.

     FRAISER
     I doubt the others can help as much as you can.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     No one can help.

   [Daniel/Tryan closes his eyes and drops his head.]

     FRAISER
     Don't say that!

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     They're pulling at me now. I don't know how long...

   [He whimpers in great pain.]

     Daniel suddenly opens his eyes and stares around the room in shock.

     DANIEL
     Janet?

     FRAISER

     Daniel?
     (her face and voice change, she knows it's him)

     DANIEL
     What's going on?

     FRAISER
     Look, something has happened, I need you to just stay with me okay?
     Just hang in there.

   INT BRIEFING ROOM

   [We pull back from Daniel's face to an image of him, suffering, on a
   monitor in the briefing room.]

     FRAISER
     That was it. A moment later another person emerged, but we didn't
     learn anything from her. So, he only surfaced for a moment, but it
     was definitely Daniel.

     CARTER
     At least we know he's still in there.

     FRAISER
     Mmm-hmm. Dr. MacKenzie just did a detailed analysis of his EEG and
     MRI readings. We think that Daniel himself is in a sort of coma,
     having being supressed by the others. It's as though his own
     consciousness has retreated, protecting itself. That's why he could
     only surface for such a short time. The other signals are a jumbled
     mess.

     HAMMOND
     How many others are there?

     FRAISER
     It's only a guess, but Dr. Mackenzie believes that Daniel could be
     carrying the minds of as many as a dozen of the ship's passengers.

     CARTER
     Sir, it's possible that I could reconfigure the ship's systems to
     separate Daniel.

     HAMMOND
     The last time you were on that ship, you were attacked.

     CARTER
     It may have been automated defences.

     TEAL'C
     I think not, Major Carter. I discovered DanielJackson at the base of
     one of the sleep chambers. The door was open.

     CARTER
     There's no way Daniel would've stepped into one of those things on
     his own.

     TEAL'C
     Then someone else must have done so. Perhaps I regained
     consciousness before DanielJackson's assailant was able to do the
     same to us?

     CARTER
     The question is why.

     FRAISER
     Tryan seemed absolutely sure that his physical body was dead.

     HAMMOND
     So?

     FRAISER
     So, what if this was a desperate attempt to preserve these people?.
     What if the person who attacked you is simply trying to keep these
     people alive in the only way he could?

     TEAL'C
     The ship could not have sustained them indefinitely.

     CARTER
     So Daniel's a--a lifeboat?

     FRAISER
     Yeah, it's possible.

     CARTER
     Sir, I recommend that SG-12 accompany us back to the planet. They
     can search the ship for whoever did this while I study the cryogenic
     systems.

     HAMMOND
     You have a go. Dismissed!

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

   [O'Neill watches from the observation room as Fraiser talks to the
   latest personality to emerge in Daniel.]

     FRAISER

     I don't think we've had a chance to meet.
     (she speaks gently, her voice very warm and soothing)

     DANIEL/KEENIN

     Where's my father?
     (Keenin is a very young child)

     FRAISER
     I'm sorry, I--I don't know. Do you mind if I sit down beside you?

   [Daniel/Keenin nods his head slowly.]

     FRAISER
     Okay.

   [Fraiser walks slowly over to him, respecting his fear and uncertainty,
   and sits beside him.]

     DANIEL/KEENIN

     (looks sidelong at the med techs and whispers)
     What about them?

     FRAISER
     Oh, no, they won't hurt you.

     FRAISER
     Tell you what? Why don't I tell you everything I know and then we'll
     just take it from there, okay? What's your name?

     DANIEL/KEENIN

     Keenin.
     (his voice is soft and hesitant)

     FRAISER
     Keenin? That's a very nice name. I'm Dr. Fraiser.

   INT GATE ROOM

     HAMMOND
     SG-12? Move out.

   [SG-12 move up the ramp and walk through the Stargate.]

     HAMMOND

     (addressing Carter and Teal'c)
     I know that you'll do anything to save Dr. Jackson, but the last
     thing we need is for this to happen to both of you.

     CARTER
     We have every intention of avoiding that, Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Good luck.

   [Carter and Teal'c stride up the ramp.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

     FRAISER
     Keenin, we're trying to figure out everything we can about how this
     happened. What's the last thing you remember?

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     My father.

   FLASHBACK--STROMOS, THE PAST

   [Daniel/Keenin remembers standing in one of the sleeping chambers, his
   father kneeling before him. He's a very small boy, pale and sad, blonde
   and with huge brown eyes. His expression is the same as that on
   Daniel's face.]

     KEENIN
     Why can't I wait with you?

     PHARRIN
     The ship must accelerate to escape the flare's radiation. You'll be
     safer here. You will dream sweet dreams, and when you awaken, we'll
     be in orbit around Ardena and I will be right here.

     KEENIN
     Talthus will be gone.

     PHARRIN
     Hundreds of years will have passed, Keenin, and all of this hardship
     will be part of our distant history. Do you understand?

   [Keenin slowly nods and his father kisses him on the cheek.]

     PHARRIN
     Now close your eyes.

   [Keenin closes his eyes...]

   FLASHBACK ENDS; BACK TO PRESENT

   [...and Daniel's eyes open in the medical isolation room.]

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     I didn't want to go. I wanted to stay on Talthus.

     FRAISER
     So you had to leave?

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     They knew it was going to happen since a long time before I was
     born. Do you know what a dark star is?

     FRAISER
     Mm-hmm. One that's burned out its fuel.

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     They said it would pass close enough to our sun to make it flare and
     that it would engulf Talthus. I knew my whole life that the world
     was gonna end.

   CUT TO O'NEILL reacting sorrowfully to Keenin's pain

     FRAISER
     So your people built the Stromos?

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     They built three ships, including the Stromos, but it wasn't enough.
     They had a lottery. They said that was the only fair way. But my
     father was an officer on the Stromos. He was allowed to pick one
     person from his family. And m-m-my mother made him choose me.

   [Tears slowly start to form in Daniel/Keenin's eyes.]

     FRAISER
     It's all right.

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     My mother said that she would take her chance with the lottery, but
     she wasn't chosen. The Sovereigns were chosen, but she wasn't
     chosen. No one I know was chosen. I wanted to stay with her.

   [Weeping for his loss, he lays his head in Fraiser's lap and she
   strokes his hair, soothing him.]

     FRAISER
     It's okay. Ssshhh. It's all right. It's all right. Ssshhh. It's
     okay.

   [O'Neill watches painfully from the observation room as Fraiser
   comforts the little boy in Daniel's body. The hand on Fraiser's labcoat
   clenches.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     What are you doing...?

   [Fraiser freezes, taken by surprise, taking a moment to adjust from
   comforting Keenin to the arrogance of Martice.]

     FRAISER
     Martice?

   [Fraiser jumps up and moves away, gasping a little.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     You may address me as Sovereign and I will ask you never to do that
     again. Now, what have you done to resolve this?

   INT STROMOS

   [Aboard the Stromos, Carter and Teal'c move slowly through a dark
   compartment.]

     CARTER

     (on her radio)
     SG-12? This is Carter, come in?

     SG-12 AIRMAN
     This is SG-12. We've just begun our search.

     CARTER
     Okay, stay in radio contact, Carter out.

     CARTER

     (To Teal'c)
     These power levels readings are extremely low. I don't know how it
     could still be working.

     TEAL'C

     (of the sleepers)
     Perhaps if we revive one of them, they may be of some assistance.

     CARTER
     I don't think there's even enough power to do that.

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

   [Back in the isolation room, FRAISER and DANIEL/Sovereign are still
   talking, O'NEILL is staring into the room.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     I demand to speak to someone with authority.

     FRAISER
     Well, I'm sorry. You're stuck with me.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Why have you involved the boy in this?

     FRAISER
     What boy?

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     The boy, you were just talking to him. Where is he?

   INT STROMOS

     CARTER
     If we don't get these systems hooked up to another power source
     soon, then these people are going to die. I'll need a naquadah
     generator and I'll have to build.

   [Teal'c suddenly raises his hand to silence her, listening alertly. We
   hear muffled footsteps.]

     CARTER
     One generation should be enough.

   [Teal'c moves silently over to the doorway and grabs a man by the
   throat as he enters their compartment. Carter raises her gun and shines
   her flashlight beam on the man's face. It's Keenin's father.]

     PHARRIN
     Please. Don't hurt us.

   [Pharrin is frightened and traumatised, his face and eyes red from
   crying. He is no real threat. Carter lowers her gun.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

   [Back in the isolation room, Daniel/Martice is pacing the room,
   clutching at his head, his distress very evident. His voice is without
   its usual arrogance and aggression. There is no doubt he is suffering
   greatly.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Tell them to stop shouting. It is unbearable!

     FRAISER
     I can't hear them.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Be silent!

     FRAISER
     They're in your mind, Martice.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     No, no, no, no! What you're saying cannot be so. I have
     responsibilities to attend to, I--I cannot remain here.

     FRAISER
     You cannot leave!

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     A thousand of our people depend on me to lead them, I am the
     Sovereign. They have sworn an oath to me!

     FRAISER
     I'm sorry.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     It is my destiny to rule over Ardena.

     FRAISER
     Listen, you don't understand the seriousness of your condition.

     DANIEL

     (he darts forward, raising his hand aggressively at Fraiser)
     And you still do not realise who you are talking to!
     (raging)

     FRAISER

     (angry)
     I don't give a damn! You don't belong in that man's body and I
     intend to take it back!
     (threatening)

   INT STROMOS

   [Back onboard the Stromos, TEAL'C and CARTER are talking to the PHARRIN
   who they found earlier.]

     TEAL'C
     Are there other conscious people onboard this ship?

     PHARRIN
     No, the others still sleep. Why have you come back?

     CARTER
     You've done something to one of our people.

     PHARRIN
     Is he here with you?

     TEAL'C
     He is not.

     CARTER
     Are you the one responsible?

     PHARRIN
     There was no choice. No other way. You must do the same.

     CARTER
     I don't think so.

     PHARRIN
     The ship's power is failing.. It is the only way we can save them.
     Pharrin figured out a way to override the failsafes. It can be done.
     Don't you see? These souls are the last of an entire world. They
     cannot be allowed to end like this.

     CARTER
     Maybe there's another way?

     PHARRIN
     No. No, the power is fading even now in every compartment. If the
     two of you carry but a handful of souls, we can route the remaining
     power back to the others.

     CARTER
     That's not going to happen.

     PHARRIN
     We do not know how many more we can accommodate.

     CARTER
     We?

     TEAL'C
     I believe he, like DanielJackson, carries the consciousnesses of
     many.

     PHARRIN
     Thirteen souls now reside in Pharrin's body. I fear, I can harbour
     no more.

     TEAL'C
     To what end do you attempt to preserve the life of these people?
     Their bodies are dead.

     PHARRIN
     We are the last of an entire world! The other ships will come. We
     have sent a message, they will hear it and they will come. And when
     they do, they will find a way to restore us.

     TEAL'C
     Why did you not attempt to revive the others?

   FLASHBACK

   [The scene flashes back to when the Stromos crashed.]

     PHARRIN
     After the ship crashed? We still don't know why it happened. He was
     revived by the computer, but the power requirement of his
     restoration caused too great a drain on the rest of the compartment.
     Power levels were dropping. Pharrin had only minutes to restore
     power to twelve of the sleeper chambers before the occupants were
     dead. But there wasn't enough time. Pharrin was failing them, one by
     one. There was no other choice, no other way to preserve us.

   Returning to the present

     PHARRIN
     There are over a thousand souls aboard the Stromos! If Pharrin had
     attempted to revive the others, then many more may have died.

     CARTER
     Even one person to share the burden.

     PHARRIN
     Pharrin walked as far as he could see! There was little more then
     rock! Neither was there sufficient water or food remaining aboard
     after the crash. Pharrin dared not revive another soul.

   [Pharrin rubs at his face.]

     PHARRIN
     We are not alone. We live in a democracy of one. It is strange, yes,
     but we are the chosen survivors of an entire race. How could Pharrin
     have allowed even one of us to be lost?

     CARTER
     Still, we could've helped you.

     PHARRIN

     (Shakes his head from side to side, his voice changing each time as
     the personalities he carries conflict)
     We should have asked them! No! We could not take the chance.
     You--would never have consented, would you?

     TEAL'C
     We would not.

     PHARRIN

     Then, we chose correctly.
     (He flashes back to himself, hiding, as Teal'c kneels by the
     unconscious Daniel.)
     Our mistake was to flee after you revived so quickly from our stun
     weapon and returned for your friends. Too many of us were afraid.

     CARTER
     There are other ways that we can help.

     PHARRIN
     How?

     CARTER
     Well, for starters we could provide you with an alternate power
     source, one capable of bringing your energy reserves back up to
     where they need to be to revive your people. It's possible that I
     can retrieve it and have it up and running within a few hours.

     PHARRIN

     (he shakes his head again, the personalities fighting for control)
     Pharrin, there is no other way. Listen to her! No! We must wait! The
     ships will come!

     CARTER
     We can take you anywhere you want to go. Another world like Ardena.

     PHARRIN
     You have a ship?

     CARTER
     We know of a device capable of transporting all your people
     instantaneously to any number of worlds. We call it a Stargate.

     PHARRIN
     Such a device is not possible.

     CARTER
     Come back with us and I'll prove it to you.

     TEAL'C
     However, we will only consent to do so if you return our friend to
     his former state.

     PHARRIN
     He is preserving life.

     TEAL'C
     At the expense of his own! Against his will!

     PHARRIN
     Please. Do not ask us to do this.

     CARTER
     We're not asking.

     PHARRIN
     The souls that your friend carries within him are amongst the most
     precious of all.

     TEAL'C

     (furious)
     Our friend is equally as important to us.

     PHARRIN
     There will be nowhere for them to go. They will be lost.

     CARTER
     But it is possible to undo this?

   [Pharrin is shaking violently now, physically fighting himself for
   control.]

     PHARRIN
     How can I abandon them so easily! We have sworn to protect the
     Sovereign! But we may save hundreds of others!

     CARTER

     (yelling)
     Pharrin!

     PHARRIN

     There is a way.
     (pathetic)

     CARTER
     Do you understand that what we're offering could save everyone on
     this ship?

     PHARRIN
     And do you understand that one of the souls that your friend carries
     within him--is my son?

   [Carter's eyes widen in comprehension. She understands at last
   Pharrin's desperation and the stakes they are facing.]

   INT MEDICAL ISOLATION ROOM

   [Daniel leans heavily against the bed, panting harshly, in desperate
   straits.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Please, why does it hurt so much!

     FRAISER
     All right.

   [Fraiser turns to face the medical technician at the door.]

     FRAISER
     Prepare 100 micrograms of phentanol!

   [The technician nods and walks outside of the isolation room. As the
   technician leaves, Daniel suddenly stands up.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     That won't be necessary, Dr. Frasier. I seem to have a higher
     threshold for pain then the others.

     FRAISER
     Tryan?

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     Yes.

     FRAISER
     Oh, thank God for that!

   [The isolation room door opens and Carter walks in.]

     CARTER
     Janet? Can I have a word?

     FRAISER

     (To Tryan)
     I'll be back.

   [Carter and Fraiser leave the medical isolation room. In the
   observation room above, Hammond and Teal'c have joined O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     You sure you trust this guy?

     TEAL'C
     He has much to gain by assisting us.

   [Below them, Pharrin walks into the medical isolation room with Fraiser
   and Carter.]

     DANIEL/TRYAN

     Officer Pharrin, Sir! Engineer Tryan, second rank.
     (he bows)

     PHARRIN
     Tryan? Of course! Of all of our crew, you would've thought this was
     not possible.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     And of all of our crew, Sir, you're the one who'd find a way to do
     it. How did you manage?

     PHARRIN
     Our training and a shared will to survive. It is a strange way of
     living with others, but it is better than the alternative.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     What of our ship and our passengers, Sir?

   [Pharrin moves closer to Daniel/Tryan.]

     PHARRIN
     Our ship crash landed. We failed to reach Ardena. Her passengers may
     yet be saved, but not without considerable sacrifice, to you and to
     the others of the Stromos that reside within you.

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     I understand, Sir.

     PHARRIN
     These people possess a device capable of transporting all our people
     to another world, perhaps even Ardena. It is very real and it will
     save our people. But in exchange they ask that their friend be
     returned to them as he was before. I believe it can be done if we
     act quickly. It is a reasonable bargain.

     DANIEL/TRYAN

     (resolute)
     I will do whatever is necessary, Sir. Whatever you ask of me.

   [Daniel/Tryan nods assurance to Pharrin and Fraiser relaxes
   fractionally. Daniel/Tryan's head drops.]

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     (yelling)
     No! There will no sacrifice of any kind! Officer Pharrin, as your
     Sovereign I demand that you return me to the ship immediately!

   [Pharrin drops to his knees and bows reverently before his sovereign.]

     CARTER
     Pharrin!

     PHARRIN
     We have sworn an oath to do his will. We cannot proceed.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Officer Pharrin? I've given you a command. Do you understand me?

     O'NEILL

     (watching from the observation room)
     Oh, for crying out loud!

   [Furiously angry, he gets up and storms out of the observation room and
   down into the isolation room.]

     O'NEILL
     Get up!

     PHARRIN
     I've sworn to protect the Sovereign!

   [O'Neill yanks Pharrin to his feet.]

     O'NEILL
     Your Sovereign's dead!

     PHARRIN
     But his soul lives on!

     O'NEILL
     Not if I cut him out!

     PHARRIN
     You would not.

     O'NEILL

     Oh, yes, I would.
     (a promise)

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     Pharrin, you listen to me!

     O'NEILL

     Don't listen! You just do what you came here to do!
     (implacable)

   [Shaken, Pharrin stares intently at his sovereign, Daniel/Martice
   staring commandingly back at him.]

     PHARRIN
     Forgive us, Sovereign. It is the only way to protect our people.

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     I will not surrender this body, not at any cost! It is mine!

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     It was never ours to begin with!

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     If you save anyone, you will save me!

     DANIEL/TRYAN
     The people of Talthus will die!

     DANIEL/MARTICE

     (yelling)
     Let them!

   [Pharrin grabs hold of Daniel/Martice.]

     PHARRIN
     Forgive me, Sovereign!

     DANIEL/MARTICE
     How dare you touch me!

     PHARRIN
     For twelve years, we have fought to save the people of Talthus, and
     we will do everything in our power to do so! No matter how great the
     sacrifice.

   [Daniel/Martice drops his head.]

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     Father?

     PHARRIN

     (he gasps)
     Keenin?
     (his voice is breaking)
     I am so sorry, my son. You must sacrifice as well, and we will be
     together. Do you understand?

   [Tears begin to gather in Pharrin's eyes as Daniel/Keenin nods his
   acceptance.]

     PHARRIN
     The people of Talthus will be safe. And they will remember us
     forever.

     DANIEL/KEENIN
     But we'll be together?

     PHARRIN

     We'll be together.
     (he is crying as he makes this promise)

   INT STROMOS

   [Back onboard the Stromos, Daniel and Pharrin are hooked up to the
   memory matrix module in two adjacent cryogenic chambers., O'Neill and
   Dr. Fraiser watching over them.]

     O'NEILL
     Well?

     FRAISER
     Well, there's no way to tell yet if they all made it into Pharrin,
     but Daniel's readings are back to normal.

     O'NEILL
     How'd you do that?

     FRAISER
     Wasn't me, Sir. It was Daniel. His consciousness protected itself
     and he never emerged for more then a few seconds. That's what
     allowed Pharrin to separate the others from Daniel and absorb them
     himself.

     O'NEILL
     The more the merrier, I guess.

     FRAISER
     He'll stay in suspended animation until the rest of the ships
     passengers can be revived and take care of him.

     O'NEILL
     You mean them?

   [Carter and Teal'c climb down the steps into the compartment as the
   power and lights come back up.]

     CARTER
     The naquadah generator will sustain the power, Sir.

     TEAL'C
     We should be able to begin the restoration process within hours.

     CARTER
     And we can start relocating them shortly after that.

     O'NEILL
     Good, we'll leave that for SG-4, they love that kind of stuff.

     CARTER
     How's Daniel?

     FRAISER
     He'll probably be unconscious for a while, I think it's best if we
     give him...

     DANIEL
     What?

   [Daniel struggles to open his eyes as Fraiser is speaking. O'Neill
   moves over to Daniel at once.]

     O'NEILL

     Daniel?
     (gently)
     That you?

     DANIEL
     Jack?

     O'NEILL
     How you doing?

     DANIEL
     Bad headache.

     O'NEILL
     Nail in the head kind of thing?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, something like that.

     O'NEILL

     Yeah.
     (he smiles)

   [Cut in turn to Carter, Fraiser and Teal'c smiling in relief that
   Daniel is safe. Daniel struggles to focus, staring around him
   uncomprehendingly and in pain.]

   FADE OUT
