   INT--MOTHERSHIP

   [Replicators swarm through the ship.]

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

     JACOB
     The Replicators. They've launched an all-out attack on the Goa'uld.
     If the Goa'uld can't find a way to stop them the Replicators will
     easily overrun our galaxy in a matter of weeks.

   INT--MOTHERSHIP

   [The Replicators zoom in on Daniel, who is suddenly beamed away.]

     CARTER
     Daniel!

   INT--REPLICATOR SHIP

   [Suddenly, bands come out of the wall, holding Daniel in place by his
   arms and legs.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Unfortunately, to get what I need, we're going to have to dig a
     little deeper.

   [More blocks extend from the wall around both sides of Daniel's head.]]

   INT--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

     TEAL'C
     We must, once and for all, destroy the Goa'uld's image as Gods,
     forever.

     BRA'TAC
     How?

     TEAL'C
     By capturing the temple at Dakara.

   [Bra'tac looks shocked.]

   INT--TENT

     DANIEL
     There's a way to defeat the Replicators hidden somewhere within my
     memories, isn't there?

     OMA
     You need only to open your mind to it.

   INT--ANUBIS' TEMPLE

     BA'AL
     A force of rebel Jaffa have managed to take control of the temple at
     Dakara.

     ANUBIS
     Have the fleet disengage their battle with the Replicators. Take it
     back at all cost.

   INT--TENT

   [The sand outside the tent is being re-formed to the shape of the
   temple at Dakara.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     The ruins of an Ancient monument on a planet now called Dakara.
     Within it is the one weapon in this galaxy capable of destroying me.

   [She moves her hand and the image in the sand blows away.]

   TEASER

   EXT--SGC COMPLEX DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER
     A device capable of destroying all life in the galaxy.

     O'NEILL
     That's what he said.

   [Carter, O'Neill and Jacob are sitting around the paper-strewn table.]

     JACOB
     Ba'al said he was serving Anubis?

     O'NEILL
     Not exactly. You know those Goa'uld and their egos.

   [O'Neill mimes a large head with his hands.]

     JACOB
     He would never admit to being subservient.

     O'NEILL
     No. He said he was biding his time, learning what he could from
     Anubis.

     JACOB
     Probably looking for a way to kill him.

     CARTER
     Well, we have no idea how this Ancient device works or what the
     effects will be, but since Anubis has no real corporeal form it's
     likely he would survive it.

     JACOB
     He'd have no-one left to rule.

     CARTER
     For now. Time may not even be an issue for someone like him. He
     could essentially start over, re-populate the galaxy to his own
     specifications.

     O'NEILL
     A little ambitious.

     CARTER
     Well, he has at least some knowledge of the Ancients. I wouldn't put
     it past him.

     O'NEILL
     Well, let me sit here and state the obvious. We can't let something
     like this get into his hands.

     JACOB
     Or the Replicator's hands, for that matter.

     CARTER
     How much time do we have before Ba'al's fleet reaches Dakara?

     O'NEILL
     Why?

     CARTER
     Ba'al didn't say exactly where the device was, did he?

     O'NEILL
     No, he said it was hidden.

     CARTER
     Well, chances are it's in the ruins but we can't be sure. Short of
     blowing up the entire planet we can't be 100 percent positive we've
     destroyed it. And if it's protected by a shield, even our biggest
     naquadah enhanced nuke might not do it.

     JACOB
     The fact is, to be sure we've destroyed the weapon, we have to find
     it first.

     O'NEILL
     Go.

   [O'Neill gestures with his hands. Carter and Jacob gather their files
   and nod at each other.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--DAKARA

   [A couple of ships fly over the ruins.]

   EXT--DAKARA TEMPLE

   [Teal'c leads Carter and Jacob to a wall. They are followed by a couple
   of soldiers carrying a large box.]

     TEAL'C
     We found no evidence of a weapon.

   [Teal'c stops at the wall which is covered in Ancient text.]

     CARTER

     (to soldiers)
     Thanks, guys, we'll take it from here.

   [The soldiers set down the box and turn to leave.]

     JACOB
     This structure was definitely built by the Ancients.

     TEAL'C
     As evidenced by the script on this wall. Until I saw this monument
     with my own eyes, I did not know that Dakara was a home of the
     Ancients.

     CARTER
     The Ancient repository of knowledge we found on P3X-439 was hidden
     in a large monument like this.

     JACOB
     Maybe this writing will help us uncover the location of the weapon.

     TEAL'C
     I was able to recognise the language. Deciphering it, however, is
     another matter.

     CARTER
     I brought Daniel's notebooks.

   [Jacob lowers his head for Selmak to appear.]

     SELMAK
     This dialect looks very old. It may take some time.

     TEAL'C
     I will leave you to it.

   [Teal'c and Selmak nod at each other, then Teal'c leaves. Carter begins
   to unpack a backpack.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A number of rebel ships are in orbit.]

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     ARON
     We will be vastly outnumbered by Ba'al's forces.

     TOLOK
     I refuse to consider a strategy that demands the deliberate
     sacrifice of Jaffa lives.

     ARON
     What then do you advocate? Prayer perhaps?

   [Teal'c enters the room.]

     BRA'TAC
     Jaffa. We are here to consider the battle with our enemy.

   [Teal'c walks up to stand next to Bra'tac. He glares at the assembled
   group of Jaffa.]

     TEAL'C
     Not battle each other.

   (to Bra'tac) Ba'al's forces approach at a rate of speed, far slower
   than they are capable.

     BRA'TAC
     Indeed. It seems he does wish to give us time to find and destroy
     the weapon.

     TOLOK
     Why not just destroy it himself?

     TEAL'C
     Ba'al is in a difficult position. With so many witnesses, it is far
     easier to tell Anubis that the weapon was destroyed before he was
     able to reclaim Dakara.

     ARON
     How then will he explain his languid pace?

     BRA'TAC
     Regardless, he will only hesitate so long.

     TOLOK
     Five Ha'tak. Eight Al-Kesh. Ten squadrons of gliders. That is all we
     have.

     TEAL'C
     Empty the bays. Deploy the gliders to the far side of the planet.
     Take two Ha'tak and all the Al-Kesh and position them on the other
     side of the moon.

     TOLOK
     Divide our forces?

     BRA'TAC
     Precisely!

     TEAL'C
     All of the hardship, the suffering, the sacrifices we have made for
     our cause will end today, one way or another. This battle will
     decide the fate of all Jaffa.

   [Tolok nods, smiling slightly.]

     ARON
     This is madness.

     TEAL'C
     So too, at one time, was the very thought of our freedom.

   INT--TENT

   [Daniel and Replicator Carter face each other.]

     DANIEL
     So now what? We done? You got what you wanted. Don't suppose you
     want to just drop me off at the nearest Stargate?

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     It is true, I learned the location of the weapon that could be a
     threat to me and my brethren, but I also saw the extent of knowledge
     your subconscious mind contains.

   [She walks nearer to him.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You have no idea, do you?

     DANIEL
     No. No, I don't.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You've tried accessing it but it's always just out of reach, isn't
     it? I could help you. We could unlock the knowledge of the Ancients,
     the secrets of the universe, together.

     DANIEL
     I have to admit it does sound interesting.

   [Replicator Carter looks at Daniel, smiling slightly.]

     DANIEL
     On the other hand, you're an evil killing machine, so no, I'll pass.

   [Replicator Carter's smile fades. Suddenly, Daniel frowns and grimaces
   as though in pain.]

   Flashback

   [Ascended Daniel attempts to destroy Anubis (Full Circle 6.22) Daniel
   raises his hands and directs the energy at Anubis. The energy is blown
   back as Anubis raises his hand to defend himself.]

     DANIEL
     No, don't do this!

   End Flashback

   [Daniel glares at Replicator Carter, shocked at the sudden memory.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You had the power. You were about to strike but she stopped you.

     DANIEL
     No, I don't believe you. You can make me see whatever you want,
     that's just a trick.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You know it's true.

   [Daniel looks uncertain.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Destroying the weapon that can destroy me is one thing. A good thing
     for me, but there is more. There is a way to kill Anubis in your
     mind, and so much more. I am not done, Daniel Jackson. Far from it.
     In fact, we have only just begun.

   [Daniel stares at Replicator Carter, frowning and breathing hard.]

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE

   [The wall containing the Ancient text is littered with stuck-on paper.
   A number of circles appear to be inlaid in the wall. Jacob is reading
   one of Daniel's notebooks as Carter stands next to the wall.]

     CARTER
     'Midday, the darkness is high in the sky'? You sure about that?

     SELMAK
     That is what it says.

     CARTER
     It doesn't make much sense.

     JACOB
     Yeah, well neither does, 'the wind blows on the pillow' or 'three
     days to the chicken.' But that's what these phrases apparently
     translate into.

     CARTER
     Are you saying this whole wall of writing is nonsense?

     JACOB
     I don't know what I'm saying.

     CARTER
     Is it possible you made a mistake?

   [He holds Daniel's book out to her.]

     SELMAK
     Would you care to try?

   [Carter shakes her head slightly, and turns back to the wall. She picks
   up another notebook from the floor.]

     SELMAK
     The text is quite difficult, and if there is an organizing principle
     to Doctor Jackson's notes, I have yet to discover it.

     CARTER
     Yeah, he certainly has his own system.

     TEAL'C

     (over radio)
     Colonel Carter.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Go ahead, Teal'c.

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     TEAL'C
     Have you had any success with the translation?

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE

   [Carter grimaces.]

     CARTER
     We're making... some progress.

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac are at the ship's controls, with Aron at the
   weapons console.]

     TEAL'C
     I am afraid you do not have much more time. Our long range scanners
     have detected Ba'al's fleet.

   [The viewscreen shows the planet, with the Jaffa forces in orbit. A
   large number of fast-moving ships are heading towards the fleet.]

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE

     CARTER
     Understood.

   [She looks at Jacob then turns back to study the wall.]

   INT--TENT

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     It would be much easier on both of us if you did not resist.

     DANIEL
     Why, why, why, why, in the wide world of all things rational and
     sane, would I help you?

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Because deep down you also want the knowledge I seek.

     DANIEL
     Yes, but the problem is, anything I learn I won't be able to put to
     much use because right after I'm done, you're going to kill me.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     What if I promised not to?

     DANIEL

     (laughing)
     Yeah.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Do you really think I am that different from Samantha Carter?

     DANIEL
     In that you're a Replicator, bent on galactic domination at the
     expense of all living things...

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Her thoughts, her memories, even her emotions, they are not
     meaningless to me. I do not wish to harm you or destroy Earth, for
     that matter. I could have done that already if I so desired.

     DANIEL
     You're saying you'll leave Earth untouched?

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     I promise you that. And your life.

   [Daniel looks at Replicator Carter, obviously thinking.]

     DANIEL
     No. No, not going to help you. But obviously I can't do anything to
     stop you so... give it your best shot.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE

   [Jacob is still studying the notebook as Carter examines the wall.]

     CARTER
     What if it's a code?

     SELMAK
     Something that could only be deciphered by someone who understands
     the language.

     CARTER
     Can I see that?

   [Carter takes the clipboard containing Daniel's notes but does not turn
   it right side up.]

     SELMAK
     You're holding it upside down.

     CARTER
     I know. I just noticed, upside down these symbols look like another
     word I've seen before.

   [She turns the clipboard to show Selmak, who takes it and looks at it.]

     SELMAK
     Right side up, it's darkness. You turn it around and... it
     translates into sun.

     CARTER
     'Midday the sun is high in the sky.' That makes a lot more sense.

     JACOB
     Yeah, but so what? That's not what the wall says.

   [Carter turns to look at the wall. She walks up to it and begins to
   slowly turn one of the inlaid circle. Jacob walks nearer to the wall
   and begins to smile.]

     CARTER
     Now it does.

   [Carter turns to Jacob.]

     JACOB
     It can't be that simple. Just turn all five circles upside down?

     CARTER
     No, I agree. It has to be some sort of combination lock. We just
     need to figure out which circles to turn.

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

   [Ba'al appears on the viewscreen.]

     BA'AL
     Your pathetic trickery will only delay your inevitable defeat.

     TEAL'C
     There is no trickery at hand. We know that inevitably your goal is
     to eradicate all free Jaffa. We have sent the bulk of our fleet to
     safety, to survive, to fight another day.

     BA'AL
     Surrender now or be destroyed.

     TEAL'C
     Defeat those who remain and you will be forced to destroy the weapon
     on Dakara yourself. Then you must face Anubis.

   [Ba'al's image disappears from the screen.]

     BRA'TAC
     His fleet appears to be holding position.

     TEAL'C
     For the moment.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE

   [Carter turns another circle. As it sets into place, the ground begins
   to shake. She picks up her weapon as a number of Jaffa run into the
   temple.]

     CARTER
     Let's hope that's not a bad sign.

   [She gestures for the Jaffa to stop. The wall rises up and Carter
   raises her weapon. Another wall behind splits open to reveal a room.]

     JACOB
     Nice going, Sam.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [Carter and Jacob step into the darkened room. In the centre is a large
   platform on which is an alien device, with large stone panels set into
   it. Carter and Jacob walk up to the platform.]

     CARTER
     We're in business.

   [Jacob nods.]

   EXT--SGC COMPLEX. DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Harriman is sitting at a monitor and is turned to face O'Neill, who is
   sitting at a microphone. The Stargate's iris is closed. Carter's voice
   is coming through the comms system.]

     CARTER
     It's definitely of Ancient design, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Think our bomb will do the trick?

     CARTER
     We'll soon see. Give us ten minutes. Carter out.

   [O'Neill looks at his watch.]

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [Jacob is studying the device as Carter drags a case into the room.
   Carter opens the case and removes a bomb from it. Jacob gently touches
   the top panel of the device. Suddenly, a viewscreen appears behind him,
   with Ancient text scrolling on the screen.]

     JACOB
     Sam?

   [Carter looks up from preparing the bomb.]

     JACOB
     You might want to hold off on that for a minute.

   [Carter stands and walks over to the device.]

     JACOB
     If I'm reading this screen right, the weapon uses an energy wave to
     reduce all matter to its basic molecular elements. It's not strong
     enough to disintegrate an entire planet but it will wash away
     everything on a planet's surface and anything in the surrounding
     space.

     CARTER
     Sounds bad.

     JACOB
     I know, but it also sounds like it does it much the same way your
     disruptor technology works on the Replicators. By separating the
     individual components.

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER
     They are both Ancient design. General O'Neill did use Ancient
     knowledge to build the disruptor.

     JACOB
     I know.

     CARTER
     You think this weapon can be modified to work only on the
     Replicators?

     JACOB
     I don't know, but I'd hate to blow it up before I was a 100 percent
     sure it couldn't.

   [Carter nods.]

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Teal'c, do you read?

     TEAL'C
     Proceed, Colonel Carter.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Look... umm... my Dad and Selmak think this weapon may hold the key
     to defeating the Replicators and we'll need some time to find out.
     Just let us know when things get bad and we'll blow it and get out.

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     TEAL'C
     Understood.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Carter out.

   [The viewscreen shows Ba'al's fleet nearing.]

     ARON
     Ba'al's fleet just began moving into attack position.

     BRA'TAC
     It appears things are about to get... bad.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [Jacob is working on a laptop computer which has been set up on the
   device.]

     JACOB
     I'm not getting anything.

   [Jacob moves aside to let Carter at the computer.]

     CARTER
     This may not be possible, you know.

     JACOB
     Come on, Sam. It can't be any harder than blowing up a sun!

     CARTER
     You know, you blow up one sun and suddenly everyone expects you to
     walk on water.

   [Suddenly, the computer screen clears and Ancient text appears.]

     JACOB
     There you go.

     CARTER
     Ah! Next step, parting the Red Sea.

   [They both smile.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Ba'al's ships are attacking the rebel Jaffa fleet.]

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

   [The ship shudders continuously from weapons hits. Bra'tac grimaces.]

     TEAL'C
     Shields are down fifty percent.

     ARON
     We cannot take much more.

     BRA'TAC
     Signal the other Ha'tak. Begin retreating, sub-light engines only,
     full power.

   INT--BA'AL'S SHIP

   [Ba'al is sitting on his throne flanked by a couple of krull warriors.
   A number of Jaffa are manning the controls.]

     JAFFA
     The rebels are fleeing, my Lord. The planet is ours.

     BA'AL
     They expect us to follow, so that they may draw the fleet into
     battle on two fronts.

   [The Jaffa looks puzzled.]

     BA'AL
     Signal the fleet to pursue the Shol'va.

     JAFFA
     My Lord?

     BA'AL
     Dakara can wait. No battle strategy can save them now. We will crush
     them, and then take the temple.

     JAFFA
     Yes, my Lord.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [The laptop monitor shows an analysis graph.]

     JACOB
     I'm pretty sure this output is giving us the frequency spectrum of
     the wave the weapon uses to disintegrate matter.

     CARTER
     That's nothing like the spectrum analysis of the Replicator
     disruptor wave. Here, look.

   [Carter bring up a much different analysis graph on the screen.]

     JACOB
     Yeah, I know, but all we have to do is alter the settings on the
     weapon consoles so that the output wave matches that of the
     disruptor technology.

     CARTER
     All we have to do?

     JACOB
     Yeah. The device can be set by varying the height of these panels.

   [He slowly pushes one of the panels down. The analysis graph changes
   significantly.]

     CARTER
     Oh. Well, I can run a program to compare the difference between the
     two waves. It should let us know if we're even going in the right
     direction.

     JACOB
     That's good.

     CARTER
     You know, even if we can make this work, the Replicators were
     quickly able to adapt themselves to the frequency modulation Thor
     made to the original disruptor wave.

     JACOB
     What are you saying?

     CARTER
     We realised the only way to eliminate the Replicators and not allow
     them time to develop immunity, was to somehow hit them all at the
     same time.

     JACOB
     Everywhere in the galaxy? How are we supposed to do that?

     CARTER
     The weapon translates through the Stargate. Do you think Anubis was
     planning to use the weapon to attack one planet at a time?

     JACOB
     So dial multiple gates, simultaneously.

     CARTER
     Not multiple gates. All of them.

     JACOB
     Every Stargate in the galaxy, at one time? Do you know how many
     gates there are in the whole galaxy?

     CARTER
     A lot.

     SELMAK
     I have no idea how to alter a Stargate to perform such a function. I
     don't know of anyone who can.

   [Carter grimaces.]

     CARTER
     I think I know someone.

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     TEAL'C
     Are you certain, Colonel Carter?

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     I don't think we have a choice, Teal'c. I mean, this could be the
     best chance we'll ever get.

   [Teal'c and Bra'tac turn to look at each other.]

     TEAL'C
     Understood.

     TEAL'C

     (to Bra'tac)
     Open a channel.

   [Ba'al appears on the viewscreen.]

     BA'AL
     No doubt you have decided to surrender. A wise decision given that
     you face imminent defeat.

     TEAL'C
     We have no intention of surrendering. I merely wished to inform you
     that we have found the Ancient weapon on Dakara.

     BA'AL
     Do you intend to destroy it?

     TEAL'C
     That would be foolish. We have learned that the Ancient weapon may
     be the means to destroy the Replicators once and for all.

   INT--TENT

   [Replicator Carter is accessing Daniel's mind. She opens her eyes in
   amazement.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     It's incredible, yet you still resist me.

   [Daniel is frowning, breathing quickly.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Do you not care? Are you not amazed by what you are seeing?

     DANIEL
     I don't understand it. It's more than any human can begin to
     comprehend.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     I am not human.

     DANIEL
     Oh, believe me, I know. There must be a limit to how much your mind
     can process, how much information you can store.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     I am sharing what I learn with my brethren. The extent of knowledge
     we can absorb is only limited by our numbers. As we speak, those
     numbers are growing faster than you can imagine.

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [Carter and Jacob are still working at the laptop. Suddenly, Ba'al's
   holographic image appears. He looks around the room.]

     BA'AL
     This chamber must be well shielded. I could not find it using my
     ship's sensors.

     CARTER
     Look, I assume Teal'c told you the plan?

     BA'AL
     What makes you think you can modify this weapon to defeat
     Replicators?

     CARTER
     We're already on our way to doing that.

   [She turns the laptop so that he can see it. The two differing analysis
   graphs are on the screen, plus a countdown number.]

     CARTER
     We need to get this weapon's wave output to match our modified
     Replicator disruptor wave, to within a margin of point seven six
     percent.

     BA'AL
     How did you develop this Replicator disruptor technology in the
     first place?

     CARTER
     General O'Neill built it, using Ancient knowledge and an Asgard
     computer.

   [Carter changes the laptop screen to show a blueprint of the disruptor
   weapon.]

     BA'AL
     O'Neill. The mere thought of that makes me sick.

     CARTER
     Look, if we can do this and somehow hit the Replicators all at the
     same time, we think it will work. But we need your help.

     BA'AL
     You want me to re-program the Stargate to dial every gate in the
     galaxy simultaneously?

     CARTER
     I know you used the gate's automatic update program to disseminate a
     dialling program virus to the entire gate network.

     BA'AL
     With a virus you initially planted in my Stargate.

     CARTER
     No-one's trying to deny that we're mortal enemies here. Can you do
     it or not?

   [Ba'al smirks.]

     BA'AL
     I cannot believe I'm even considering co-operating with a female of
     the Tau'ri, and a Tok'ra.

     SELMAK
     This was not my idea, believe me.

     BA'AL
     I'll instruct my troops to land.

     CARTER
     No way. You send one Jaffa down here and the deal's off.

     BA'AL
     I cannot do what you ask by means of a hologram transmission.

     CARTER
     Sure you can. Just tell me what to do.

     (over PA system)
     Unscheduled Offworld Activation.

     O'NEILL
     Is that Carter?

     HARRIMAN
     No, Sir. We are picking up a radio signal.

     O'NEILL
     Put it on speaker.

   [Only interference is coming over the speaker.]

     O'NEILL
     Sergeant?

     HARRIMAN
     I don't know, Sir.

   [Suddenly, the monitors quickly start flashing through blueprint-type
   images of various Stargates.]

     O'NEILL
     What the hell is that?

     HARRIMAN
     I'm not sure, Sir. I can't access the system. Looks like something's
     hacked into the computer remotely.

     O'NEILL
     Shut it down.

     HARRIMAN
     I can't, Sir, I'm locked out!

     O'NEILL
     Damn.

   [O'Neill picks up a communications telephone.]

     O'NEILL
     This is General O'Neill.

   [The Stargate's iris opens.]

     HARRIMAN
     Sir!

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

   [SFs line up, ready to fire. Replicators come swarming through the gate
   and the SFs fire on them.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill looks out to the gateroom, shocked.]

     O'NEILL

     (into comms system)
     Evacuate the gateroom. Get out of there!

   INT--SGC GATEROOM

   [The SFs begin to retreat.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Harriman)
     Close the blast doors.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [As the last SF leaves, one replicator jumps up between the door and
   the wall, keeping the door from closing. An SF shoots it and the blast
   door slams shut.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     O'NEILL

     (into PA system)
     Initiate base lockdown. Emergency evacuation of all personnel
     through alternate routes. Self destruct protocol, on my order.

     O'NEILL
     Let's go, Walter. Let's get out of here!

   INT--SGC COMPLEX

   [The huge external blast doors start to close.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Personnel are climbing up escape hatches. O#Neill passes a number of
   personnel waiting to leave.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh, man.

     REYNOLDS
     Sir.

   [O'Neill walks up to Reynolds.]

     REYNOLDS
     We're cut off from the self destruct. They were too fast. Even if we
     could fight through them now there's a good chance they've already
     disabled the activation mechanism.

     O'NEILL
     Those bugs cannot get out of this mountain.

   [They start walking along the corridor.]

     REYNOLDS
     It's only a matter of time before they gain control of the base
     systems and override the security doors.

     O'NEILL
     Alright! Let's make sure everybody's out of here and then we'll toss
     a little nuke down the silo.

     REYNOLDS
     Think that'll stop them?

     O'NEILL
     It should slow them down.

   INT--TENT

   [Replicator Carter is still reading Daniel's subconscious. Daniel,
   frowning, suddenly opens his eyes. Replicator Carter also opens her
   eyes, seemingly surprised and confused. Daniel stares at her.]

     DANIEL
     You can't handle it, can you?

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     I can. I just need time to process, share it with the others.

     DANIEL
     Like the universe, it's infinite. It's not just knowledge and
     information, it's understanding on a level that you will never
     reach.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     Why do you think that?

     DANIEL
     Because you're a machine.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     So are you. Just of weaker construction.

     DANIEL
     And that's where you're wrong.

   [Replicator Carter smirks at Daniel.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     We'll see.

   [Daniel returns the smirk.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill is searching the corridor, holding a P-90 ready. A number of
   SFs are with him.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over radio)
     General Hammond says the President has authorised deployment of a
     ten kiloton nuclear bomb, on your command, Sir. An emergency state
     of alert has been issued in a two hundred square mile radius around
     Cheyenne Mountain, and is currently being evacuated. A transport
     helicopter is waiting on the surface for you and the remaining
     personnel.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Thank you, Walter.

   [Reynolds comes up to O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Colonel?

     REYNOLDS
     We have a problem, Sir. Six SGC personnel are trapped in Level 8.
     They're cut off from the emergency escape hatch.

     O'NEILL
     Siler?

   [Reynolds nods.]

     REYNOLDS
     Siler.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, Siler. Let's go.

   INT--TENT

   [Replicator Carter is again reading Daniel's mind. They look at each,
   surprised.]

     DANIEL
     You lied to me.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     What?

     DANIEL
     You promised you'd leave Earth alone. There's Replicators
     infiltrating the SGC right now.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     How can you know that?

   [Daniel simply looks at her.]

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     While I was in your mind, you were inside mine.

     DANIEL
     Took a while to figure out. Fortunately, you were too distracted to
     notice. Some of the Ancient knowledge really helped too, thank you.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You tricked me.

     DANIEL
     You tricked me first.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     You should never have told me.

     DANIEL
     Too late. For you that is.

   [She raises her hand to hit him, but he grabs her wrist.]

     DANIEL
     Trying to leave? Sorry. A little more time in Danny's world.

     REPLICATOR CARTER
     My brethren will not stop. You cannot control them.

     DANIEL
     Not yet, but I'm learning.

   EXT--DAKARA

   INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

   [Jacob is still working at the monitor. The difference between the two
   waves is 38 but as the panels change it lowers to 8. Carter runs in.]

     CARTER
     We've rigged the DHD to dial automatically on signal when the
     weapon's ready. I think it should work.

   [Ba'al's hologram appears.]

     BA'AL
     Of course it will work. How dare you doubt me.

   [Jacob grimaces.]

     JACOB
     What's he still doing here?

     CARTER

     (quietly, to Jacob)
     I can't exactly ask him to leave. How's it going on your end?

     JACOB
     I'm getting closer.

   [Ba'al points at a panel.]

     BA'AL
     This one.

   [Jacob studies the monitor.]

     JACOB
     How do you know?

   [Ba'al smirks.]

     BA'AL
     I am a God. Gods are all-knowing.

   [Carter rolls her eyes. Jacob stares at Ba'al then turns to Carter.]

     JACOB

     (quietly, to Carter)
     Selmak can't work like this. Neither can I.

     CARTER

     (quietly)
     Just try it.

   [Jacob pushes down the panel which Ba'al indicated. The differential
   lowers to 4. Jacob glares at Ba'al.]

     JACOB
     Lucky guess.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Reynolds make their way slowly through the darkened
   corridors. They stop at the blast door to Level 8. Reynolds passes his
   access card down the reader but the door stays closed. He shakes his
   head at O'Neill]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Siler, you in there?

     SILER

     (over radio)
     Yes, Sir.

     SILER

     (into radio)
     Yes, Sir.

   [He turns away from the door.]

     SILER
     Let's get this table over.

   [He and the others in the room place a large metal table on its side.
   They crouch down behind it.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR LEVEL 8

   [Reynolds places explosive on the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Use two of those things.

   [Reynolds looks at O'Neill, surprised.]

     REYNOLDS
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     It's a blast door!

   [Reynolds places a second block of explosive above the first. Once it's
   in place, they move around the corner.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Hang on, Siler.

   [O'Neill prepares the detonator.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Fire in the hole.

   INT--SGC LEVEL 8

     SILER
     Down!

   [He and the other personnel lower their heads.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR LEVEL 8

   [The door explodes open, flames shooting out into the corridor.]

   INT--SGC LEVEL 8

   [Siler raises slowly to his knees. He looks over the table, noticing a
   large shard of shrapnel embedded in the table top.]

     SILER
     Wow!

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR LEVEL 8

   [O'Neill and Reynolds walk up to the jagged doorway.]

     O'NEILL
     Siler!

   [Siler climbs through the doorway.]

     SILER
     Thank you, Sir!

   [O'Neill hands him a weapon.]

     O'NEILL
     I expect to be put in your will.

     SILER
     Already in it, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, that's... weird.

   [The others leave the Level 8 room and follow O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Reynolds make their way carefully down the corridor
   looking for Replicators, followed by the other personnel. Over the
   alarm, they hear the sound of Replicators along the corridor.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah, crap!

   [Reynolds and a couple of SFs crouch down, preparing their weapons. As
   the Replicators turn the corner towards them, they fire. The
   Replicators swarm towards them.]

   rises to 4.]

     That one took us in the wrong direction.

     JACOB
     All-knowing, huh?

   [The hologram image flickers. Ba'al looks away.]

     CARTER
     What's the matter?

     BA'AL
     My ships are under attack. A massive Replicator controlled fleet is
     encroaching on the planet.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   number of Replicators make their way to an escape hatch.]

     Fall back.

   [They leave the area.]

   INT--REBEL JAFFA MOTHERSHIP

     Are we not better off letting them destroy each other?

     Yeah, you know Walter, right now we're having a slightly difficult

     he can pull the trigger on that nuke, do it. Do you read?

     HARRIMAN

     Yes, Sir.

     Yes, Sir.

     REYNOLDS
     Sir?

     O'NEILL
     You see those bugs go into that hatch?

     REYNOLDS
     Yes, Sir. You think, on the base, it's their primary hole?

     O'NEILL
     It's a fairly safe bet. They're going to the surface.

     REYNOLDS
     It may be the only other way out of here accessible.

     Prepare enough squads to board them, and reclaim them in the name of
     their God.

     JAFFA
     Yes, my Lord. We are being hailed.

     BA'AL
     On screen.

   [Teal'c appears on the viewscreen.]

     TEAL'C
     Surrender now and you will be granted mercy.

   [Ba'al smirks.]

     BA'AL
     You are hardly in any position to be making such ridiculous demands.
     You are surrounded.

     TEAL'C
     You are incorrect. It is, in fact, you that is surrounded, by free
     Jaffa.

   [Suddenly, the Krull warriors flanking Ba'al are shot. Bra'tac and a
   number of Jaffa enter. Teal'c looks on, smirking, as Ba'al's Jaffa are
   overpowered and Ba'al is surrounded by rebel Jaffa.]

     BRA'TAC
     Behold your false God.

   [Ba'al looks at Bra'tac and laughs. He activates a wrist device and
   beams off the ship before Bra'tac can shoot him. Bra'tac, shocked,
   turns to the viewscreen and shakes his head at Teal'c, who raises an
   eyebrow.]

   EXT--SGC COMPLEX DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDORS

   [O'Neill and Carter walk up the stairs to his office.]

     O'NEILL
     Any more word from Teal'c?

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir. Although Ba'al got away, the fact that he turned tail and
     ran made the rebel victory every bit the turning point Teal'c and
     Bra'tac were hoping for. Jaffa from all over the galaxy are joining
     with them.

     O'NEILL
     Well, viva la revolution!

     CARTER
     They're a significant sized fleet securing Dakara. Hopefully, with
     the weapons we've provided they'll be able to turn the tide against
     Anubis' super soldiers.

   INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

   [They enter his office, both standing on either side of O'Neill's
   desk.]

     CARTER
     It looks like the Jaffa might finally win their freedom.

   [O'Neill picks up a folder.]

     O'NEILL
     It's about time.

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir. Oh! I heard from Thor.

     O'NEILL
     How's he doing?

   [O'Neill sits.]

     CARTER
     Great! He sends us all his congratulations and says that he will
     drop by for a visit as soon as his consciousness has been downloaded
     from the ship's computer into a new body.

     O'NEILL
     That just never gets old, does it?

     CARTER
     Apparently not.

   [Carter smiles.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, did you notice if the Replicators where you were happened
     to... stop in the middle of everything?

     CARTER
     Yeah, it was really strange, they just...

     CARTER & O'NEILL

     (together)
     Froze.

     CARTER
     It actually bought us the time we needed to calibrate the weapon.

     O'NEILL
     Any idea why that happened?

     CARTER
     You think Daniel had something to do with it?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know.

     CARTER
     Sir, if he was onboard that Replicator ship, then...

     O'NEILL
     Carter! We don't know anything.

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER
     No, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     Anything else?

     CARTER
     No, Sir.

   [O'Neill turns to his paperwork. Carter looks at him for a moment,
   shrugs, then leaves. O'Neill begins to write, but after she leaves he
   stops. He looks up, worried, and is obviously thinking about Daniel.]
