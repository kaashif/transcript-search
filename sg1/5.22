   PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1

   [Scenes from Summit where Yu objects to Anubis being made a System
   Lord. Scenes from Meridian where Carter says Daniel has had a lethal
   dose of radiation and him in the infirmary. Daniel also tells O'Neill
   he'll miss SG-1 and then he ascends.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A Goa'uld mothership is orbiting a planet. An Asgard ship comes out of
   hyperspace.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

   [Osiris is on the peltak, viewing the two ships through the screen.]

     JAFFA
     The ship is Asgard. We are being hailed.

   [Thor appears on the viewscreen.]

     THOR
     I am Thor. Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet. Your presence here
     is a violation of the Protected Planets Treaty and you must withdraw
     immediately.

     OSIRIS
     I don't think so.

     THOR
     If you do not comply, I will be forced to open fire.

     OSIRIS
     Yes, I suppose you will.

     THOR
     You will be destroyed.

     OSIRIS
     I am the great god Osiris and gods cannot be destroyed. You should
     know that.

     THOR
     Very well.

     JAFFA
     Enemy ship is powering weapons.

   [Thor fires on Osiris but the weapons fire is absorbed by the shields.]

     JAFFA
     Shields are holding.

     JAFFA 2
     The ship remains undamaged.

     OSIRIS
     Our days of bowing to the Asgard are finally over.

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC--DANIEL'S LAB

   [Carter is looking at his books, visibly mourning. She moves to his
   desk and picks up his glasses. She then sees his journal and picks it
   up. Hammond stands at the door.]

     HAMMOND
     Major.

     CARTER
     Sir.

   [Hammond enters.]

     HAMMOND
     I just wanted to inform you that Colonel O'Neill has requested that
     SG-1 remain on active duty while we try to find a replacement for
     Doctor Jackson.

     CARTER
     So what are we supposed to do? Keep working like nothing happened?

     HAMMOND
     I understand how you feel.

     CARTER
     With all due respect, Sir, I don't even understand how I feel. We
     didn't even have a memorial service.

     HAMMOND
     We're not even really sure that he's dead.

     CARTER
     And that's the problem. What are we supposed to do, Sir? Wait and...
     and hope that he comes back or... or just move on.

   [Hammond walks round to face Carter.]

     HAMMOND
     When I was in Vietnam, I saw my best friend shot down. I know he
     survived, I saw his `chute open, radioed his position. But I never
     found out what happened to him. His body was never recovered, the
     Vietnamese never admitted they took him prisoner. For years, I kept
     thinking, that some day he's just going to walk through the door.

     CARTER
     So what did you do?

     HAMMOND
     I learned to live with it.

   [The klaxons go off.]

     PA SYSTEM
     Unauthorized off world activation.

   [The power goes off.]

     HAMMOND
     What the hell's going on?

     CARTER
     Main power is down.

   [She goes to a phone.]

     CARTER
     Phones are down.

   [The emergency power comes on.]

     PA SYSTEM
     General Hammond to the Gateroom, repeat General Hammond to the
     Gateroom.

     HAMMOND
     Let's get up there.

   [He leaves and Carter replaces Daniel's journal.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Carter and Hammond walk in. A number of SFs are aiming their weapons
   at the gate.]

     HAMMOND
     Stand down.

   [Freyr walks down the ramp.]

     CARTER
     Freyr.

     FREYR
     Major Carter. General Hammond. I apologise for our absence of late
     but our war with the Replicators has reached a critical stage.

     CARTER
     Well, we might be able to help you with that.

     FREYR
     Yes, we received your message.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c enter.]

     FREYR
     If, as you say, this android was responsible for creating the first
     generation of Replicators, it may well prove invaluable. However, it
     is not the only reason I have come. There has been an incident with
     the Goa'uld.

     O'NEILL
     An incident?

     FREYR
     Commander Thor has been killed.

     CARTER
     Killed? How?

     FREYR
     The Goa'uld attacked a planet under our protection and Commander
     Thor was despatched with the only ship available. We expected the
     Goa'uld to retreat once we made our presence felt but they did not.
     The Asgard ship was destroyed in the ensuing battle.

     TEAL'C
     Is not Asgard military technology far superior to that of the
     Goa'uld?

     FREYR
     Their new shields are more advanced than we first believed and it
     appears they have upgraded their weapons as well. We can no longer
     be confident of victory when dealing with superior numbers.

     O'NEILL
     So in other words the protected planets are no longer protected?

     CARTER
     Including Earth.

     FREYR
     Our ability to enforce the treaty in this galaxy will depend greatly
     on the outcome of our battle with the Replicators. However, in the
     meantime, we do have another problem. An Asgard scientist has been
     left stranded in the research facility beneath the surface of the
     planet in question. We would like you to mount a rescue mission.

     HAMMOND
     Why us?

     FREYR
     We have no ships available and we understand you have a Goa'uld
     cargo ship at your disposal.

     CARTER
     Well, it isn't exactly in perfect working order. We managed to
     repair it with the help of the Tok'ra but...

     O'NEILL
     We'll do it.

   [Everyone looks at him, surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     It's what we do, isn't it?

     FREYR
     The research being conducted on this planet is vital to the future
     of the Asgard. We would be forever in your debt.

   [Freyr bows to O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Carter follows O'Neill down a corridor.]

     CARTER
     Colonel. We need to talk.

     O'NEILL
     I don't want to hear it, Carter.

     CARTER
     You can't just pretend this didn't happen.

     O'NEILL
     I'm not pretending anything. This is the job. We lose people all the
     time.

     CARTER
     We're talking about Daniel.

     O'NEILL
     What do you want me to do? He's gone. We've got work to do.

   [O'Neill walks off. Carter stops and turns round to go the other way.]

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   [SG-1 are en route to the Asgard protected planet. O'Neill is sitting
   in the back cleaning his gun. Carter and Teal'c are sitting up in the
   front.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you not all right, Major Carter?

     CARTER
     I'm fine.

     TEAL'C
     You continue to mourn the loss of Daniel Jackson.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I do. Tell me I'm not the only one.

     TEAL'C
     I will perform the proper rituals when the opportunity presents
     itself. Until that time, this mission must take priority.

     CARTER
     Please, Teal'c. Don't give me that `way of the warrior' crap. I get
     enough of that from Colonel O'Neill.

     TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson has ascended to a higher plane of existence. Many
     Jaffa have dedicated their lives to achieving such a goal.

     CARTER
     So I'm supposed to celebrate?

     TEAL'C
     It is a great accomplishment.

   [Carter is obviously upset.]

     CARTER
     We were a team, Teal'c. No one can even begin to understand what we
     went through together, what we mean to each other. So maybe Daniel
     has achieved something of great cosmic significance, I don't know.
     And to be honest with you, right now, I don't really care. I'd
     rather have him back.

     TEAL'C
     As would I.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The cargo ship approaches a wormhole.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     TEAL'C
     We are approaching the Adara system. Two motherships orbit the
     second planet.

   [O'Neill walks up.]

     CARTER
     We won't be able to activate the cloak until we come out of
     hyperspace. There'll be a brief interval where they might detect us.

     O'NEILL
     How brief?

     CARTER
     Just a few seconds. The odds of them spotting us are pretty slim.

     O'NEILL
     How slim?

     CARTER
     Hardly worth mentioning, Sir.

     O'NEILL
     And yet, you did mention it.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I'm beginning to wish I hadn't.

   [They come out of hyperspace and cloak.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, at least they're not shooting at us. That's good.

     TEAL'C
     We are approaching the upper atmosphere.

   [The cargo ship enters the atmosphere and judders.]

     CARTER
     It's pretty thick.

     TEAL'C
     There is considerable turbulence.

   [Teal'c activates the screen at the front on the ship. O'Neill holds
   onto the console.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, we should really consider putting another chair back here.
     If you think about it, it'd be much safer, wouldn't it?

   [The cargo ship lands.]

     TEAL'C
     We have arrived at the co-ordinates given to us by Freyr.

     O'NEILL
     Nice view.

     CARTER
     This can't be right. The atmosphere is over 80% carbon dioxide and
     the surface temperature of 420 degrees Fahrenheit.

     O'NEILL
     Ooh... hot.

     CARTER
     Yeah.

     TEAL'C
     How are we to locate the Asgard facility?

   [Suddenly the three of them are beamed out.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c appear.]

     CARTER
     Well, that was easy.

   [They look round.]

     ASGARD
     Ah, humans. Interesting.

   [Heimdall walks down a ramp waving. O'Neill waves back.]

     HEIMDALL
     Greetings, I am Heimdall. I assume you were sent by the Asgard High
     Council.

     O'NEILL
     Not exactly. Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Carter and Teal'c.

   [He shakes hands with Heimdall.]

     HEIMDALL
     I have heard much of your exploits on behalf of the Asgard. Doctor
     Jackson is not with you?

     O'NEILL
     Uh, no.

     HEIMDALL
     In any case, it is a great pleasure to meet you.

     CARTER
     Where are we exactly?

     HEIMDALL
     Several hundred metres beneath the surface of the planet.

     CARTER
     Of course we'd have to be. The surface is uninhabitable.

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld are unaware of your presence here?

     HEIMDALL
     I have been monitoring their communications. They know the
     laboratory is somewhere on this planet but as yet, they have been
     unable to pinpoint its location.

     O'NEILL
     Well, why don't we get out of here before they find out?

     HEIMDALL
     I am afraid we cannot leave.

     CARTER
     Why not?

     HEIMDALL
     First we must rescue Thor.

     CARTER
     I thought Thor was dead?

     HEIMDALL
     He is not. However, his life is in grave danger. He is a prisoner of
     the Goa'uld.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

   [Thor is being held strapped to a table. Osiris walks in.]

     OSIRIS
     Commander Thor. I apologise for the accommodations but we weren't
     expecting company.

     THOR
     You have committed an act of war against the Asgard. The response
     will be swift and decisive.

     OSIRIS
     As swift and decisive as your attempt to defend this planet?

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     HEIMDALL
     After Thor's ship was destroyed, the Goa'uld detected an escape pod.
     They managed to retrieve it before it could disappear into the
     atmosphere.

     CARTER
     How do you know Thor is still alive?

     HEIMDALL
     I am able to scan the interior of the Goa'uld mother ship.

   [A screen appears behind SG-1.]

     O'NEILL
     Wow.

     HEIMDALL
     I have located Thor's bio signature here.

     O'NEILL
     Why don't you just beam him out?

     HEIMDALL
     Although my sensors can penetrate the Goa'uld shields, my
     transportation device cannot.

     CARTER
     Can you detect Goa'uld lifesigns as well?

     HEIMDALL
     I can.

   [The screen changes to show a red symbol for a Goa'uld with Thor's blue
   symbol.]

     HEIMDALL
     The red dot indicates the presence of a symbiote.

     CARTER
     So it's either Goa'uld or a Jaffa.

     HEIMDALL
     In all probability, Thor is being tortured for information
     pertaining to Asgard technology.

     CARTER
     With that kind of knowledge, the Goa'uld could easily come through
     our Stargate whenever they wanted. There wouldn't be anything we
     could do about it.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

   [Thor is still lying strapped to the table.]

     THOR
     I've underestimated your strength. That mistake will not be made
     again.

     OSIRIS
     Perhaps not. But next time we will have an even greater advantage.
     We'll have learned all your secrets.

     THOR
     I will never surrender my knowledge to you.

     OSIRIS
     Not to me, no. Anubis himself has taken an interest in this matter.
     He's on his way here as we speak.

   [Osiris leaves.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [SG-1 are watching the screen.]

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld is leaving.

     O'NEILL
     Can you communicate with him?

     HEIMDALL
     Yes, I can.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

   [O'Neill appears as a hologram to Thor.]

     O'NEILL
     Thor. Thor, buddy.

   [Thor opens his eyes.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey. How you doing?

     THOR
     O'Neill. I am surprised to see you.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, we're down on the planet with...

     THOR
     Heimdall.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, him. Working on a way to get you out of here.

     THOR
     That would be unwise. You must take Heimdall and his research
     materials and leave immediately.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [O'Neill is bent over, as his hologram image speaks to Thor.]

     O'NEILL
     What are you nuts? I'm not gonna leave you behind.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

     THOR
     More Goa'uld are coming. I have been informed that Anubis will be
     conducting my interrogation.

     O'NEILL
     All the more reason to get you out.

     THOR
     I will resist their attempts to probe my mind. I will die before I
     give them any information, but the very survival of the Asgard
     depends on Heimdall's discoveries.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter sees four red symbols moving to Thor's cell.]

     CARTER
     Sir, you've got company, we're gonna have to pull you out.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

     O'NEILL
     All right, listen. I've got to go but I'll be back.

   [O'Neill disappears.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [O'Neill walks up to Carter and Teal'c.]

     CARTER
     How's he doing?

     O'NEILL
     Well, he's fine for now. Except for the fact that he wants us to
     leave him behind.

     TEAL'C
     For what reason?

     O'NEILL
     I wouldn't mind knowing that myself.

   [They look to Heimdall.]

     HEIMDALL
     Thor is no doubt concerned that if we delay, the materials in this
     laboratory will fall into the hands of the Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     What exactly are you studying here?

     HEIMDALL
     I am conducting research into the genetic history of the Asgard.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, now see, that doesn't sound like something worth dying for.

     HEIMDALL
     That is because you do not understand the gravity of the situation.

     O'NEILL
     Feel free to enlighten us.

     HEIMDALL
     As a race, the Asgard reproduce exclusively through a process of
     enhanced cellular mitosis.

     CARTER
     Are you serious? You have no other means of propagation?

     HEIMDALL
     No.

   [Carter looks surprised.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     They're clones, sir. All of them.

     O'NEILL
     Ah. Well, that answers a few questions.

     HEIMDALL
     In fact, for nearly a thousand years, we have been physically
     incapable of achieving cell division through meiosis.

   [O'Neill looks questioningly at Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Hmm?

     CARTER
     Sexual reproduction, Sir.

     O'NEILL

     Ah. (to Heimdall)
     A thousand years?

     HEIMDALL
     It is not something we usually discuss with other races.

     O'NEILL
     This I understand.

     HEIMDALL
     Through cloning we have achieved a measure of immortality. As each
     Asgard's body fails, his consciousness is transferred into a newer,
     younger version of himself. Unfortunately, the lack of genetic
     diversity has become a problem.

     CARTER
     It's like making a copy of a copy of a copy. Eventually there's
     deterioration.

     HEIMDALL
     We created a process of controlled mutation which has helped us to
     avoid complete genetic breakdown. But we are at the limits of our
     technical capabilities. The truth is, the Asgard are a dying race.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP

   [Osiris walks onto the peltak.]

     OSIRIS
     Have you located the Asgard facility?

     JAFFA
     Not yet, my Lord.

     OSIRIS
     You waste time. Lord Yu is mounting an offensive. Our ships are
     needed elsewhere.

     JAFFA
     The planet's atmosphere generates much electromagnetic interference.

     OSIRIS
     Then send a squadron of gliders. At low altitude their sensors will
     be more effective.

     JAFFA
     The atmosphere is too thick. It would be extremely dangerous for the
     pilots.

     OSIRIS
     And how dangerous will it be when Lord Anubis arrives and you have
     nothing to offer but excuses?

     JAFFA
     I will despatch the squadron myself.

     OSIRIS
     Very wise.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     CARTER
     If Anubis is gonna interrogate Thor, he'll have to ring aboard the
     ship. Once they lower the shields to let him in, we can beam Thor
     out.

     TEAL'C
     The shields will not be lowered, Major Carter. They will merely
     adjust the frequency to accept a rings transmission.

     CARTER
     Well, then we can use the rings on the cargo ship to beam up at the
     same time.

     TEAL'C
     Once Anubis is on board the frequency will be readjusted. And we
     will be trapped.

     O'NEILL
     So we take out the shields from the inside. There.

     HEIMDALL
     The shield generator room is located here.

   [An image of the interior of the ship appears.]

     HEIMDALL
     You can use explosives to disable the system and I will transport
     everyone out including Thor.

     TEAL'C
     Once the rings have been activated, the Goa'uld will be aware of our
     presence.

     CARTER
     Okay, one of us stays here and uses the Asgard scanner to direct the
     others away from any guards or patrols.

     HEIMDALL
     First, I must complete my preparations for departure.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, Carter you stay here, Teal'c and I will go up.

   [Carter nods in agreement.]

     HEIMDALL
     I must remind you, O'Neill, that time is of the essence. This
     laboratory will not remain undetected indefinitely.

   [O'Neill taps his watch face.]

     O'NEILL
     Right.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c leave.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A Goa'uld mothership emerges from hyperspace.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP

     JAFFA
     Lord Anubis has arrived.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter is at the control panel. Heimdall hands her a crystal that she
   attaches to her jacket.]

     CARTER

     (speaking into crystal)
     Sir, we've found a ring room that's clear. Stand by.

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Roger that.

   [Teal'c pushes the buttons to activate the rings.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     HEIMDALL
     A transporter ring has been activated.

     CARTER
     Now, Sir.

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Teal'c activates the rings and he and O'Neill ring up to the ship.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter watches the transport.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP

   [O'Neill and Teal'c ring in. Teal'c opens the doors and they move out.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter watches O'Neill and Teal'c on the Asgard scanners. O'Neill is a
   green symbol and Teal'c is red.]

     CARTER
     Monitoring your progress, Sir.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

     JAFFA
     There's been an unauthorised transport onto the ship.

     OSIRIS
     Intruders?

     JAFFA
     The signal appears to have come from the planet. I am unable to
     determine the specific co-ordinates.

     OSIRIS
     Organise a security detail. Maximum containment. I want them found.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c move down the corridor.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     CARTER
     Proceed to the end of the corridor and take a right.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c move to the end of the corridor.]

     CARTER
     Hold up, Sir, there's a large party headed your way.

     O'NEILL
     Which way? Should we double back? What?

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     CARTER
     No, Sir. There's a corridor up ahead on your left. You should be
     able to duck in there.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c move off as some Jaffa come their way. A hooded
   figure is among them. After the group passes, O'Neill and Teal'c start
   moving again.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     CARTER
     They're almost there.

   [The screen shows more red symbols.]

     CARTER
     Uh, oh. Sir, we've got a problem. There are several Jaffa patrols
     bearing down on your position.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

     O'NEILL
     Where? Which direction?

     CARTER
     They're coming at you from all directions, sir. Stand by.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter is looking at the screen seeing lots of red symbols.]

     CARTER
     There's no way out.

     HEIMDALL
     Perhaps a diversionary tactic would be in order?

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are waiting for information from Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter? Dammit.

   [They move off in one direction as a door rises behind them to reveal
   Jaffa. They walk down the corridor towards O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     CARTER
     Hey guys! What's happening?!

   [Carter suddenly appears behind the Jaffa. They turn and fire on her
   but the shots pass through her. She's a hologram. The diversion works
   and O'Neill and Teal'c have the element of surprise to fire on the
   Jaffa. The Jaffa are downed and O'Neill and Teal'c walk up to Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Nice.

   [Carter nods and looks behind.]

     CARTER
     Ah, Heimdall says the way ahead is clear.

     O'NEILL
     Let's move out.

   [They walk up to Carter and walk through her, O'Neill swatting his hand
   through Carter who looks bemused.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--THOR'S CELL

   [The door opens and Anubis walks in.]

     ANUBIS
     You are the one they call Thor. I am Anubis.

     THOR
     As I have told your Lieutenant, I will reveal nothing to you.

   [Anubis holds up a round device with spikes on it.]

     ANUBIS
     This device will be implanted into your brain, it will form a link
     between your mind and the ship's computer. Your knowledge will
     simply be downloaded into our memory banks. You will no doubt resist
     and you will no doubt fail.

     THOR
     The Goa'uld possess no such technology.

   [Anubis turns to look at Thor. The cowl partially hides his face of
   black sludge.]

     ANUBIS
     I think you will find many things have changed since my return.

   [Anubis leaves.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

   [A Jaffa enters and walks up to Osiris.]

     JAFFA
     The intruders have breached our security perimeter.

     OSIRIS
     How?

     JAFFA
     One of our patrols was ambushed.

     OSIRIS
     Seal the lower decks and divert coolant from the hyperdrive into the
     ventilation system.

   [The Jaffa turns to Osiris in shock.]

     JAFFA
     The gas is toxic.

     OSIRIS
     Only with prolonged exposure.

     JAFFA
     Shall I evacuate the engine room?

     OSIRIS
     The intruders may be monitoring our communications. We cannot afford
     to give them a warning.

     JAFFA
     But the engines will overheat and the entire compartment will be
     flooded with radiation. Many Jaffa will die.

     OSIRIS
     And they will be greatly honoured in the afterlife.

   [The Jaffa looks at another Jaffa and carries out the order.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c come to a door.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

   [Carter appears as a hologram.]

     CARTER
     This is it, Sir. The shield generator room is just on the other side
     of that door. There are six Jaffa inside.

     O'NEILL
     Only six?

   [There is the sound of gas and Teal'c suddenly topples over. O'Neill
   follows him to the floor.]

     CARTER
     Colonel! Teal'c!

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP ENGINE ROOM

   [Many Jaffa collapse.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

     CARTER
     Colonel!

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

     CARTER
     Are you sure they're not injured?

     HEIMDALL
     Their signals remain strong. They appear to have been taken to some
     kind of holding cell.

     CARTER
     Well, we've got to get them out of there.

     HEIMDALL
     How?

     CARTER
     I'm not sure yet.

     HEIMDALL
     In the meantime we must do all we can to keep the research materials
     in this laboratory from falling into Goa'uld hands.

     CARTER
     What exactly are we talking about here? Some DNA samples?

     HEIMDALL
     Not exactly.

   [Heimdall goes to the console and lowers a stasis pod containing a
   person that is a cross between an Asgard and human.]

     CARTER
     What is it?

     HEIMDALL
     That is one of my ancestors. Thirty thousand years ago a ship was
     launched from the Asgard homeworld, its crew placed in suspended
     animation. There was a failure on the navigational system and the
     ship was lost. Through the millennia it drifted across the empty
     expanse between our galaxies until it arrived here. We discovered it
     six months ago.

     CARTER
     And this is one of its original crew?

     HEIMDALL
     The only one that was perfectly preserved. He is from a time before
     our program of genetic manipulation became irreversible.

     CARTER
     So that's why he's so important. You're hoping his physiology can
     give you clues to stave off your own genetic degradation.

   [Heimdall nods.]

     HEIMDALL
     We kept the laboratory in this galaxy to avoid the threat of the
     Replicators. Now we can no longer afford to wait. It is only a
     matter of time before the Goa'uld pinpoint our location.

   [Heimdall beams himself, Carter and the pod up to the cargo ship.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

     HEIMDALL
     I will require your assistance to adapt the stasis pods in the cargo
     ship's power supply

     CARTER
     Right. When we're done I want you to beam me back to the lab. I'm
     not ready to give up on Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c just yet.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP CELL

   [O'Neill is lying on a bench and Teal'c is checking the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Can't believe they took my watch.

     TEAL'C
     Major Carter will soon have no choice but to leave with Heimdall.

     O'NEILL
     If she's smart, she's already gone.

   [Teal'c moves to sit with O'Neill.]

     TEAL'C
     In which case our chances of escape are negligible.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, I don't know. All we've gotta do is bust out of here, take out
     every Jaffa between here and the peltak, commandeer the ship and fly
     on home.

     TEAL'C
     I stand corrected.

   [Thor's voice suddenly comes out of nowhere.]

     THOR
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Thor? Is that you? Where are you?

     THOR
     I am still in my cell. However my mind has been linked with the
     ship's computer. And I am using the internal communication system to
     synthesise my voice.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

     THOR
     The Goa'uld are attempting to download the information stored in my
     pre-frontal cortex. It is only a matter of time before they break
     through my mental defences.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well, you know... love to help you but we've got our own
     problems here.

     THOR
     I am aware of your situation. I believe I may be able to rewrite
     some minor subroutines in the security protocol.

     TEAL'C
     To what end?

   [The door opens.]

     O'NEILL
     Sweet.

     THOR
     I am growing weak. Further communication will be impossible.

     O'NEILL
     Hang tight. We'll get you out.

   [O'Neill and Teal'c leave the cell and move off down the corridor.
   Carter the hologram appears behind them.]

     CARTER
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Still with us, huh?

     CARTER
     Yes, Sir. Heimdall's got the cargo ship prepped and ready to go. He
     can remote access his transportation device and beam us straight
     there but we still need you to get those shields offline.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, well they took our C4. So we won't be blowing any stuff up.

     CARTER
     We'd have to find a control relay and pull the crystals. It will
     only take them a few seconds to switch to backups but that should be
     all we need.

     O'NEILL
     Right. Which way?

     CARTER
     I'm going to have to step off the holopad and check the ships
     schematics. Try to stay out of sight, I'll be back as soon as I can.

   [Carter disappears.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

   [A Jaffa appears on the viewscreen.]

     OSIRIS
     Report.

     JAFFA3
     The battle with Lord Yu does not go well. We request reinforcements.

     OSIRIS
     That stubborn old man simply refuses to die. Despatch the other
     ships.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Two motherships move off.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

     JAFFA
     Lord Osiris. One of our gliders has detected an energy signature
     located beneath the planet's surface.

     OSIRIS
     Do we have specific co-ordinates?

     JAFFA
     We do. But there is no way in.

     OSIRIS
     Then we'll just have to make our own way, won't we?

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter is looking at the ships schematics.]

     HEIMDALL
     Major Carter, what's your situation?

     CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c are out of their cell. We're working on
     another way to get the shields offline.

   [The facility suddenly shakes.]

     HEIMDALL
     What was that?

     CARTER
     I think the Goa'uld have made my position.

     HEIMDALL
     You should leave immediately.

     CARTER
     Just a few more minutes.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are waiting.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, Carter.

   [Carter appears.]

     CARTER
     I've got it, Sir. Go straight down this corridor and up two levels,
     I'll meet you there.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter comes off the holopad and moves to the console to move some
   crystals. She moves back onto the holopad.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c walk down a corridor and see Carter at the end of
   the corridor.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter.

     CARTER
     There should be an access panel somewhere along here.

     O'NEILL
     Okay, next time, I'm the hologram.

   [They move to the panel and Teal'c pulls the crystal panel out.]

     CARTER
     Okay. Now we just have to pick the right crystal.

     O'NEILL
     Which one?

   [Carter flickers then turns.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     I thought I heard something. There's someone in here.

   [Suddenly Carter is zatted and collapses, disappearing.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Osiris comes into the room and looks at Carter, lying unconscious on
   the floor.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [Four Jaffa come down a corridor. O'Neill kicks one in the face, Teal'c
   disposes of two and O'Neill knocks out the last one. They pick up zat
   guns and staff weapons. O'Neill zats each of the Jaffa once.]

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Carter is brought to her feet before Osiris.]

     OSIRIS
     Major Carter.

     CARTER
     Osiris.

     OSIRIS
     We have Colonel O'Neill and the Shol'va. So that just leaves Doctor
     Jackson. Where is he?

     CARTER
     Forget it.

   [Osiris starts to ribbon Carter.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c look at the crystals.]

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps we should take them all.

     O'NEILL
     Here's a thought.

   [O'Neill takes a step back and fires on the crystals with a staff
   weapon.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

   [Anubis is sitting on the throne.]

     JAFFA
     Shields are down. Controls are offline.

     ANUBIS
     Repair them.

   INT--ASGARD FACILITY

   [Osiris is still ribboning Carter.]

     OSIRIS
     Once more. Where is Doctor Jackson?

     CARTER
     He's dead.

     OSIRIS
     You're lying.

     CARTER
     Go to hell.

   [Osiris raises the ribbon device again but Carter is transported out
   before she can use it.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c are transported out.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c appear in the cargo ship and Teal'c catches
   Carter as she collapses. Thor appears as well, still strapped to the
   table.]

     O'NEILL
     Get us out of here.

     HEIMDALL
     Well done, O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Thanks. Thor, buddy.

   [O'Neill gently shakes Thor, who slowly opens his eyes.]

     THOR
     O'Neill. You cannot take me with you.

     O'NEILL
     Why not?

     THOR
     The link between myself and the Goa'uld ship has not been severed.
     They will be able to track our position. You must leave me behind.

     O'NEILL
     All right, that doesn't work for me. That's not an option for me.
     Okay?

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP--PELTAK

     JAFFA
     Lord Anubis. The Asgard prisoner has gone.

     ANUBIS
     He will not get far.

   [Anubis gestures to a Jaffa, who leaves the room.]

   INT--CARGO SHIP

   [Teal'c is flying the ship up through the atmosphere.]

     CARTER
     We've cleared the atmosphere. Bring up the hyperdrive.

   [The ship is fired upon.]

     TEAL'C
     Hyperdrive is offline. Cloak is failing.

   [The mothership continues firing.]

     TEAL'C
     Cloak is down. We have lost our shields. We cannot sustain another
     hit.

     CARTER
     Sir, we're receiving a transmission.

     ANUBIS
     Your ship is defenceless. You cannot escape. Surrender now.

     O'NEILL

     (to Heimdall)
     Any ideas?

     HEIMDALL
     We cannot risk capture. We must destroy the ship ourselves.

     O'NEILL
     Any good ideas?

   [Suddenly a hyperspace window appears and three Asgard ships appear.]

     CARTER
     We've got company. Three Asgard ships. Sir, I'm picking up a
     transmission to the Goa'uld ship.

     FREYR
     This is Freyr of the Asgard. The vessels you face are far superior
     to the one you attacked. Challenge us at your own peril.

   [Osiris/Anubis' ship moves off.]

     CARTER
     The mothership's retreating. It's over.

     O'NEILL
     That's it?

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter, O'Neill, Teal'c and Hammond are sitting around the table.]

     CARTER
     Their examination of the android must have yielded some positive
     results. Because it looks like the Asgard have finally gained the
     upper hand against the Replicators.

     O'NEILL
     What about Thor?

     CARTER
     They managed to remove the device from his brain but it may have
     been too late. Apparently he's lapsed into a coma. If they knew more
     about how the device works they might be able to help him. They're
     studying it now towards that end. Unfortunately, it's unlike
     anything they've ever encountered before.

     TEAL'C
     It is apparent that Anubis has gained access to technology
     previously unknown to the Goa'uld.

     HAMMOND
     Which would explain his rapid rise to power.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     All right. You're dismissed.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill and Teal'c walk down a corridor in casual clothes.]

     O'NEILL
     We're not that much of a nuisance just yet.

     TEAL'C
     Of that I am not so sure.

   [They meet Carter and Hammond at the elevator.]

     CARTER
     Hey.

     O'NEILL
     Hey.

     CARTER
     Heading home?

     O'NEILL
     Actually, Teal'c and I were thinking of stopping off for a bite to
     eat. Interested?

     CARTER
     Sounds good.

     O'NEILL
     General?

     HAMMOND
     You three go ahead, I've still got some work to do.

   [Suddenly Carter's hair is ruffled by a gust of wind. Teal'c also turns
   towards the breeze.]

     CARTER
     What was that?

   [Hammond turns back to look at SG-1]

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps a malfunction in the ventilation system?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, that's probably it.

     CARTER

     (to Hammond)
     Bye, sir, have a good night.

   [Hammond walks off. Carter walks into the elevator and Teal'c follows.
   Another gust of wind ruffles O'Neill's hair and he turns into the
   elevator, smiling.]
