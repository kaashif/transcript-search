   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate whooshes to life. Within the Gate room, technicians and
   Captain Carter are going through some last minute checks on a UAV
   poised for launch. Carter looks upon it one last time then exits the
   Gate room. Panning to the windows, Colonel O'Neill is watching the
   proceedings along with a technician. Carter joins them at the console.
   Hammond enters the control room.]

     CARTER
     The UAV is a go for launch, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (looking on approvingly)
     Launch.

   [The UAV takes off and flies through the wormhole.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill points at the wormhole, while Carter takes a seat at the
   computer.]

     O'NEILL
     That never gets old. I love that.

     TECHNICIAN
     UAV will arrive at PJ2-445 in three...two...one.

   [O'Neill moves away from the window and goes over to stand behind
   Carter to check the read-out from the UAV on the computer.]

     CARTER
     Automatic Terrain Radar System is functioning. You know, lf this new
     technology works out, Sirs, we'll be able to do more long-range
     reconnaissance.

     O'NEILL
     Cool.

     CARTER
     Sensors are indicating sporadic spots of heat.

   [The display on the monitor show a digital depiction of the topography
   with intermittent red pulsing spots.]

     HAMMOND
     What are they?

     CARTER
     When we were there yesterday, sir, we didn't get this far from the
     Gate. It could be anything. Air vents, warm-water springs...

     O'NEILL
     Perhaps...life forms?

     CARTER
     Motion detectors don't indicate any movement, sir.

   [The picture blinks to static a few times.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Losing signal.

     CARTER
     What? That shouldn't be happening.

   [Carter types in commands on the keyboard.]

     CARTER
     Switching to manual control.

   [Live video feed of the planet's terrain is now seen. Hammond joins
   O'Neill behind Carter. Using joysticks to control the UAV, the video
   shows that the unmanned craft is descending towards a huge white mass
   in the ground.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, Captain. Pull it up.

     CARTER
     I can't, sir.

   [The UAV continues its uncontrolled descent and in a moment, the
   picture turns to static.]

     TECHNICIAN
     We've lost signal. Trying to re-establish.

     CARTER
     This doesn't any make sense. This UAV was specially designed for
     exactly this type of radio control.

     HAMMOND

     (To O'Neill)
     What was that it crashed into?

   [O'Neill merely shrugs.]

     CARTER
     I'm no botanist, sir, but it looked like some sort of plant life.

     TECHNICIAN
     We have visual contact re-established.

   [Carter's monitor shows a stilted camera angle. The white plant is
   laying on its side, a gash is leaking a bright green fluid onto the
   ground.]

     O'NEILL

     (Sheepishly to Hammond)
     Uh, we didn't...need that UAV, did we, sir?

   [Hammond purses his lips, unamused.]

     CARTER
     Uh...I need the flight recorder, sir, to determine why the controls
     failed. Estimated distance from the Gate is 10 miles.

     O'NEILL
     Oy. Six hours there and back.

   [On the monitor, they see a being run across the screen. The three at
   the SGC blink their surprise, when the humanoid being returns and
   kneels down in full view of the camera and studies the fallen UAV.]

     CARTER
     That would confirm the presence of life forms on PJ2-445.

   [Alien #1 stands and moves out of camera range. Next, the video display
   tilts, straighten and begins moving as
   itappearstheUAVisbeingdraggedaway.]

     O'NEILL
     Well...I guess that changes the priority of this mission, eh, sir?

   [Hammond looks at O'Neill for a moment, then nods.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445

   [The Stargate is active and the four members of SG-1 exit the wormhole.
   The Stargate is located in a clearing, short trees dot the landscape
   surrounding the Gate platform. The team look around nd start to move
   down the platform stairs.]

     DANIEL
     Déjà vu.

     TEAL'C
     I am unfamiliar with that term.

     DANIEL
     Um, it means I feel like I've been here before.

     TEAL'C
     That is correct, Daniel Jackson. Yesterday. When we first arrived on
     this planet.

     DANIEL

     (Sheepishly, as his little joke fell flat)
     Right. What was I thinking? Ahchoo!

     O'NEILL
     Bless.

     CARTER
     I'm not picking up the locating beacon on the UAV, but the crash
     site should be this way.

   [Carter starts to head in that direction. The others follow her.]

     DANIEL
     You know, I thought the alien on the video looked fairly
     docile--more curious than harmful.

     O'NEILL
     I thought it looked...bald, white, and naked.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445

   [The team continue to trudge its way to the UAV's last position.]

     TEAL'C
     Since it is their planet, is it not we who are the aliens?

     DANIEL
     The word 'alien' refers to anything characteristic of a very
     different place or culture. Anything really strange relative from
     our own perspective.

     O'NEILL
     Think we call you alien because you're from Chulak? Ha!

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445

   [The damaged plant lies on the ground. It continues to leak the bright
   green fluid. Carter kneels down to take a sample as the team look
   around the area.]

     O'NEILL
     Kinda weird, huh?

   [He notices Carter taking the sample.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain, why don't you start...

     CARTER
     Sir, plant life on Earth accounts for more than 80% of our medicinal
     resources. We should really check it out.

     O'NEILL
     Check it out.

   [Daniel is taking video of a smaller white plant budding close to the
   ground.]

     DANIEL
     These other ones must not be full-grown, I guess. Ah-choo!

     O'NEILL
     Bless.

     DANIEL
     Oh, boy.

   [Daniel reaches into a vest pocket and pulls out a blister pack of
   antihistamines.]

     TEAL'C
     The UAV was dragged in that direction.

   [Teal'c moves off in that direction as O'Neill watches.]

     O'NEILL
     And that direction it is.

   [O'Neill follows Teal'c, just as Carter finishes bagging the sample.
   She joins the team.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445--OUTSIDE ALIEN VILLAGE

   [Viewing structures presumed to be dwellings through binoculars,
   O'Neill scans the village for the aliens. The smaller forms of the
   white plant are scattered near the dwellings.]

     DANIEL
     Dwellings.

     O'NEILL
     Lots of 'em.

   [Carter looks to her left, Alien #1 from the UAV stands up from behind
   a shrub, blinking innocently at them. Carter reaches over and pats
   Daniel, who looks in her direction and sees the little man standing
   there. Slowly, Daniel turns to O'Neill who is still looking through his
   binoculars. Daniel lightly touches O'Neill's arm.]

     DANIEL

     (softly)
     Um, Jack.

     O'NEILL

     (from behind his binoculars)
     Yeah?

   [Daniel pinches O'Neill jacket sleeve and tugs at it, then clears his
   throat when he fails to get his attention. O'Neill lowers his
   binoculars and looks at Daniel, mildly impatient.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [O'Neill sees Alien #1. He brings the binoculars to his eyes and looks
   at it. Alien #1 mimics O'Neill's stance with the binoculars, and
   O'Neill lowers them in mild surprise. Teal'c cocks his head.]

     DANIEL

     (Raising a hand in greeting.)
     Hi.

   [Startled, Alien #1 runs off toward the village, making a strange
   shrieking noise. O'Neill pulls the binoculars up to his eyes again and
   follows the creature's progress towards the village.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

   [Through the binoculars, Alien #1 is seen entering the village still
   emitting the shriek. Other aliens are observed leaving their dwellings
   to see what is wrong.]

     O'NEILL
     What do you think, Daniel? Are they...friendly spirits?

     DANIEL
     I guess we should go find out.

   [The team leave the hill and cross the expanse to the village.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445--ALIEN VILLAGE

   [The aliens anxiously observe the team as it enters the village. They
   are smaller humans with white streaks adorning their nude bodies.
   Carefully, the team walk to the center and cautiously, Daniel raises a
   hand in greeting. They all mimic the hand gesture.]

     DANIEL
     Hello. I'm Daniel Jackson.

   [The aliens including Alien #1 move their mouths in imitation, but do
   not speak. Daniel then smiles easily.]

     DANIEL

     (to the rest of the team)
     Try smiling.

   [Teal'c looks upon the creatures nearest him and smiles stiffly.
   Reluctantly O'Neill half-smiles, as Carter does the same. Again, the
   beings mimic them.]

     O'NEILL
     This is bizarre.

   [The aliens have been standing around, but now they are moving in
   closer, encircling the team.]

     CARTER

     (Alarmed)
     Uh, Daniel...

   [The aliens continue moving forward, their arms outstretched as if
   wanting to touch.]

     DANIEL
     Keep smiling. Don't move.

   [The team are being touched by them. Teal'c, Carter and O'Neill are
   uncomfortable with the touching.]

     TEAL'C
     I am not fond of this.

     O'NEILL
     Me neither.

     DANIEL
     They just wanna see what we feel like.

   [The aliens continue to touch, and a young one pulls Daniel's knife
   from its sheath.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, hey! Wait!

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [Trying not to rile the natives, Daniel smiles easily.]

     DANIEL
     One of them got my knife.

     CARTER
     I got it.

   [Slowly, she moves past them and reaches the boy who is studying the
   knife.]

     CARTER
     Hey, there. Hi. That's not for you. It's very dangerous. Could I
     have it back, please?

   [She gently holds out her hand. Reluctantly, the young one starts to
   return it.]

     DANIEL
     Ah-choo!

   [Stunned by the noise, the boy jerks back, and accidentally cuts
   Carter's hand before dropping it.]

     CARTER
     Agh!

   [The aliens all start back away, fearful.]

     DANIEL
     It...It's just a sneeze.

   [They continue to retreat from them.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, how's your hand?

     CARTER
     It'll be all right, sir.

     TEAL'C
     I have never before encountered such a species.

     DANIEL

     (Taking off his vest)
     I'm going to try and communicate again.

     O'NEILL
     Want some company?

     DANIEL
     I think it'll be less intimidating if I go alone.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Find out what you can about the UAV.

     DANIEL
     OK.

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel heads into one of the dwellings carrying his pack, carefully
   watched by the aliens. A ritual in progress, which he has interrupted;
   young alien being 'painted' in white streaks by someone presumed to be
   a shaman. They all watch Daniel approach. Slowly, Daniel sits on the
   ground near the shaman who watches Daniel closely.]

     DANIEL
     So...

   [The aliens looks at each other, then Daniel points to himself.]

     DANIEL
     Daniel.

   [The shaman mimics the pointing behavior, as does the boy and the
   others standing around. The shaman looks closely at Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     You don't...You don't speak at all, do you?

   [They stare at him.]

     DANIEL
     OK.

   [Daniel starts drawing a stick figure in the loose dirt on the ground.
   The creatures move in closer to see. He finishes.]

     DANIEL
     That's...

   [He points to himself.]

   [The others all start to draw in the dirt, but they are only lines and
   squiggles. In frustration, Daniel takes off his glasses and sighs.
   Suddenly, the shaman raises his finger and paints a line from the tip
   of his nose across his right cheek. The creature dips his finger again
   and runs the paint from Daniel's left cheek to his chin. Puzzled,
   Daniel nods]

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET PJ2-445--OUTSIDE THE DWELLING

   [O'Neill is seated on the ground leaning up against the wall of the
   dwelling, his weapon balanced across his knees. Carter is seated across
   from him and Teal'c is standing nearby. One of the aliens walks by and
   O'Neill half waves to it but it ignored. He casts an eye at Carter who
   merely shrugs.]

     O'NEILL
     You got to wonder what they're talking about in there.

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel is jogging around the perimeter of the room, arms outstretched
   and making motor sounds in imitation of the UAV. The aliens all watch
   him as he slows to a halt and finally stops. He gazes at them to see if
   there is any recognition, but the aliens look at each other then back
   at Daniel.]

   EXT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel walks out of the dwelling and joins his companions.]

     DANIEL
     Well, they're not naked. They're covered with something.

   [He sits down next to O'Neill and rubs at the paint on his face.]

     DANIEL
     Look, it's, uh, it's some sort of body paint that hardens into a
     second skin when it dries. Well, I have to admit this is one of the
     stranger cultures I've ever seen. As far as I can tell, they're
     communal, but there's very little sign of actual of social
     communication. I haven't seen any tools or signs of a functional
     civilization.

     O'NEILL
     So they're a little less evolved than we are.

     DANIEL
     Well, we don't wanna jump to any conclusions. Remember the Nox.

     CARTER

     (Nodding)
     And they did build these...homes.

     O'NEILL
     That's a kind appraisal.

   [One of the aliens steps out of the dwelling and looks at them.]

     O'NEILL
     What about the UAV?

   [Daniel watches the aliens file out of the dwelling]

     DANIEL
     Well, I've tried everything I know about rudimentary communication.
     And, to be honest, I've had more successful conversations with dogs.

   [O'Neill cocks his head at Daniel and holds out his hands]

     O'NEILL
     So...

     DANIEL

     (Conceding)
     So they're probably a little less evolved than we are.

   [O'Neill looks past Teal'c and sees the aliens hauling the UAV to where
   they are, and the team rise to their feet and go to where they set it
   down on the ground.]

     DANIEL

     (Excitedly smiling)
     Yes!

   [Alien #1 stretches his arms out.]

     DANIEL
     Yes! The...the...the...the...

   [Daniel briefly raises his arms to his side again.]

     DANIEL
     Yes! Thank you. This...

   [One of the aliens who'd been carrying the UAV is rubbing at a black
   residue on his hand.]

     DANIEL
     This is a major breakthrough. Ah choo!

   [Aliens are startled again by the sneeze.]

     DANIEL
     I'm sorry. This is, uh...This is nothing to worry about.

   [The alien with the black residue on his hand suddenly collapses. SG-1
   look at each other and Carter goes over to the alien and feels for a
   pulse.]

     DANIEL

     (Worried)
     Of course, I could be wrong.

     CARTER
     I can't find a pulse, but I don't know if that means anything. He's
     still breathing.

   [O'Neill warily eyes the aliens who've gathered around them]

     O'NEILL
     Captain, why don't we back off for now, huh?

     DANIEL
     I really hope this isn't because I sneezed on him.

     TEAL'C
     This one appeared to have lubricant from the UAV on his hands.
     Perhaps that is what has made him ill.

     O'NEILL
     Could be their national pastime for all we know. Maybe they got low
     blood sug...

   [The aliens look up, eyes closed, and suddenly begin singing a strange
   chord.]

     CARTER
     They're singing.

     O'NEILL
     Is that what that is?

     DANIEL

     (Looking around at them)
     Some...Native American as well as African and Aboriginal tribes
     believe that music and chants have medicinal powers.

     CARTER
     The sound is incredible.

   [Another alien falls to its knees, then topples over.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I guess it didn't work quite like they hoped.

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel and Carter are observing as the aliens are trying to care for
   one of their fallen. Teal'c carries in the other with O'Neill following
   him in. The healthier aliens help Teal'c to set the alien on the ground
   O'Neill looks on.]

     TEAL'C
     O'Neill, should we not leave now?

     DANIEL

     (Looks at Teal'c)
     What?

     TEAL'C
     Our presence here may make more of them ill.

     CARTER
     I was wondering the same thing, Daniel. What if we're causing this?

     DANIEL
     Well, look at them. I don't think they know what's happening, much
     less how to help themselves.

     O'NEILL
     Hey, we don't even know what's happening, much less how to help
     them.

   [Another alien collapses.]

     DANIEL
     Well, whatever it is, it's turning into an epidemic.

   EXT--STARGATE--PLANET PJ2-445

   [The wormhole is active, and three members of the SGC appear in
   biohazard gear and holding equipment. O'Neill and Teal'c are waiting at
   the DHD.]

     FRAISER

     (From inside her suit)
     Now, this is a house call. Let's go.

     O'NEILL
     Straightaway, boys.

   [The medical team follow O'Neill and Teal'c.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Aliens observer the new arrivals as Dr. Fraiser and her team enter the
   village. Carter is there to greet them.]

     FRAISER
     Captain Carter.

     CARTER
     Dr Fraiser.

     FRAISER
     What's the situation?

     CARTER
     We're up to 14 afflicted. They seem to just double over in pain and
     pass out. From there, they remain unconscious.

   [Frasier follows Carter into the dwelling.]

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel is standing there, hands in pockets.]

     CARTER
     We've introduced a number of foreign substances that could be
     responsible.

   [The rest of SG-1 enter.]

     FRAISER
     OK. Let's set up over here.

     O'NEILL
     And the UAV ran into that...plant thing I showed you.

     DANIEL
     I've been sneezing like crazy ever since we got here.

     CARTER
     Yeah, and I cut my hand, and one of the aliens could have come in
     contact with my blood.

     TEAL'C
     One of the aliens had lubricant from the UAV on his hands.

     FRAISER

     (Rising up from her medical equipment)
     OK, look. The fact is, it could be somebody's aftershave. Now, how
     are they going to react if I want to run some tests?

     DANIEL
     The behavior of the group indicates serious agitation and concern.
     This is obviously unusual to them. They're worried, but so far,
     they've been very passive and willing to let us try to help.

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Frasier exits the dwelling and approaches SG-1. The team is standing
   except for O'Neill who is squatting on the ground.]

     FRAISER
     Your tests are all clean.

     DANIEL
     What about them?

     FRAISER
     I'm pretty limited here. I mean, they may look similar to us, but
     they are definitely very different.

     O'NEILL

     (Knowingly)
     You don't know what's wrong, do you?

     FRAISER
     No. I recommend we take one of them back to Earth where I can run
     more extensive tests. Under Level 2 quarantine conditions, it should
     be perfectly safe.

     DANIEL

     (To O'Neill)
     I'd like to stay.

     O'NEILL
     What for?

     DANIEL
     Keep trying to communicate with them. Reassure them we're trying to
     help.

     FRAISER
     I don't see any danger, sir.

     O'NEILL
     We're not making things worse by being here?

     FRAISER
     No, I think the damage is probably already done. Quarantine the
     sick, in case this problem is contagious amongst them. I also
     suggest you check out the other villages in the distance. If this
     illness is present there, it just may rule us out as the origin.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Carter, you go back with Frasier. Report to General Hammond,
     and get your hand looked at. Daniel, Teal'c, and I'll stick around.

   EXT--PLANET PJ2-445 STARGATE

   [Carter is dialing the Stargate, and Frasier is next to her. One of the
   aliens is on a stretcher, which is being lifted by Frasier's med team.
   The rest of SG-1 and two of the healthy aliens, including Alien #1,
   look on. The healthy aliens pat the sick one on the stretcher. They
   watch worriedly as their friend is being taken away.]

     DANIEL
     It's OK.

   [The med team, Carter and Frasier disappear into the wormhole.]

     DANIEL
     Everything's going to be fine.

   [The shaman and the other alien are still worried, as is O'Neill.
   Daniel tries to smile reassuringly.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [The afflicted alien lies awake as his gurney is carted through the
   hallways. He is agitated. Frasier places a resuscitation bag over his
   nose and mouth as she and Carter escort the gurney through the halls
   and into the isolation room.]

     MEDIC
     On three.

   [They lift the backboard and transfer it to the table.]

     CARTER
     All right. You're going to be OK.

     FRAISER
     Get this out of here.

   [The medics remove the gurney from the room.]

     FRAISER
     It's OK.

   [Nurses gather around, one of them checks the alien's eyes. To the
   nurse.]

     FRAISER
     Give me your stethoscope when you're done.

   [The alien reaches for Carter's arm and holds onto it.]

     CARTER
     When he first got sick, they all gathered around him and started
     making this incredible sound. It was like music.

   [The alien wheezes as he loosens his grasp of Carter's arm. They
   continue to assess his condition.]

   EXT -PLANET PJ2-445--SUNRISE

   [Cut to Teal'c and O'Neill walking along from presumably other
   villages.]

     TEAL'C
     Do you not believe we are responsible, O'Neill?

     O'NEILL
     Yes, I believe we are...not. We should check it out either way.

     TEAL'C
     It is possible an alien went to warn others and spread the disease.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I guess.

   [O'Neill's legs buckle and he falls to the ground.]

     O'NEILL
     Whoa! Whoa!

   [Teal'c grabs his arm and tries to help him. O'Neill pulls his arm from
   Teal'c's hold.]

     O'NEILL
     I got it.

     TEAL'C

     (Alarmed)
     Are you all right, O'Neill?

     O'NEILL

     (Getting to his feet)
     I'm fine. Look...Teal'c, I know this might be tough for you, but
     would...would you mind if we just walked without talking for a
     while?

     TEAL'C
     Do you feel an illness?

     O'NEILL
     A little headache. I'll be fine.

   [He resumes walking under Teal'c's watchful eye.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY--ISOLATION ROOM

   [The alien is hooked to monitors and Frasier (in scrubs)
   is working with some equipment as Carter walks in wearing a surgical
   gown.]

     CARTER
     How's it going?

     FRAISER
     Nothing conclusive yet. I'm just about to do an ultrasound to see if
     I can get a clear picture of their internal organs.

   [The alien awakens. Janet turns on the ultrasound machine and the alien
   suddenly emits a high-pitched shrieking. Fraiser and Carter look on
   alarmed. Carter is stroking the distressed alien's head.]

     FRAISER
     Maybe I'll try another way.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY--MRI ROOM

   [The alien is lying on the table as the machine rolls his body into the
   MRI. He watches warily.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY--OBSERVATION ROOM OVERLOOKING MRI

   [Fraiser is at a computer while Carter stands watching the alien's
   progress through the window.]

     FRAISER
     There are a number of common elements in their blood -- red and
     white cells, glucose, protein.

     CARTER
     But you're working with a human frame of reference on the test
     results.

     FRAISER
     Exactly. How am I supposed to know what's normal for these guys?

   [The computer monitor beeps and pulsates. A red mass is seen in the
   abdominal area of the scanned 3-D image. It appears to be a heart. The
   image turns on screen.]

     CARTER
     Uh...That's not exactly normal, is it?

     FRAISER
     Not from any anatomy I've learned. Look at this.

   [They both stare at the image, fascinated.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel moves from room to room in the alien's dwelling and looks in on
   the sick aliens as they are watched over by the others. Concerned, he
   walks out.]

   EXT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel walks out of the dwelling and comes across Alien #1. One of the
   white plants has grown tall, then suddenly it shrinks back into the
   ground, only its mushroom-like caps remain on the surface. Daniel is
   stunned.]

     DANIEL
     Whoa!

   [He walks over to Alien #1 standing next to the plant, pointing.]

     DANIEL
     What...uh...what...What just happened?

   [The alien squats down, showing Daniel.]

     DANIEL
     Right.

   [Daniel gives him a thumbs-up as O'Neill and Teal'c walk up to them.]

     DANIEL
     Good impression.

     O'NEILL
     What's up?

     DANIEL
     Uh, the plant. Or, at least, it was.

     O'NEILL
     What?

     DANIEL

     Well, i-it had grown to over six feet tall, and when I came up to
     it, it just shrank back down into the ground.
     (O'Neill looks at him)
     I'm going to back up again, see if it does it again.

   [Daniel backs up and looks at the plant as does the alien. O'Neill
   looks at Daniel as if he's gone crazy. The plant does nothing.]

     O'NEILL

     (Sarcastically)
     Witness if you will...squat.

     DANIEL

     Well, you...
     (pointing to Alien #1)
     ...you saw it, too.
     (the alien squats down again)
     See? Just...like that.

     TEAL'C
     Many aliens in nearby villages are ill.

     DANIEL
     OK...

   [Putting his hands on his head, he takes a deep breath through gritted
   teeth.]

     DANIEL
     What are we going to do?

     O'NEILL
     How should I know?

     DANIEL
     Well, we need to do something.

     O'NEILL
     I agree with you. But I haven't had the brilliant revelations you
     seem to have had.

     DANIEL

     (Looking at O'Neill)
     Maybe you could try something a little bit better than inappropriate
     sarcasm.

     O'NEILL
     You want sarcasm? Nice to meet you.

   [Alien #1 walks up to O'Neill smiling, then turns to Daniel smiling.]

     O'NEILL
     What's he smiling at?

     TEAL'C

     He appears to be bothered by the tone you have taken towards each
     other.
     (O'Neill and Daniel look at each other)
     As am I.

   [Alien #1 stops smiling.]

     O'NEILL
     Uh, Teal'c...go head back to the Gate. Get a message to General
     Hammond. Let him know what's going on here.

     TEAL'C
     And the two of you will be fine?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Yeah. We'll be OK. I'm going to stick around and work on this
     quarantine thing with Plant Boy here.

   [Daniel gives him a look. Teal'c also fixes O'Neill with a stare, to
   which O'Neill seemingly can't find the words to explain why he'd said
   what he just said. Daniel nods imperceptibly, but there's a questioning
   look on his face.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION

   [Carter is patting the alien's arm like the others had, while Frasier
   is in the observation room overlooking the isolation room. Hammond
   enters the observation room. Carter leaves the alien's side and heads
   for observation.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Frasier looks out over the patient as Carter enters.]

     HAMMOND
     We just got a report from Teal'c. The sick now number over a
     hundred, that's only among the aliens that they could count. The
     disease does not appear to be local to the village you encountered.

     FRAISER
     The muscle that I've identified as the alien's heart is beating more
     and more erratically.

     HAMMOND
     So whatever he's got is going to kill him?

     FRAISER
     I don't know how much longer I can keep this one alive, sir. I'm
     afraid to administer drugs because it could make him worse.

     CARTER
     Sir, if you don't mind, what are you thinking?

     HAMMOND
     Captain, I am thinking that the unfortunate reality is that this
     scenario was not totally unexpected.

     FRAISER
     Actually, sir, the surprising thing is it hasn't happened more
     often. We think it may be because there are so many transplanted
     humans from Earth on other planets that most of the contagions we
     carry are already out there.

     CARTER
     Yeah, well, not in this case.

     HAMMOND
     Unfortunately, there's only so much time and so many resources that
     this facility can devote to this situation.

     FRAISER
     Sir, I didn't say it was hopeless.

     CARTER
     They didn't ask for this. They're clearly unable to help themselves.
     We just can't keep trampling through the galaxy with no regard for
     the damage that we can do.

     FRAISER
     Sir, we need more time.

     CARTER
     A lot more time.

     HAMMOND

     (Moving closer)
     How much time you've got is not up to me.

     CARTER
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     You said it yourself, doctor. They are dying.

   [They all look upon the alien lying in the bed below.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   EXT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel is working with his video camera as O'Neill is in the dwelling
   with the aliens.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah-ah-ah. Get back. Come on. Get back.

   [The aliens are running out of the dwelling, not heeding O'Neill.]

     O'NEILL
     Fine. Knock yourself out. Go ahead. Go play in the street. Don't
     forget your sunblock.

   [He walks out of the dwelling and up to Daniel.]

     O'NEILL

     (Irritably)
     Why aren't you helping me?

     DANIEL
     It's no use. They don't understand. They want to be with each other.

     O'NEILL
     Well, we're not going to stand around doing nothing.

     DANIEL
     We're not doing nothing.

     O'NEILL
     You're videotaping a plant.

     DANIEL
     Well, I think this might be important.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I think you might be losing what's left of your mind.

     DANIEL
     What's that supposed to mean?

     O'NEILL
     It means that on a good day you can be a little flaky.

     DANIEL
     And on a good day you can be a little ignorant and condescending.

     O'NEILL
     Not condescending. You're obviously misreading a basic philosophical
     difference of opinion on how to handle a crisis.

     DANIEL
     Oh, please! We have a difference of opinion on just about
     everything.

     O'NEILL
     Give me an example.

     DANIEL
     I don't know. Pick something. How about mythology?

     O'NEILL
     Rumors? Lies? Fairytales?

     DANIEL
     You see?

   [Daniel spins around bouncing animatedly waving his hands.]

     DANIEL
     See? See? See? See? See?

   [Alien #1 toddles up to them, as Daniel starts yelling.]

     DANIEL
     Mythology is one of the primary motivation for cultural development!

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     Maybe it is, what's that got to do with filming a plant?!

     DANIEL

     (yelling)
     Exactly!

     O'NEILL

     (yelling)
     What does that mean?!

     DANIEL

     (yelling)
     I don't know!

   [Alien #1 looks from O'Neill to Daniel and back, blinking his
   confusion. O'Neill seems to realize they have crossed the line.]

     O'NEILL

     (More quietly)
     OK...what was that?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. I don't feel so good.

     O'NEILL

     (Holding his neck)
     I've got a headache.

     DANIEL
     Maybe we're getting whatever they have.

   [They both watch Alien #1 pass out. Daniel crouches over him.]

   INT--ALIEN DWELLING--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel and O'Neill are carrying Alien #1 into the dwelling. They lay
   him down gently as the others appear to help. O'Neill and Daniel sit
   down, exhausted, and O'Neill clutches his neck. Daniel observes this.]

     DANIEL
     Getting worse?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Kinda.

   [Daniel nods, and Teal'c walks in observing them closely, then the
   afflicted aliens.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     Dr Frasier and Captain Carter have had little success in healing the
     alien.

     O'NEILL

     (Looking at Daniel)
     Well, I think Daniel and I are coming down with something, too.
     (To Teal'c)
     How are you doing?

     TEAL'C
     I remain unaffected.

     O'NEILL

     (To Daniel)
     I think we should probably go back and get checked out, huh?

   [Daniel doesn't answer.]

     TEAL'C
     I will remain.

   [O'Neill nods.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Daniel exits the dwelling, followed by O'Neill then Teal'c.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, Teal'c. If we're not back in twelve hours, come on home.

   [Daniel sets his pack down. He kneels over the video camera, which has
   been set up to observe the plant.]

     DANIEL

     (To Teal'c)
     Would you do me a favour?

   [He slides a fresh tape in the camera.]

     DANIEL

     (To Teal'c)
     Could you keep an eye on this plant thing for me?

     TEAL'C
     I will keep both of my eyes on it, Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     Thank you.

   [Daniel rises and walks over to O'Neill. They start walking to the
   Stargate, and O'Neill notices that Daniel's gait is a little off.]

     O'NEILL
     Are you going to make this?

   [Daniel stops, turns to look back at the village. O'Neill pats him on
   the shoulder, encouragingly.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on.

   [They resume walking.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Klaxons sound as Hammond and Carter enter the Gate room. Daniel and
   O'Neill exit the wormhole a bit unsteadily.]

     CARTER
     Are you OK?

     DANIEL
     We started to feel sick.

     CARTER
     What kind of sick?

     O'NEILL
     Headaches. Brutal headaches.

     DANIEL
     But now I feel fine.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, are you okay?

     O'NEILL
     I'm feeling better, actually.

   [Daniel looks at O'Neill, who returns his puzzled gaze. Carter and
   Hammond exchange glances.]

   the floor.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen. I, uh...

     DANIEL
     No, no. Um...Sorry. You were going to say?

     O'NEILL
     No, it's just that, uh...Well...You know.

     DANIEL
     No, I know. I know. You know that I...

     O'NEILL
     I know. It's obvious there's something...

     DANIEL
     ...wrong with us.

     DANIEL/O'NEILL

     (together)
     Physically.

   [Frasier walks in cheerily.]

     FRAISER
     Well, there's nothing wrong with you.

     DANIEL
     What?

     FRAISER
     I've run every test, short of exploratory brain surgery, and you are
     both in perfect health.

     O'NEILL

     (Pondering, then...)
     Huh.

   [Frasier rushes off, leaving the two men to sit awkwardly.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Frasier rushes into the room. Carter is there with nurses who are
   trying to resuscitate him. One is bagging him, while the other does
   check compressions. The heart monitor is sounding.]

     CARTER
     He's flatlining!

     FRAISER

     (Running around the bed)
     Normally, I'd defibrillate, but I don't know what it'll do in this
     case. One milligram epinephrine. Start a lidocaine IV. Go!

   [Frasier takes over chest compressions, while the nurse runs off to
   fill the orders.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Teal'c is standing outside one of the dwellings. Behind him, one of
   the plants begins to grow. Then two more grow. He looks at them, and
   when he tries to move closer to touch one of them, it shrinks from him.
   He takes a step to the other two, and they shrink. Teal'c stands there
   curious. Kneeling, he takes out his knife and scrapes at the surface of
   the soil. A white root system is exposed and when he digs his hands
   into the soil, he touches a bright green substance. Suddenly, Teal'c
   gasps in pain. Clutching his head, he lies down on the ground, grunting
   in pain, the green liquid still on his fingers. He loses
   consciousness.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION--OBSERVATIOIN ROOM

   [O'Neill and Daniel are watching Janet minister to the alien as Carter
   walks in, still wearing surgical scrubs.]

     CARTER
     He's stable for now.

     DANIEL

     (Quietly)
     If he's going to die, shouldn't we at least let him be with his own
     kind?

   [O'Neill looks at him, sympathetically, as does Carter. Daniel then
   leaves the room, O'Neill watches him.]

   INT--SGC--DANIEL'S LAB

   [O'Neill enters the room. Daniel is watching the original videotape of
   the plant that had been hit by the UAV.]

     O'NEILL
     What are you looking for?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. Something. Anything.

   [He drops the remote in disgust, gets up from his desk and goes over to
   his table looking through a set of mini tapes. O'Neill watches him,
   concerned.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel, we can't always expect things to go the way we want them to.

   [Daniel stops what he's doing and glares at O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     To go the way we want them to? I mean, one wrong move, one false
     step, and a whole fragile world gets wiped out?

   [Angrily, Daniel shoves all his papers off the lab table and shouts.]

     DANIEL
     We are killing a whole race of people here! How can I not care?!

   [Daniel stops and stares off.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [Daniel closes his eyes and sighs.]

     DANIEL
     My head hurts again.

   [Daniel walks out of his lab, leaving O'Neill standing there. O'Neill
   then follows him.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Frasier shines a penlight in Daniel's eyes, as O'Neill and Carter look
   on.]

     FRAISER
     Well, your pupils look fine.

     DANIEL
     This is the strangest thing. I feel fine again.

     FRAISER
     OK. So, then, when did this start?

     DANIEL
     Well, it was probably while I was watching...

   [He looks at Frasier. After a beat, she shakes her head puzzled.]

     DANIEL
     Excuse me.

   [He leaves the infirmary passing O'Neill and Carter at the door.
   Frasier shrugs.]

   INT--SGC--DANIEL'S LAB

   [Daniel walks in to his lab, putting his glasses back on. O'Neill and
   Carter follow him in.]

     DANIEL
     There has to be something the camera recorded. Something we can't
     see.

   [Daniel hits the remote again, and the monitor displays the plant
   footage again.]

     CARTER
     Or hear.

   [Daniel looks at her.]

     CARTER
     Give me the tape.

   [Daniel hands her the tape and she leaves his lab. Daniel follows her,
   and O'Neill follows Daniel.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter heads up the stairs. Dr. Frasier is there, with Daniel and
   O'Neill on their heels. Carter sits down at a computer as the others
   gather around her, and she inserts the videotape.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, what are you doing?

     CARTER
     I'm looking for something that we can't hear.

   [She enters a command. The monitor displays an audio spectrum analysis
   being performed.]

     CARTER
     Here. In the long-amplitude waves. Isolating and amplifying.

   [A low droning can be heard now, as the readout spike in the red zone.
   O'Neill grimaces.]

     CARTER
     See? This was under everything you recorded with the camera. The
     sound was present the entire time we were on the planet. We just
     couldn't hear it.

     O'NEILL

     (Over the noise)
     It's kind of annoying.

   [Absently, Carter nods.]

     O'NEILL
     Why don't you turn it down?

   [Carter turns down the volume.]

     FRAISER
     Actually, it's more than annoying, sir. It's also responsible for
     the symptoms you were describing.

     DANIEL
     It is?

     FRAISER
     Long-term exposure to certain sounds have been documented to cause
     serious physical side effects: your headaches, nausea, severe
     irritability. The longer you're exposed to it, the worse it gets.

     CARTER
     I'll bet this is what was interfering with our remote control on the
     UAV.

     DANIEL
     So this is what's making the aliens sick?

     FRAISER
     No. See, you felt better when you got back here, but the alien we
     brought here just keeps getting worse.

     CARTER
     And the sound that was causing your symptoms isn't here on the base.
     Except on this tape.

     DANIEL
     So this isn't what's making the aliens sick?

   [Klaxons begin sounding.]

   Frasier.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The iris opens, and O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Frasier enter the Gate
   room. SFs take up positions as they wait for Teal'c. Moments later,
   Teal'c comes through, staggering. All rush up the ramp to assist him.
   They help him down the ramp.]

     O'NEILL
     You all right?

     TEAL'C
     My condition is improving.

     O'NEILL
     Sit down.

   [Teal'c sits at the base of the ramp, and Frasier examines him. The
   others gather around.]

     DANIEL
     Well, I guess Jaffa aren't completely impervious after all.

     TEAL'C
     What has led you to that assumption?

     O'NEILL
     Well, there's...some kind of bad sound on that planet.

     DANIEL
     It's what made us sick. I guess it just took you a little longer to
     cave in.

     TEAL'C
     I believe it to be the organism that was somehow attacking me.

     CARTER
     What organism?

     TEAL'C
     I made a discovery while observing your plants, Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL
     You saw them grow?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. I saw several of them rise. When I approached, they
     retracted into the ground. I removed the dirt from around the
     retracted plants. It appears they are all connected.

     CARTER
     And you say it attacked you?

     TEAL'C
     As I drew near the organism, I became disoriented. My head was
     overcome with great pain. Movement became very difficult.

     DANIEL

     (comprehending)
     That's it.

   [Daniel starts to leave the Gate room.]

     O'NEILL
     What? Where are you going?

   [Daniel turns back and walks in the room again.]

     DANIEL

     (Distractedly)
     Come on.

   [The team look at him, puzzled. They then follow him.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel hustles into the room. O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Frasier join
   him at the main console where the technician is seated.]

     DANIEL
     Did we record audio from the UAV's air run over PJ2-445?

     TECHNICIAN
     Sure.

     DANIEL
     Do you have a tape?

     TECHNICIAN
     It's still in the hard-drive data bank.

     CARTER

     Okay. Run it though an audio spectrum analysis, amplify the low end
     and replay it though the speakers.
     (To Daniel)
     I think I know where you're going.

   [The monitor displays the analysis of the sound, with low spikes
   showing on the meter.]

     DANIEL
     Now, fast-forward to after the UAV crashed.

   [The technician fast-forwards and there is a change in the sound.]

     DANIEL
     When the UAV crashed on the plant, the sound changed.

   [Carter nods her agreement.]

     O'NEILL

     (Incredulous)
     The plant is making that sound?

     CARTER
     Sir, it's an alien organism on another planet.

     O'NEILL
     Good point.

     DANIEL
     We accidentally changed the sound the organism naturally makes.

     TEAL'C
     Why would the sound change?

     DANIEL
     It's alive. We...hurt it.

     CARTER
     Maybe the aliens are affected by the sound in totally different ways
     than you were. They could need the sound to be at a certain
     frequency.

     TEAL'C
     For what reason?

     CARTER
     To live. They don't even have the same internal organs that we do.

     FRAISER
     The ultrasound. Do you remember the way the alien reacted when I
     tried to do the ultrasound? That organ that we couldn't identify
     must be sound-sensitive.

   [Carter nods.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY--ISOLATION

   [Daniel inserts the videotape into the player. It is hooked up to
   speakers. He presses the play button. Hammond is in the observation
   room along with O'Neill and Teal'c.]

     HAMMOND
     So this inaudible sound made you sick, but not in the same way it
     was affecting the aliens? They need the sound to live, but we
     altered it by harming the organism that makes the sound?

     O'NEILL

     (uncertain)
     Sounds right.

   [Hammond frowns at O'Neill. Daniel goes over to the alien's bed and
   stands next to Carter. Frasier is on the other side of the bed.]

     FRAISER
     His pulse is getting stronger.

   [The alien opens his mouth and emits a high tone. He wakes and sees
   Fraiser and Daniel smile at him. He returns the smile.]

   EXT--ALIEN VILLAGE--PLANET PJ2-445

   [Carter is working on solar-powered panels, while O'Neill watches her
   progress.]

     CARTER
     Frequency emitters are operational, sir.

   [Carter rises from her position and goes over to see Daniel, who is
   with the aliens.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, we should, uh, we should get out of here.

     DANIEL

     (Reluctant)
     Well, don't you wanna stay and see if it works?

     CARTER
     Yeah, but we can watch from the ridge over there. I have a hunch,
     and I think we might be in the way.

   [Daniel looks at her, then back at the aliens. She looks meaningfully
   at Daniel, then she and O'Neill move off leaving Daniel with the
   aliens.]

     DANIEL

     (Raising his hand)
     Goodbye.

   [Alien #1 and another alien raise their hands, too. And Daniel joins
   Teal'c as they follow O'Neill and Carter. Daniel and Teal'c both turn
   back, raising their hands. Again, the aliens return the gesture.
   Watching from the ridge, SG-1 stand and wait. Teal'c is watching
   through binoculars.]

     DANIEL

     (To Carter)
     How much longer, do you think?

     CARTER
     I don't know.

     O'NEILL
     Care to let us in on this hunch?

     CARTER
     Not yet, sir.

   [Viewing the village from the ridge, they see the aliens moving out
   among the dwellings, the aliens begin singing.]

     TEAL'C
     There.

   [He tosses the binoculars to O'Neill, who deftly catches it.]

     TEAL'C
     The plants are growing.

   [Daniel looks on, and O'Neill puts the binoculars to his eyes. Through
   the lenses, he sees the plants start growing.]

     DANIEL

     (To Carter, curiously)
     That was your hunch?

     CARTER
     I had a feeling there was some sort of symbiotic relationship
     between the aliens and the organism. They probably don't even
     realise it.

     DANIEL
     Well, how did you realise it?

   [Carter opens her mouth, but doesn't say anything.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain?

   [Carter glances around nervously.]

     CARTER
     I...I talk to my plants, OK?

   [The team just look at her, but say nothing. Across the expanse, the
   plants are growing everywhere, bright pink blossoms bursting open at
   the tops.]

   FADE OUT
