   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [View from the Stargate. Two technicians are discussing something on
   the ramp. The activation klaxon begins to sound, and they turn to run
   off the ramp.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Unauthorised incoming traveller!

     VOICE
     Clear the ramp!

   [SF's rush into the room and deploy around the base of it, aiming their
   weapons at the Gate. Camera view moves through soldiers and then up to
   the control room as Hammond rushes in. SG-1 members stream in to stand
   just behind him.]

     HAMMOND
     Who is it?

     TECHNICIAN
     No idea, sir. SG-5 and SG-14 are out, but neither are due unitl
     tomorrow.

     HAMMOND
     No iris code?

     TECHNICIAN
     No, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I did not give the order to open the iris, mister!

     TECHNICIAN
     I did not open it, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Well, close it!

   [The iris closes, but then immediately opens again.]

     HAMMOND
     Get that iris closed, Sergeant!

     TECHNICIAN
     I'm trying, but the computer keeps overriding it.

   [A set of legs and feet are shown exiting the wormhole. They are
   clothed in fuzzy brown fabric.]

     DANIEL

     (getting Hammond's attention)
     General.

   [Hammond looks up at the Gate. The camera pans up the side of the body
   of the person standing at the top of the ramp. The person's head is
   covered by a hood that obscures the face from the side. Hammond and
   SG-1 move to leave the control room.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The visitor removes his hood, revealing he is a young boy, perhaps 10
   years old. He looks around the Gate room, giving a small smile. In a
   cameo, PDL peers at him from behind a metal shield. The boy walks to
   the bottom of the ramp, meeting Hammond and SG-1.]

     HAMMOND
     Search him.

     O'NEILL

     General?
     (holding up a hand)
     If I...may suggest...allowing Carter to do it. She can detect other
     stuff.

   [Hammond nods, and Carter approaches the boy.]

     CARTER
     Hello. What's your name? Okay. My name is Sam. I have to check you
     for...for things you probably know nothing about. But just in
     case...

   [Carter touches the boy's head and ears while he stands by passively.
   She stands to address the others.]

     CARTER
     Well, he's not Goa'uld or Jaffa. I can't sense any naquadah. As far
     as I can tell he's clean.

     O'NEILL
     What's he doing here?

     BOY
     I am here to warn you.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAYTIME

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [The boy is sitting on an infirmary bed. Fraiser, Carter, Hammond, and
   O'Neill are there.]

     FRAISER
     Well, as far as I can tell, he's human.

     O'NEILL
     No bomb in the chest? Little biohazard in the tooth, maybe?

     FRAISER
     Checked for both. He's no threat to us, as far as I'm able to tell,
     but he's pretty weak. I'm guessing he's malnourished.

     CARTER
     What's your name?

     BOY

     (looking around Carter to see O'Neill)
     Your name is Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     How'd you know that?

     BOY
     My mother told me.

   [He points at something beyond Fraiser, and they all turn to look.
   There is only an empty bed in the corner.]

     O'NEILL
     Your mother?

     BOY

     (apparently listening to someone)
     Yes. She says I am to speak only with you.

     O'NEILL
     Well, these people are my friends. You can trust them.

     BOY

     (turning to look in the corner, then back at O'Neill)
     Mother says to speak only to you.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Why me?

     BOY
     Because mother has observed you and determined she likes you. You
     are one who can be trusted.

     O'NEILL

     (to the room in general)
     Well thank you, ma'am. How long have you been watching me?

     BOY
     For many weeks.

     O'NEILL
     Weeks?

     BOY

     Yes. She first saw you on another planet, and she followed your team
     through the Stargate at that time. She observed you all until your
     team returned with the one called...
     (looks toward empty area)
     ...Tonane. Based on your actions at that time, Mother believes you
     are the only honorable leader among your people. It was only your
     team who did not want to steal Tonane's mineral.

     O'NEILL
     Then why not trust the rest of my team?

     BOY
     Because you are the leader. Mother insists I speak no further unless
     it is with you...alone.

     HAMMOND
     Let's step into the corridor for a few moments, folks.

   [Everyone leaves except for O'Neill and the boy.]

     O'NEILL
     So what do I call you?

     BOY
     I do not have a name.

     O'NEILL
     What's your mom call you?

     BOY
     Son.

     O'NEILL
     It's not much of a name.

     BOY
     No. it's more of a description.

     O'NEILL

     (smiling)
     Yes, it is.

     BOY
     Mother says you too have a son.

     O'NEILL

     (softly)
     I had one. He's gone now.

     BOY
     What was his name?

     O'NEILL
     Charlie.

     BOY
     Charlie. I like Charlie. it's a good name. Can I be called Charlie?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Sure. lf that's what you want.

     CHARLIE
     Okay, Colonel O'Neill, I'm Charlie.

     O'NEILL

     (reaching out his hand)
     Hi, Charlie.
     (they shake hands)
     Call me Jack.

     CHARLIE
     Jack.

   [O'Neill moves to sit next to Charlie on the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     So where are you from?

     CHARLIE
     A planet called Reetalia.

     O'NEILL
     Nice place?

     CHARLIE
     Used to be, until most of the Reetou were destroyed by mean
     creatures with glowing eyes.

     O'NEILL
     Well that's the Goa'uld. I'm sorry to hear that.

     CHARLIE
     That's why I'm here...to warn you.

     O'NEILL
     Well, thank you, Charlie, but we already knew about the Goa'uld.

     CHARLIE
     Not the Goa'uld. It's the Reetou rebels who intend to eliminate you.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [SG-1, Hammond, and Fraiser are in the room.]

     CARTER
     We did a Level One analysis on the iris mechanism. It behaved as if
     control was being commandeered from the main computer by an
     override. Like it was being controlled from another keyboard
     somewhere. We have software specialists picking it apart right now.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill, any more insight into the boy?

     O'NEILL
     The best I can tell, sir, the kid survived a Goa'uld massacre.

     FRAISER
     Well that would explain Mom. See, it would be a natural
     psychological defense mechanism. He's convinced himself that she
     never left him. That her spirit,' for lack of a better word, is
     always with him.

     DANIEL
     Well, how did he know about the Salish?

     O'NEILL
     How did he know about my kid?

     DANIEL
     Uh, is it possible, is he some sort of psychic?

     FRAISER
     Maybe we'll turn something up in our examinations.

     TEAL'C
     For the immediate, should not our concern be the threat of the
     planned Reetou attack?

     CARTER
     It doesn't make much sense. The Goa'uld attack the Reetou, so the
     Reetou rebels attack us?

     HAMMOND
     We need to determine the validity of what little information the
     boy's given us. Teal'c, I'd like you to accompany Colonel O'Neill to
     see him. Listen to his description of the attack on the Reetou and
     let me know if it appears to follow normal Goa'uld tactics.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Charlie is lying on a bed, and Fraiser is smoothing a band-aid on his
   arm.]

     FRAISER
     There you go. See? That didn't hurt at all, did it?

   [O'Neill enters with Teal'c behind him. Charlie sees them and jumps off
   the far side of the bed and runs in fear.]

     CHARLIE
     Jaffa!

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c)
     Get that a lot?

   [O'Neill catches Charlie and holds him by the shoulders.]

     O'NEILL
     Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! It's okay.

     CHARLIE
     He's a Jaffa! He wants to kill me, just like he killed the Reetou.

     O'NEILL
     No, no! No, no, no. He's a good Jaffa. in fact, he saved my life one
     time. He hates the Goa'uld as much as you do.

     CHARLIE
     No!

   [Teal'c looks disturbed by Charlie's reaction.]

     O'NEILL
     Oh, for cryin' out loud...

   [O'Neill stands up, addressing the room]

     O'NEILL
     Um, look, Mom. You said you trust me, right? Well, I'm telling you,
     Teal'c is okay. In fact, all my friends here at the base are okay.
     Okay?

     CHARLIE

     (pointing to his right)
     She's over there.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

     CHARLIE
     Mother says to trust only you, and the other members of your team.

     O'NEILL
     Good. Thank you. Charlie, Teal'c. Teal'c, Charlie.

     TEAL'C

     (walking toward Charlie and bowing his head)
     I am pleased to meet you.

   [Teal'c looks shocked by something now that he's closer to Charlie.]

     O'NEILL

     (kneeling next to Charlie)
     Listen, Charlie. We have to ask you some questions about the attack
     on your people. Can you talk about that?

   [Teal'c looks to be in pain and distress.]

     TEAL'C
     I...I...I am sorry, O'Neill. I must leave this room.

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me, Charlie. Um, Mother.

   [He leaves the room.]

   INT--HALLWAY OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     O'NEILL

     (concerned)
     What's the matter?

     TEAL'C
     My symbiote became agitated when I entered the room.

     O'NEILL
     Any idea why?

     TEAL'C
     I can tell you only this, O'Neill. In all of my years I have never
     experienced a symbiote so disturbed. There is something unusual
     about this child, O'Neill. I advise you to use extreme precaution in
     his handling.

     O'NEILL
     I was planning on it.

     TEAL'C
     You have seen it yourself. In the hands of the Goa'uld, a child is
     nothing more than a potent weapon.

     O'NEILL
     Carter and Fraiser checked him out for all the threats we
     encountered from the other kids.

   [Fraiser approaches them.]

     FRAISER
     l didn't find any apparent threat to us, but he's in worse shape
     than I thought, the poor kid. Several of his major organs have
     congenital defects.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, God.

     FRAISER
     It's like mother nature put him together in a hurry and got
     everything just a little wrong. His heart valves are defective, his
     renal function is a mess, and I have serious questions about his
     lungs. I'm afraid without some very aggressive medical intervention,
     he won't live to be much older than he is.

     O'NEILL
     Can you help him?

     FRAISER
     Maybe. But he may be beyond anything our medicine can do. There's
     something else.

   [She shows them a brain scan image.]

     FRAISER
     Charlie's CAT scan. Now, if you look along the lower part of the
     brain stem, this is the part where normal humans have what is called
     the reticular formation. It's the part of the brain that determines
     alertness, our perception of things. Charlie's is twice the size of
     ours. And that could explain why he knew you had a son. It may also
     explain why he had such an effect on Teal'c's symbiote.

     O'NEILL
     So, what? He's got ESP? Some telekinetic thing going on?

     FRAISER
     I don't know. I'm a skeptic on such things, but...

   [She walks away]

     O'NEILL
     It would explain a lot.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [We see a computer image of a body scan. The camera pans back to show
   Charlie in a hospital bed, dressed now in pajamas and lying on top of
   the covers. O'Neill is at his bedside; the rest of SG-1, Fraiser, and
   Hammond are behind him, near the door. SF's are standing guard at the
   door.]

     O'NEILL
     So, Charlie, tell us why the Reetou want to attack us.

     CHARLIE
     It's not the central authority of the Reetou. It's only the Reetou
     rebel faction.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Why do the rebels want to attack us?

     CHARLIE
     Because the glowing-eye people attacked the Reetou.

     DANIEL
     The Goa'uld?

     CHARLIE

     (after looking at an empty space in the room, seemingly for
     guidance)
     The rebels believe that the glowing-eye people are too powerful to
     destroy directly. They believe they can only be destroyed
     by...attrition.

     O'NEILL
     Attrition? What does that mean?

     DANIEL
     Uh, attrition is the gradual diminution of strength or number by...

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     I know what the word means. I meant in context.

     CARTER
     My God. They must want to kill all possible hosts. They must think
     that, if the Goa'uld have no new hosts to infest, that they'll
     eventually die out.

     DANIEL
     By attrition.

     CHARLIE
     Yes.

     CARTER
     Well, that's insane! There are billions of possible Goa'uld hosts,
     all throughout the galaxy.

     TEAL'C
     And they are not all human.

     CHARLIE
     Mother agrees. That is why the central authority of the Reetou sent
     us here.

     DANIEL

     (approaching the bed)
     Charlie, I'm curious. Are you a Reetou?

     CHARLIE

     (sitting up)
     No. I am of your species.

     DANIEL
     Is your mother a Reetou?

     CHARLIE
     Of course.

     DANIEL
     And is that why we can't see her?

     CHARLIE
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     Well, if you're one of us, why can you see her?

     CHARLIE

     (looking away for a moment, then back)
     'Cause I'm special.

     DANIEL
     You're special. How?

     CHARLIE
     Mother created me to serve as an intermediary.

     DANIEL
     She created you.

     CHARLIE
     Yes. She hoped I would be older before we came, but my accelerated
     growth caused my body to begin failing, so we had to come sooner.

     HAMMOND
     Captain, you're our physics expert here. Is it possible there's a
     creature standing here that we can't perceive?

     CARTER
     Theoretically it is possible, sir, yes. I mean, according to quantum
     physics, matter exists both in particles and waves. lf the Reetou
     waves are exactly 180 degrees out of phase with ours right down to
     the sub-atomic level, then their light and sound waves would be
     undetectable by us.

     O'NEILL
     So, what? Prepare for an attack by an invisible army?

     TEAL'C
     If there is a Reetou in this room, it came through the Stargate. And
     it is capable of controlling the iris.

     HAMMOND
     Son, how did your mother do that?

     CHARLIE
     I am no longer called Son. Call me Charlie.

     HAMMOND
     Charlie, how did your mother control the iris?

     CHARLIE
     Mother came ahead of me weeks ago. She observed you and how you
     operate the iris. Then, when the time came, she opened it for me
     just as you do.

     HAMMOND
     She just typed it into the computer?

     CARTER
     That is how the computer behaved, sir. As if it was being overridden
     by another console.

     DANIEL
     So the Reetou can operate things in our phase?

     CHARLIE

     (looking away and then back)
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     It is possible, sir, but it doesn't seem very likely.

     CHARLIE
     Mother is growing impatient with your narrow-mindedness.

   [A blue bolt shoots from the area Charlie has repeatedly look toward,
   taking out the computer monitor. The SF's bring up their weapons.]

     HAMMOND
     Stand down!

     O'NEILL
     I assume that came from...

     CHARLIE
     Mother.

     O'NEILL
     Mother.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Hammond is peering through the hole in the destroyed computer
   monitor.]

     HAMMOND
     Theories? Suggestions?

     CARTER
     It seems obvious that this Reetou exists.

     O'NEILL
     Well, here's a question. How do we deal with an invisible threat?

     CARTER
     We need a way to detect them.

     O'NEILL
     That would be helpful.

     TEAL'C
     I have that way. It seems my symbiote can sense this creature.

     O'NEILL
     Okay. Limited helpfulness right there.

     TEAL'C
     Explain.

     O'NEILL
     Can it tell us where exactly in a room a Reetou is, how many there
     are, what they're doing, et cetera?

     TEAL'C
     It was not that specific. It only detected a presence.

     O'NEILL
     So...limited.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps if my symbiote can detect this creature, the Goa'uld can
     also sense them.

     DANIEL
     That's a good point. They had to see them to wipe them out.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps the Tok'ra can be of assistance.

     HAMMOND
     It could be our best hope. Captain Carter, Doctor Jackson, signal
     the Tok'ra.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--ABOVE GROUND AT THE SGC.

   [Carter and Daniel activate the Tollan-supplied signaling device, which
   shoots a beam of light straight up.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate activates. Hammond is standing at the base of the ramp.
   Carter and Daniel join him, and Teal'c is standing to Hammond's left.
   Jacob and another Tok'ra exit the wormhole.]

     JACOB
     Hello, Sam.

   [They hug.]

     CARTER
     Dad, we have a little bit of a situation, and we may need Selmak's
     help.

     JACOB
     Selmak, Selmak, Selmak. I thought maybe you just wanted to see your
     old man.

     CARTER

     (smiling)
     I do, Dad.

     HAMMOND
     But this time we do need your symbiote, Jacob.

     JACOB
     Nice to see you too, George.

     HAMMOND

     (smiling)
     No offense, old friend.

   [Jacob dips his head for a moment, letting Selmak take control.]

     SELMAK
     It is an honor to once again return to your planet, General. What
     can we do for you?

     HAMMOND
     Have you ever heard of something called a Reetou?

     SELMAK
     Yes. Why?

     HAMMOND
     We may have one here.

     SELMAK

     (to other Tok'ra)
     Tok'ra kree. Tak lan onobi lon.
     (to Hammond)
     Please send him back to where we came from.
     (Hammond gives the signal to do so)
     In the meantime, take me to this Reetou.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Charlie wakes up to see O'Neill sitting not far away. O'Neill sees he
   is awake and walks over to the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     Hey, Charlie. How you feelin'?

     CHARLIE
     Tired. Really tired.

   [There is a sound of the door opening and people walking in.]

     CHARLIE
     For cryin' out loud.

   [O'Neill smiles at him, a bit surprised. Charlie looks to see who is
   entering. Hammond walks in and gestures, and we get a glimpse of Jacob.
   Charlie panics and scoots over to O'Neill, who hugs him.]

     O'NEILL
     Charlie? Charlie, it's all right. It's okay. It's all right, he's
     not a Goa'uld. It's a Tok'ra. They're okay.

   [Jacob's eyes grow wide in distress and he puts a hand on top of his
   head.]

     CARTER
     Dad?

   [Jacob leaves the infirmary.]

   INT--HALLWAY OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     JACOB

     Oh...
     (recovering)
     You are correct. There is a Reetou in that room.

   [Hammond, Teal'c, Daniel and the other Tok'ra join them.]

     JACOB

     (to the other Tok'ra)
     Taka ram.

   [The Tok'ra hands Jacob a hand-held device with two barrels.]

     JACOB
     This will illuminate the Reetou, if it is there. Follow me.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Jacob and the other Tok'ra enter and activate the devices, and start
   aiming them around the room.]

     O'NEILL

     (concerned)
     Jacob?

   [A large, green, insect like creature is revealed behind Charlie where
   he sits on the bed. It is moving in agitation. An SF raises his
   weapon.]

     CHARLIE

     (jumping up to put his body in front of the creature)
     Please don't hurt her!

     O'NEILL
     My God!

     HAMMOND
     Hold your fire.

     CARTER
     She could've hurt us a long time ago, if that's what she intended.

     JACOB

     (lowering his sensor/weapon)
     Tok'ra kree.

   [Jacob and the other Tok'ra leave the room. O'Neill walks toward
   Charlie.]

     O'NEILL

     Whoa.
     (to Charlie)
     I owe you an apology.

     CHARLIE
     I wouldn't lie to you, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     I know that. I'm sorry. Charlie, I want you to do me a favor.

     CHARLIE
     What?

     O'NEILL
     You and your mom stay in this room until I get back. Nobody's going
     to hurt you. I promise. Neither one of you. Okay?

     CHARLIE
     Okay.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

     O'NEILL
     Will somebody please explain to me how that...thing could be the
     kid's mother?

     DANIEL
     He said their leaders created him to communicate with us. They must
     have cloned him or engineered him somehow.

     FRAISER
     Well, all they'd need is some human DNA and it would be possible to
     construct him in a lab. It would also explain the extra reticular
     formation in his brain. Could have been genetically engineered to
     allow him perceive this Reetou 'mother'.

     O'NEILL
     But how do they do something that advanced, and leave the kid so
     screwed up?

     FRAISER
     Genetically engineering a human child would be a very precise
     exercise, Colonel. Changing one set of genes to alter the reticular
     formation could have numerous additional ramifications.

     CARTER
     Even though we can't see them, these Reetou can definitely see us.

     TEAL'C
     Which puts us at a great strategic disadvantage. I understand why
     the Goa'uld would want to eliminate them.

     O'NEILL
     They're Goa'uld, Teal'c. That's their job.

     JACOB
     The Reetou are a pretty peaceful race. The Goa'uld wiped most of
     them out just because they were a possible threat.

     DANIEL
     Okay. But how did the Goa'uld wipe them out?

     JACOB
     They were able to isolate the emissions that we are sensitive to and
     develop a device that would expose the creatures.

   [He holds up the device they used earlier.]

     JACOB
     This is a Transphase Eradication Rod. The Tok'ra have managed to rip
     off several versions of this device. It's also capable of
     terminating a Reetou.

     O'NEILL
     Well, do me a favor, will you? Don't terminate this Reetou. I
     promised the kid.

     HAMMOND
     It appears this Reetou came to warn us of an impending rebel attack.

     JACOB
     Yeah. The Reetou rebels are, um, kind of like terrorists are here on
     Earth...nasty guys. They could do a lot of damage here, folks. Kill
     a lot of people.

     O'NEILL
     How many are there?

     JACOB
     Don't know, but I do know their MO. They work in small groups of
     five suicide infiltrators. They sneak in, they split up, plant
     destructive devices, and try to maximise the damage before they've
     even been detected. But they usually attack Goa'uld planets. Uh, any
     idea why they want to attack here on Earth?

     CARTER
     Apparently to destroy all possible hosts.

   [Jacob shakes his head in disbelief.]

     DANIEL
     Is it possible that they can get though our iris?

     JACOB
     No. Their molecules wouldn't reintegrate any more than yours or
     mine.

     CARTER
     Can our weapons even touch them?

     JACOB
     Earth weapons will not be as effective as a TER. But since the
     Reetou are somewhat affected by solid matter in our phase, your
     weapons might at least slow them down.

     O'NEILL
     But, essentially, we'd be shooting at...nothing?

     JACOB
     You bet. Pretty tough to shoot at a moving target that you can't
     see. Even with TERs it's tough. Best weapon is advanced
     Intel...knowing where they'll come from and how.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I should talk to Mom. She might know where this rebel staging
     planet is.

     DANIEL
     Wait a minute. Say she does give us the address where they're coming
     from. Isn't it kinda risky to go looking for them? I mean, it's
     possible we may let more of them through to Earth and not even know
     it.

     JACOB
     If we've got TERs, we'll be able to see them.

     HAMMOND
     We need some intelligence, Dr. Jackson. It's the only way we'll know
     what we're up against.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [O'Neill enters. Charlie is lying on the bed, crying. When he sees
   O'Neill, Charlie wipes the tears from his eyes.]

     CHARLIE
     Mother says not to cry.

     O'NEILL
     Crying's okay.

     CHARLIE

     (after looking to where his mother must be)
     She says the boys of your culture do not cry.

     O'NEILL
     Not true.

   [He sits on the edge of the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     In fact, there's an official list of reasons for which crying is...a
     good thing.

     CHARLIE
     Mother is leaving.

     O'NEILL
     Now see, that's a good reason. 'Mom leaving', I believe, is number
     six on the list of good reasons. Actually six is 'Mom says she's
     leaving in a couple of days'. Five is 'Mom leaving immediately'.
     Four, of course, is 'Mom already left'. Now, three...three is huge.
     One of the bigger ones on the list.

     CHARLIE
     She's still here. She's leaving as soon as she has told you
     everything that can help.

     O'NEILL
     She's not taking you with her?

     CHARLIE
     She wants to leave me here with my own kind.

     O'NEILL
     Well, for what it's worth, I think she's right. I think you should
     stay here. You'd be better off.

     CHARLIE
     I think I belong with you, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Look, Charlie, um...Before she leaves, do you think she could she
     tell us where we can find these rebel Reetous?

     CHARLIE

     (looks off to Mother)
     She says she'll show me the address.

     O'NEILL
     That'd be great.

     CHARLIE
     Jack? Could I be your son for a while?

     O'NEILL
     I don't know, Charlie. I don't think you'd want that.

     CHARLIE
     Yes, I do. You'd be great. I can tell.

     O'NEILL
     I'll tell you what. Let's deal with these Reetou, then we'll talk
     about it, okay?

     CHARLIE
     Okay.

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A MALP has a TER attached to it. Many troops are in the room. The Gate
   klaxon is sounding, and the Gate activates. The MALP moves through. A
   view of the control room computer screen shows a graphic of the MALP.]

     TECHNICIAN
     MALP is en route.

     JACOB
     This is a bit of overkill, George. I told you, these rebels work in
     five-man squads. There'll only be five, maybe ten of them there.

     HAMMOND
     I don't wanna take any chances, Jacob. Okay, listen up! Colonel
     O'Neill is in charge of this operation.

     TECHNICIAN
     MALP has reached destination. Scanning with TER.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, I wanna remind you that this is a recon mission only. Do
     not engage the enemy unless you have no choice.

     O'NEILL
     Can't engage what you can't see, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Do your best for them not to see you, Colonel.

     TECHNICIAN
     MALP TER shows immediate Gate vicinity clear.

     O'NEILL
     All right. Here we go, kids. Move out!

   [A large force of Marines, the two Tok'ra, and SG-1 run up the ramp.
   View of traveling within the wormhole.]

   EXT--REETOU REBEL PLANET

   [The team exits the Gate. O'Neill grabs the TER from the MALP and
   begins scanning the area.]

     SELMAK
     Looks clear.

     O'NEILL

     Clear! Let's go do some snooping' around, what do you say?
     [to other Tok'ra)
     You stay with SG-12. Watch our six. Back sides.

   [O'Neill leads one team of Marines, SG-1 and Jacob away from the Gate.
   After a few steps, Teal'c and Jacob begin to be distressed. They drop
   to their knees, and O'Neill signals for the others to drop as well.<]

     SELMAK
     Colonel! The Reetou are present in that direction.

   [He points to his right]

     O'NEILL
     How many?

     SELMAK
     I don't know.

   [They move in the direction indicated and climb a small embankment. The
   TER's reveal many Reetou moving around in the distance. They are making
   screeching noises.]

     O'NEILL

     Whoa.
     (sarcastically)
     Five or ten...

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

     HAMMOND
     So you would say threat assessment is high?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, yeah.

     CARTER
     There were a lot of them, sir.

     TEAL'C
     They are indeed invisible.

     HAMMOND
     You're sure none of them came through with you?

     JACOB
     Can't be sure, but I don't think so. Selmak's tremors stopped a few
     seconds after we got through the Gate, and my guard did a TER sweep
     of the room.

     O'NEILL
     Course, it would only take one to open the iris. Correct?

     CARTER
     Well, we could put palm scanners into the iris control system to
     prevent that. I mean, I assume they don't have palms.

   [Jacob shakes his head.]

     HAMMOND
     Take who you need and do it now, Captain.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, let's go see the boy.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter has installed a palm scanner and is testing it while a
   technician works on his back, below the console. She presses her palm
   to the scanner and the computer shows she is identified and accepted.]

   [Teal'c becomes distressed and hunches over onto a console. Behind him
   the Tok'ra guard grabs his head.]

     CARTER

     Okay, that should...
     (seeing Teal'c's distress)
     Teal'c?
     (on telephone)
     Colonel O'Neill, are you with Charlie now? And Mom's there? I think
     we may have a stowaway Reetou who came back with us. Yeah.

   [She hits a button and the computer shows 'Red Alert Code 9', and the
   emergency klaxon begins sounding.]

     COMPUTER
     Lock-down in progress. Please stand clear of all-level access
     points.

   [The Tok'ra guard activates his TER and begins scanning. He sees the
   Reetou just as it fires it's weapon at him. The blue energy hits the
   Tok'ra and throws him through the control room window into the Gate
   room. The TER lands on the control room floor. Teal'c dives for it,
   barely evading another blue energy ball. He fires at the Reetou,
   blowing it into pieces. Teal'c goes to the now missing control room
   window and sees the Tok'ra guard lying dead on the Gate room floor
   below.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Jacob, O'Neill and Hammond are walking, with Jacob holding a TER.
   Jacob bends over in distress.]

     O'NEILL
     You all right?

     JACOB
     Strong Reetou.

   [He hands O'Neill the TER. O'Neill scans the hallway and sees four
   Reetou at the end. One launches a blue energy ball and the three duck
   out of the way. The bolt impacts the wall behind where they were and
   knocks over a table. Scanning again, O'Neill sees the Reetou are gone.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn it.

     HAMMOND
     Anyone get a count?

     O'NEILL
     We had four here, plus that one in the control room.

     JACOB
     Yeah, it's one of their terrorist teams. They didn't wanna be seen
     until their destruction had already started.

     O'NEILL
     So what will they do?

     JACOB
     Some of them will try to get out of the base and start, uh, making a
     mess of things.

     O'NEILL
     How?

     JACOB
     They have cross-phasal explosives, each one as powerful as a small
     nuke. I hate to tell you this, but those four Reetou rebels could
     level a couple of cities and take a lot of people with 'em.

     O'NEILL
     Sweet.

   INT--SGC ARMORY

   [The lights go to a low level. An SF is handing out weapons and
   everyone is gearing up.]

     COMPUTER
     Emergency lighting enabled.

     CARTER
     We've dimmed the lights to get a better contrast on the TER's, and
     we've shut down all access to this floor and sub 27. So, hopefully,
     they're trapped in here with us.

     O'NEILL
     Well, assume they are. We'll do a sweep of all three access
     corridors, sealing as we go. Try to corral them. Jacob, Carter,
     Chu...C-8. Teal'c, Rothman, Brecker...C-3. Daniel, Plunkett, you're
     with me. Let's move out.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c is leading two others, scanning with the TER.]

     TEAL'C

     (into radio)
     Seal blast door C-3 East.

   [He runs into a soldier coming from the other direction who almost
   shoots him. Teal'c gives him a frown.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Jacob, Carter, and Chu peek around a corner. A blue energy ball comes
   flying past them.]

     JACOB
     Reetou!

     CARTER
     Come on!

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill is scanning with TER.]

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Seal blast A-7 West.

   [The door drops behind him. Daniel comes in through the side door.]

     DANIEL
     Jack, what happens if they come through the door behind us?

     O'NEILL
     What?

   [O'Neill turns back to look at Daniel, thinking Daniel has seen
   something, then realizes he hasn't.]

     O'NEILL
     Don't do that!

   [O'Neill turns back and sees two Reetou ahead of them. He shoots one,
   but the other one shoots a blue bolt, which hits Plunkett and kills
   him. O'Neill and Daniel look on in regret.]

     O'NEILL
     Damn it.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR NEAR C-8

   [The C-8 door slides down to shut. Cater, Jacob, and Chu are searching
   around a corner on their knees. A door slides open and a Reetou fires
   at them. The blast hits Jacob in the arm and kills Chu.]

     CARTER
     Dad! You okay?

     JACOB

     (in pain)
     Not really. Get the damn thing! Selmak can take care of me.

     SELMAK
     Go!

   [Carter takes up position to fire on the doors protecting the Reetou.
   The doors open and the Reetou fires at Carter, missing her. Carter
   fires back with the TER but the doors have already closed. Carter
   prepares a grenade and bounces it off the tipped-over table top. It
   bounces through the open doors and blows up near the Reetou. Carter
   advances with the TER and finishes off the Reetou. Jacob nods in
   approval.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

   [O'Neill makes hand signals to the SF standing just inside the
   infirmary door. He makes signals and mouths words to Daniel, saying
   'you go inside in three' and counts to one with his thumb. Daniel
   signals back with two fingers walking and mouths 'there are people in
   there.' O'Neill mouths in annoyance 'I know' and mouths again 'in
   three' and counts off on his fingers...one, two, three. In slow motion,
   O'Neill goes in, followed by Daniel.]

   INT--SCG INFIRMARY

   [Fraiser and a nurse are standing behind Charlie's bed. SF's guard from
   inside the door.]

     O'NEILL
     Hit the deck!

   [A Reetou fires, hitting O'Neill and knocking the TER out of his hand.
   The SF's begin firing with machine guns. Daniel picks up the TER and
   aims it at the Reetou. A blue bolt comes from the side, blowing it up.
   Daniel turns to see it is Mother who fired.]

     CHARLIE
     Mother!

     DANIEL

     (to SF's)
     Don't shoot!

   [Another blue bolt comes from the side and blows up Mother.]

     CHARLIE
     Mother!

   [Fraiser rushes to comfort him. Daniel aims the TER at the Reetou who
   just killed Mother, and kills it. O'Neill is rolling around on the
   ground, his upper right arm injured from the earlier blast.]

     O'NEILL
     Ah!

     FRAISER

     (going to O'Neill)
     Easy, sir.

     O'NEILL
     All right, that hurts.

   [Carter and Teal'c enter. Daniel aims the TER at them momentarily and
   then lowers it, scared then relieved.]

     O'NEILL

     (lying on the floor)
     Give me a count.

     CARTER
     I got one.

     TEAL'C
     I also eliminated one.

     DANIEL
     And we got two, and Mother got one. I guess that makes five.

     CARTER
     So that should be all of them, right?

     O'NEILL
     Well, let's make sure. Take a team and do a sweep of the base,
     Captain.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   [As Fraiser is trying to treat him, O'Neill gets up onto his knees and
   moves over to Charlie.]

     O'NEILL

     Oh. God.
     (regretfully)
     I'm sorry.

   [O'Neill hugs Charlie, who is crying. Charlie goes limp and O'Neill
   notices something is wrong.]

     O'NEILL

     (holding Charlie with one good arm)
     Doc? Doc!

     FRAISER
     Give me a hand over here. Let's go! Get him up on the bed.

   [The SF lifts Charlie up onto the bed.]

     O'NEILL
     Easy.

   [O'Neill stands up on the other side of the bed. Fraiser opens
   Charlie's eye and shines a light into it.]

     O'NEILL
     What?

     FRAISER

     I don't know.
     (putting on stethoscope and checking him)
     His pulse is very weak. I maybe able to stabilize him for now, but,
     you have to remember, sir, he has two major organs about to fail.

     O'NEILL
     Oh, come on. He's just a kid. You've got all this fancy equipment
     around here...

     FRAISER
     Colonel, I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

     SELMAK
     Let us take him. He will be in good hands.

     O'NEILL
     Can the Tok'ra help him?

     SELMAK
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     Excuse me, isn't he a little young to be a host?

     SELMAK
     He is young, but the Tok'ra symbiote that we introduce to his mind
     can teach him. He will grow up with the advantages that great wisdom
     brings.

     O'NEILL
     Two key words there...'grow up'.

     FRAISER
     The Tok'ra are probably the only way that'll happen, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Do it.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1, Hammond, and Jacob are there. O'Neill's right arm is in a
   sling.]

     JACOB

     (to Carter)
     Keep the TERs. We'll get you more as soon as they become available.

   [Charlie and Fraiser enter, Charlie wearing his original clothing.
   Charlie is crying. O'Neill kneels in front of him.]

     O'NEILL
     You know, there's another rule that says it's okay to be sad when
     you're saying goodbye to a new friend.

     CHARLIE
     I wanna stay with you, Jack.

     O'NEILL
     Jacob's going to take you to a place where you can get well. I can't
     do that. But you know what?

     CHARLIE
     What?

     O'NEILL
     I'll come visit. You'll come visit. Okay?

     CHARLIE
     I guess.

   [Charlie is still crying. O'Neill touches his face and wipes away the
   tears, then stands up.]

     SELMAK
     I warn you, the Reetou are guileful creatures. And you are at the
     disadvantage of not being able to sense them, as my Jaffa friend and
     I can.

     CARTER
     Well, we've installed the hand scanner, so they can't open the iris
     at least.

     SELMAK
     You are only one, Teal'c. Please be diligent. They will not give up.
     They will attempt to send more infiltrators.

   [Teal'c nods in acknowledgment. The Gate activates.]

     JACOB

     (saying goodbye)
     George.

     CARTER
     Bye, Dad.

     JACOB
     You take care.

     CARTER
     You too.

   [Jacob reaches for Charlie's hand. O'Neill is standing with his left
   arm around Charlie's shoulder and gestures that it's okay to go.
   Charlie takes Jacob's hand and they walk up the ramp and through the
   wormhole. O'Neill looks very sad to see him go.]

   FADE OUT
