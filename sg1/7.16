   [Scenes from 6.09 "Allegiance"]

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Jacob, Delek, O'Neill and Carter watch the Jaffa's camp.]

     DELEK
     This is a base of the Tau'ri. Why are there Jaffa?

     CARTER
     Rebel warriors.

     DELEK
     Jaffa who turned against the Goa'uld?

     O'NEILL
     Is that going to be a problem?

     DELEK
     Not for us.

   [The Tok'ra and Jaffa face off against each other. O'Neill intervenes.]

     O'NEILL
     Somebody wanna tell me what's going on here?

     JACOB
     It's history. For two thousand years every time a Tok'ra died at the
     end of a staff weapon, a Jaffa was holding it.

   [Scenes from 7.11 "Evolution Part 1"]

   [A Super Soldier advances, firing on Teal'c.]

     JACOB
     This was obviously intended to be a new form of foot soldier.

   [A Supersoldier is shackled without its helmet.]

     SUPERSOLDIER
     I serve Anubis.

     CARTER
     Basically he's got all the strength and healing powers of a normal
     Goa'uld, but none of the normal personality traits.

     SELMAK
     This being was not alive when it was first grown.

     DANIEL
     Frankenstein's monster.

     SELMAK
     Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a device originally created
     by the Ancients. With the device, we may be able to devise a weapon
     to counteract its life giving energy.

   BEGIN CURRENT EPISODE

   INT--LABORATORY ON ALPHA SITE

   [Carter is working on a device as Jacob searches for something,
   becoming frustrated.]

     JACOB
     Where's the matrix crystal?

     CARTER
     Next to the primaries.

     JACOB
     I can't find anything in here. I had a system back at the old Alpha
     Site.

     CARTER
     The location of the old Alpha Site was compromised when Anubis used
     his mind probe on Jonas. You didn't really wanna hang around there
     did you?

     JACOB
     I just want to be able to work as efficiently as possible. Anubis'
     drones are kicking the crap out of the System Lords and we're next.
     This prototype should have been done weeks ago.

     CARTER
     It's done. It's just not... finished.

     JACOB
     Interesting distinction.

     CARTER
     Look, we only got Telchak's device a month ago. I'm surprised we
     were able to come up with something so quickly.

     JACOB
     In its current configuration, the weapon is only seventy percent
     effective at counteracting the reanimation technology.

     CARTER
     That's because the power unit you're using hasn't been properly
     calibrated. This one will be better.

     JACOB
     Maybe.

     CARTER
     Have you not had your coffee this morning?

     JACOB
     Selmak doesn't like coffee.

     CARTER
     You gave up coffee for your symbiote?

   [Jacob nods.]

     CARTER
     I didn't know that.

     JACOB
     We never talk anymore, Sam.

   [Carter sighs. An alarm sounds loudly, and a soldier rushes in through
   the door of the laboratory.]

     CARTER
     Lieutenant Glenn, what's happening?

     GLENN
     We're under attack. We just picked up Goa'uld ships entering the
     atmosphere. Colonel Riley has ordered immediate evac to Beta. We're
     bugging out right now.

   [Carter and Jacob exchange worried glances.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The klaxons are sounding and some technicians are preparing to send a
   MALP through. Hammond, Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c watch from the
   Control Room.]

     O'NEILL
     What happened?

     HAMMOND
     Approximately 20 minutes ago, the approach of Goa'uld ships prompted
     an evacuation of the Alpha site.

     DANIEL
     Sam was doing research there.

     HAMMOND
     She and Jacob were working on a weapon designed to neutralize
     Anubis' new soldiers. At the moment we have no idea what happened to
     either of them.

     O'NEILL
     How many people got out?

     HAMMOND
     Casualty reports are still coming in from the Beta Site, but at
     least 90 people are still missing, including the base commander,
     Colonel Reilly.

     O'NEILL
     I thought the location of the Alpha Site was secret.

     DANIEL
     We brought the gate there in a Tok'ra ship. It's a completely new
     address.

     TEAL'C
     Yet evidently, somehow the Goa'uld have discovered its whereabouts.

     DAVIS
     Chevron seven locked.

   [In the Gate room, the wormhole opens.]

     DAVIS
     Wormhole is stable, sir. No radio chatter.

     HAMMOND
     Send the MALP.

     DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

   [The MALP goes through the gate.]

     DAVIS
     MALP is en route. Receiving MALP telemetry.

   [He looks at the returning MALP video. It shows a pile of rocks.]

     DAVIS
     Sir, my instruments are telling me that the MALP is on its side.

     HAMMOND
     You still have camera control?

     DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

   [Davis slews the camera around to show the Stargate open but sitting at
   an odd angle amidst the rubble.]

     DANIEL
     If the Stargate was knocked over and is lying face down on the
     ground, the forming of the event horizon would have excavated a
     cavity underneath it. The MALP came through, and fell into the hole.

     HAMMOND
     There is no way to know if the DHD survived the attack.

     TEAL'C
     If we were to bring an alternate power source we could...

     DANIEL
     Dial out manually.

     HAMMOND

     (concerned)
     Possibly be under enemy fire.

     O'NEILL
     We'll be fine, sir. The gate dug the perfect foxhole.

     HAMMOND
     You have a go. Good luck, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you, sir.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [The gate deactivates revealing O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel in the hole
   beneath it. They climb out of the hole using a ladder. They find the
   site has been devastated, with fires still burning amid the rubble. No
   buildings are visible.]

     DANIEL
     Wow.

     TEAL'C
     This destruction does not appear to be the result of an aerial
     assault.

     O'NEILL

     (putting on his sun glasses)
     Single-radius blast.

     TEAL'C
     Quite possibly the self destruct, to prevent the Alpha Site from
     falling into enemy hands.

   [Later, Reynolds' team, SG-3, arrives through the Gate.]

     O'NEILL
     So we'll split up, search for survivors.

     REYNOLDS
     Who could have survived this?

     O'NEILL

     (giving him a look and then pointing)
     Start with the tree line there.

     REYNOLDS
     Copy.

     O'NEILL
     Move out.

   [O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c walk through some of the smoldering ruins
   of the buildings; Reynolds's team does the same in the opposite
   direction.]

     TEAL'C

     (staring at something on the ground)
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     (walking over to join him)
     What have you got?

     TEAL'C
     This is the armour of one of Anubis' drones.

     O'NEILL

     (via radio)
     Reynolds.

     REYNOLDS

     (via radio)
     Go ahead.

     O'NEILL
     Be advised, we may not be alone here. At least one of Anubis' goons
     might have been on the planet when it blew. Use extreme caution.

     REYNOLDS
     Understood.

   [Proceeding cautiously through the woods, Reynolds' team hears some
   strange noises and goes to investigate. They find some survivors hidden
   in the forest. There are Jaffa and Tok'ra as well as SGC personnel.]

     GREEN
     Colonel.

     REYNOLDS
     Major Green, you all right?

     GREEN
     I'm fine, sir. We got some serious injuries here.

   [Several men are down and some Tok'ra are caring for them.]

     REYNOLDS
     Any other survivors in the area?

     GREEN
     As far as I know, we're the only ones, sir.

   [Reynolds contacts O'Neill via radio.]

     REYNOLDS
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL
     Go ahead.

     REYNOLDS
     We found twelve survivors but they're not in good shape.

     O'NEILL
     How bad?

     REYNOLDS
     Some can walk, but most need immediate medical treatment.

     O'NEILL
     Major Carter with them?

     REYNOLDS

     (looks at Green, who shakes his head)
     I'm afraid not.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill is communicating with the Control Room via radio.]

     O'NEILL
     SG-3 is gonna need a little help to get the Gate back up.

     HAMMOND
     SG's 11 and 21 are assembling now, Colonel. I'll be sending them
     through momentarily. Unfortunately that means a delay before I can
     send any other resources to help with the search.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

     O'NEILL
     Getting the wounded out is our first priority, sir.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Agreed, but if there are any other survivors out there, they may not
     have a lot of time.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE

     O'NEILL
     Understood, sir. We'll keep trying.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Jack and the others are still searching. They spot Jacob trapped
   underneath a fallen tree trunk.]

     O'NEILL
     Jacob!

   [Teal'c lifts the tree up off of Jacob's leg as Jacob moans. Daniel
   sees to his leg and prepares to give some first aid.]

     JACOB
     Anubis' drones..

     O'NEILL
     We know.

     JACOB

     (handing them the upgraded power unit he and Sam were working on)
     Take this. It's not a hundred percent, but it's all we've got. It
     only has a few more shots. Sam has a fully charged power unit.

     O'NEILL
     Where is she?

     JACOB
     I don't know. I don't even know if she's still alive.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [With the Gate open, the SG teams bring the wounded through on
   stretchers, including Jacob. Daniel is with them. Medical teams
   transfer the wounded to gurneys.]

     HAMMOND
     How are you doing?

     JACOB

     (settling onto a gurney)
     It's nothing Selmak can't handle.

     HAMMOND
     Jacob, we need to know what happened out there. How did Anubis get
     the location to the new Alpha Site?

     JACOB
     I have no idea. I was with Sam when the self destruct went off. One
     of the drones was chasing us into the forest. George, if I survived
     the blast... you know that thing survived as well.

   [Hammond exchanges a look with Daniel.]

     HAMMOND
     What about the prototype weapon?

     JACOB
     I gave it to Colonel O'Neill. But it's only semi-effective in its
     current configuration. The upgraded power unit was with Sam.

     HAMMOND
     And we have no idea of where she is?

     DANIEL
     She's still missing.

     HAMMOND
     Is there anything else we can use against these drones?

     JACOB
     Their armour is impervious to energy weapons, and regular firearms
     are useless.

     DANIEL
     What about the drones that were killed in the blast?

     JACOB
     Kinetic energy. An explosion of that size -- they can't ignore
     physics.

     DANIEL
     Ah, so with enough kinetic energy..

     JACOB
     There would have to be a lot.

     HAMMOND
     How about a missile?

     JACOB
     That might do it... if you get close enough.

     HAMMOND
     Sergeant Siler, prepare a UAV with UCAV specs.

     SILER
     Yes, sir.

   [The medical team wheels Jacob away and Hammond and Daniel exchange
   worried looks.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond is sitting down at the table; Major Green is standing before
   him.]

     GREEN
     Am I in some kind of trouble here, sir?

     HAMMOND
     The fact that the Alpha Site has been compromised indicates we've
     got a serious breach of security on our hands here. The Pentagon is
     demanding that I launch a formal enquiry immediately. Just tell me
     what happened, son.

     GREEN
     To tell you the truth, sir, I'm not entirely sure myself. I was
     still at chow when the alarm went off. By the time I made it to the
     command centre, Colonel Reilly had already ordered the evacuation.

     HAMMOND
     What happened to the Stargate?

     GREEN
     It was hit by an Alkesh bomber. We were cut off. That's when the
     drones landed in scout ships. They took everything that we threw at
     them and they just kept coming.

     HAMMOND
     So Colonel Reilly ordered a self-destruct?

     GREEN
     He knew there was some sensitive material on the base, sir. He
     stayed with the device so the enemy wouldn't have a chance to disarm
     it. He told the rest of us that we had one minute to make it to the
     tree line. I should have stayed with him.

     HAMMOND
     You were following orders, Major.

     GREEN

     (emotional)
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Can you tell me if there was any unusual activity at the Alpha Site
     in the last few days? Any unscheduled gate activations or
     unexplained signals?

     GREEN
     No, sir.

     HAMMOND
     What about the Jaffa and the Tok'ra?

     GREEN
     Well, they haven't been getting along very well, but there's nothing
     unusual about that.

     HAMMOND
     I want a list of all personnel -- Human, Tok'ra, and Jaffa -- who've
     come and gone to the Alpha Site gate in the last 48 hours.

     GREEN
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Teal'c and Jack are walking along a path.]

     TEAL'C
     Footprints.

     O'NEILL
     Standard issue from the SGC.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. The depth of the impression is consistent with someone of
     Major Carter's size.

     O'NEILL
     There's another set over there.

     TEAL'C
     They seem to be much larger. Perhaps a drone.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah.

     TEAL'C
     Do you believe this prototype weapon will be effective against it?

     O'NEILL
     We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it.

   [They keep moving.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Daniel is sitting next to Jacob's bed.]

     DANIEL
     So, uh, how's the leg?

     JACOB
     It's getting there, slowly but surely.

     DANIEL
     Oh yeah, slowly. The way you heal it'll probably take a day.

     JACOB
     You didn't come here to ask me about my leg. You want to know what
     happened to Sam.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

     JACOB
     The base was under attack. We could hear the explosions getting
     closer... and the sound of scout ships approaching.

   [Flashback to assault on the Alpha Site.]

   INT--ALPHA SITE LABORATORY

   [There are sounds of attack, and the building is shaking.]

     GLENN
     We have to leave now!

     CARTER
     Just give me a second.

     JACOB

     (speaking in the background from the present)
     We had to download the weapon design into the matrix crystal and
     wipe the computer memory.

     GLENN
     You have the prototype!

     JACOB
     We can't leave this information for them to find!

     GLENN
     How much longer?

     CARTER
     Finished!

   [A series of energy shots come through the door and kill Glenn
   instantly. Carter and Jacob take cover as a Supersoldier bursts through
   the door. Jacob stands up and shoots it once with the prototype weapon;
   it falls to its knees.]

     JACOB
     It worked!

   [The Supersoldier stands up once more.]

     CARTER
     Not good enough.

   [Jacob shoots the Supersoldier again and it falls down again.]

     JACOB
     Let's get out of here.

   [They leave the laboratory, Jacob holding the weapon and Carter the
   charged power module.]

   [End of flashback]

     JACOB
     The Stargate was hit; we couldn't get out. So we ran for the hills.
     The drone followed us. If Sam is still alive, it's still after her.

     DANIEL
     Maybe it's just hiding, waiting for a chance to go back through the
     Gate.

     JACOB
     Out of all the rooms on the base, why did it come to that lab? And
     why did it chase us as opposed to anyone else?

     DANIEL
     You think it knew about the prototype?

     JACOB
     I think that was the whole reason for the attack. Somehow Anubis
     knows we may have the only weapon in the galaxy capable of stopping
     his soldiers.

     DANIEL
     And Sam has the design.

     JACOB
     That thing won't stop until it finds her.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Siler is preparing a UAV equipped with two small missiles.]

     HAMMOND
     Sergeant Siler, report.

     SILER
     Ready to go, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Well done. I want it airborne now.

     SILER
     Yes, sir.

     DAVIS
     General, Medical reports that the leader of the Jaffa survivors is
     cleared for debriefing.

     HAMMOND
     I want to speak to him immediately.

     DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

   [Hammond and Davis exit.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond is talking to the Jaffa leader.]

     M'ZEL
     I do not understand why I am being questioned.

     HAMMOND
     We need to determine exactly what happened.

     M'ZEL
     If you wish to know who betrayed the secret of your base, I suggest
     you ask the Tok'ra.

     HAMMOND
     Why do you say that?

     M'ZEL
     They are without honour.

     HAMMOND
     They're your allies.

     M'ZEL
     Then why will they not help us?

     HAMMOND
     What are you talking about?

     M'ZEL
     Even as we speak, Anubis is moving against the system lord Olokun.
     His drones are slaughtering the Jaffa that stand against them. They
     are dying for a hopeless cause.

     HAMMOND
     What does that have to do with the Tok'ra?

     M'ZEL
     We believe that they have a spy in Olokun's higher ranks. One who
     could get close enough to assassinate him.

     HAMMOND
     The Tok'ra keep us apprised of their ongoing operations. I have no
     knowledge of any spy in Olokun's ranks.

     M'ZEL
     Then they are lying to you as well. With their master dead, the
     siege would be over and Olokun's Jaffa would be free to join our
     movement.

     HAMMOND
     Out gate logs show that a group of Jaffa left the Alpha site less
     then 24 hours before it was attacked. You sent your own people
     didn't you?

     M'ZEL
     Yes.

     HAMMOND
     Have they reported back?

     M'ZEL
     They have not.

     HAMMOND
     If they were captured by Anubis--

     M'ZEL
     No Jaffa would succumb to torture.

     HAMMOND
     Anubis doesn't have to resort to torture. He has technology at his
     disposal that will allows him to simply read a prisoner's mind.

     M' ZEL
     When Heru'ur was killed, I was forced to pledge allegiance to the
     System Lord Apophis. The slayer of my master became my master. So it
     has been for all Jaffa for many thousands of years. But now we can
     choose to fight our oppressors, we can choose to be free. I ask only
     that the Jaffa who serve Olokun be given that same choice. If you
     allow me to go to the Beta Site to speak to the other survivors, I
     may be able to discover what happened to the Jaffa we sent.

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Jack and Teal'c are still searching. Jack reports to Hammond via
   radio.]

     HAMMOND

     (via radio)
     Colonel O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     General.

     HAMMOND
     Status report.

     O'NEILL
     We found tracks, sir. They could be Carter's.

     HAMMOND
     What direction?

     O'NEILL
     East, up into the hills.

     TEAL'C
     The higher ground is a more defensible position.

     HAMMOND
     Understood, I'll have the UAV fly a search pattern in that area.
     Hammond out.

   EXT--HILLS ABOVE THE ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Carter is sitting in the shade nursing an injured leg. When a drone
   walks towards her, she lies close to the ground as it turns in her
   direction. It walks past her.]

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Jacob taps on the door and walks in. He has a cane in his right hand
   and is limping slightly.]

     HAMMOND
     Jacob.

     JACOB
     Any news on Sam?

     HAMMOND
     Not yet, but we have a UAV airborne and all available SG teams are
     searching. I don't know anyone tougher or more resourceful. She'll
     find a way out of this.

     JACOB

     (nodding)
     How's the investigation going?

     HAMMOND
     I have been meaning to talk to you about that. Do you know anything
     about a Tok'ra operative within Olokun's ranks?

     JACOB
     No.

     HAMMOND
     According to the Jaffa, you have a spy in his inner circle.

     JACOB
     They're mistaken.

   [The klaxons begin to sound.]

     DAVIS

     (via intercomm system)
     Unscheduled off-world activation.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Hammond and Jacob go to the Gate room. M'Zel comes through the gate.]

     HAMMOND
     Did you learn anything at the Beta Site?

     M' ZEL
     Of the Jaffa sent to recruit rebels from Olokun's army, only one has
     returned. The fate of the others is unknown. Anubis has won a major
     victory. Thousands of Jaffa have been killed, and many of Olokun's
     commanders captured. The Tok'ra spy among them....

     JACOB
     That's impossible. If we had someone on the inside, I would have
     known about it.

     HAMMOND
     Are you sure?

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Carter is running through the trees. She stops and sits against a tree
   to adjust the bandage on the deep gash on her leg. The Supersoldier is
   picking up a trail of blood. He comes across a body, but it isn't
   Carter. Carter gets up and keeps moving.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     HAMMOND
     Thank you for your co-operation in this matter, Delek.

     DELEK
     I do not see the need to continue this investigation, General. The
     Jaffa have as much as admitted responsibility.

     HAMMOND
     All we know for sure is that some of the men they sent to recruit
     rebels from Olokun's armies didn't return.

     DELEK
     Because they were captured in Anubis' latest offensive. It is the
     most logical explanation.

     HAMMOND
     According to the Jaffa, a Tok'ra spy was also captured.

     DELEK
     We both know that Jaffa intelligence is not always as reliable as it
     should be.

     HAMMOND
     So you're saying you haven't got an operative in Olokun's ranks?

     DELEK

     (considering)
     I am unable to discuss such matters at this present time.

     HAMMOND
     The terms of our alliance dictate full disclosure.

     DELEK
     In matters of joint concern.

     HAMMOND
     The security of the Alpha Site is a matter of joint concern.

     DELEK
     But the disposition of our operatives has no bearing on the security
     of the Alpha Site.

     HAMMOND
     So you claim.

     DELEK
     You have allies amongst the other nations of this planet do you not?

     HAMMOND
     Of course.

     DELEK
     Do you always practise full disclosure with them?

     HAMMOND
     We gave you shelter when you had nowhere else to go.

     DELEK
     Because you needed us. Just as you brought us Telchak's re-animation
     device because you needed our help to develop a weapon against
     Anubis' drones. But you are not always so forthcoming. There is for
     example your program to build and design hybrid ships using Goa'uld
     technologies. A program which the Tok'ra feels extremely unwise.

     HAMMOND
     We need those ships for the defence of Earth.

     DELEK
     And so you feel it is none of our concern. You see, General, it
     works both ways. You ask us to trust that your headlong pursuit of
     technologies that you don't understand poses no threat. But you fail
     to offer similar consideration when it comes to our policy on using
     covert operatives.

     HAMMOND
     Let me ask you something. How many Tok'ra from the Alpha site are
     still unaccounted for?

     DELEK
     Five.

     HAMMOND
     Do you know how many people I'm missing? Sixty-four. Believe me when
     I say I'm going to get to the bottom of this with or without your
     help.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE

   [Cater is still trying to elude the Supersoldier. She stops to drink
   some water from a lake. She's clearly exhausted. The soldier is on the
   opposite side of the water and starts firing. She heads back into the
   trees as it pursues her.]

   INT--SGC VIP QUARTERS

   [Delek opens the door to find Jacob there.]

     DELEK
     I've been expecting you. No doubt you've spoken to General Hammond.

     JACOB
     He says he asked you if we had a spy in Olokun's inner circle.

     DELEK
     Yes, he did.

     JACOB
     He asked me the same question. Of course I told him no, because only
     the High Council could make a decision like that. And since I'm on
     the High Council, I would know about it. Wouldn't I? Or is there
     something you want to tell me.

     DELEK
     If you have a concern, you can take it up with the Council yourself.

     JACOB

     (grabbing him by the arm)
     Who do you think you're talking to?

     DELEK
     An interesting question. It seems I am talking to a human host.

     SELMAK

     (after bowing his head)
     Make no mistake, Delek. I am still Selmak. And I was a leader of the
     Tok'ra before you had even taken a host.

     DELEK
     Maybe you've been a leader too long. The Tau'ri are unlike other
     humans in the galaxy. Their will has not been eroded by thousands of
     years of slavery. This can be a valuable asset, but it can also make
     them dangerous -- particularly as hosts.

     SELMAK
     Jacob Carter has had no more influence on me than any other host.

     DELEK
     There are those of us who would disagree. You have allowed yourself
     to get too close to these people, Selmak. Your true loyalties are in
     question.

     SELMAK
     Do you speak for the entire Council?

     DELEK
     You still have your defenders. Although their numbers are
     diminishing.

     SELMAK
     So you did meet without me... and you did send an operative.

     DELEK
     And if you had known, would you have told General Hammond?

     SELMAK
     They have a right to know.

     DELEK
     We knew you would feel that way, which is precisely why you were not
     informed.

   INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Jacob meets with Hammond]

     HAMMOND
     So Delek admits that this spy has gone missing.

     JACOB
     Yes. But the Tok'ra will never acknowledge that he could have been
     responsible for what happened at the Alpha Site. Tok'ra operatives
     have orders never to allow themselves to be taken alive.

     HAMMOND
     What about a sarcophagus.

     JACOB
     They take special precautions to ensure that the brain is not left
     intact. No revival is possible.

     HAMMOND
     This is all assuming the man wasn't taken unawares.

     JACOB
     The system isn't foolproof. But they won't admit that. The truth is,
     I don't think you'll ever find out for sure who was responsible for
     the leak. It could have been the Tok'ra or the Jaffa. It could have
     been both. Look, I've helped you as much as I can with this
     investigation, but right now I'd like to get back to the Alpha Site
     and join the search.

     HAMMOND
     I need you here.

     JACOB
     George I already told you, I'm out of the loop. They don't trust me
     anymore; they think my emotions are clouding my judgement. Which is
     a little ironic considering that I'm wasting all this time while my
     own daughter is out there being hunted by that thing.

     HAMMOND
     We have our best people on this, Jacob. They will find her.

     JACOB
     What am I supposed to do in the meantime?

     HAMMOND
     I just got a report from the Beta Site. The Jaffa are blaming the
     Tok'ra for what happened. There have already been several
     altercations. If I can't get the situation under control, I have
     orders to expel them all. Our alliance is falling apart. I need
     someone to bridge the gap, someone to be the voice of reason. I need
     you.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Hidden beneath some vines, Carter spots the UAV in the sky and uses
   her watch to reflect the sun onto it, revealing her position. Just as
   the sun is catching on her watch, the Supersoldier sees the UAV and
   shoots it down. Carter hides and he walks by her. Not far from Cater's
   position, Jack is paged through the radio. ]

     REYNOLDS

     (via radio)
     O'Neill.

     O'NEILL

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     REYNOLDS
     A UAV has been shot down in your area. It's four klicks away on a
     heading of three two zero degrees from your present location.

     O'NEILL
     We're on it.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Jacob meets with M'Zel.]

     M' ZEL
     Why have you asked me here?

     JACOB

     (nods at the guard to leave and he does)
     You know what's happening at the Beta site?

     M'ZEL
     I do.

     JACOB
     We need your help to put a stop to it before it gets out of hand.
     You're a leader amongst the Jaffa. They'll listen to you.

     M'ZEL
     And what would you have me say? That they must continue to bear the
     arrogance of the Tok'ra without complaint? That they must be
     subservient to those who would sacrifice so many of their brothers?

   [Jacob bows his head.]

     SELMAK
     For thousands of years, the Jaffa have been dependant on the Goa'uld
     because they need symbiotes to sustain them. But now there is a
     substance called Tretonin which can free the Jaffa from this
     dependence.

     M'ZEL
     I'm aware of the significance of Tretonin.

     SELMAK
     Are you also aware that countless millions of Tok'ra symbiotes died
     in its development? Including our beloved Queen, Egeria? The Queen
     from which all our lineage can be traced?

     M'ZEL
     I was not.

     SELMAK
     For the first time, the Tok'ra have fought side by side with the
     Jaffa and the people of the Tau'ri. And it has made a difference.
     More System Lords have fallen in the past seven years than in the
     700 years previous.

     M'ZEL
     It is true that together we are strong.

     SELMAK
     And divided, we will die.

   [He bows his head.]

     JACOB

     (sighing)
     We cannot let the alliance between us end.

     M'ZEL
     Your words are wise, but my time at the Alpha Site has taught me
     some bitter lessons. I suspect that you do not speak for all the
     Tok'ra.

     JACOB
     No.

     M'ZEL
     Until the others feel as you do, reconciliation may not be possible.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [Carter finds the UAV amidst some boulders. She begins working on it,
   removing part of it and taking the missile, placing it on top of the
   wing. She takes a piece of wiring from the UAV then opens the top of
   the missile.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Hammond, Daniel, M'Zel, Jacob, and Delek are seated at the table.]

     HAMMOND
     Gentlemen, we've asked you here together because we need your help
     to keep the situation at the Beta Site from getting out of hand.

     DELEK
     I'm not sure what you expect the Tok'ra to do, General. We have
     suffered a number of unprovoked assaults.

     M'ZEL
     Unprovoked? You refused to help us and thousands of Jaffa died
     needlessly.

     DELEK
     Assassinating Olokun was never an option.

     DANIEL
     Why not?

     DELEK
     We had no way of knowing how many Jaffa would join the rebels. We
     could have been delivering an entire army into the hands of Anubis.

     M'ZEL
     They deserved the right to choose. Instead, they were slaughtered.

     DELEK
     We have been fighting the Goa'uld for thousands of years. You have
     no right to question our methods.

     DANIEL
     That's because you were alone for thousands of years. You have
     allies now.

     DELEK
     And what good has it done us? In the few short years we have known
     the Tau'ri, your tendency to provoke direct confrontation with the
     Goa'uld has resulted in the deaths of more Tok'ra than in the
     previous 100 years combined.

     JACOB
     I hate to admit it George, but he's got a point. When a human or a
     Jaffa dies in battle, more are born to take their place. The same
     can't be said for the Tok'ra.

     DELEK
     Our Queen Egeria, from whom all Tok'ra are spawned, is dead. Our
     numbers are dwindling. This alliance may simply be something we
     cannot afford.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE, DAY

   [The Supersoldier approaches Carter's MacGuyvered UAV, and she ducks
   down. Seeing her, he starts firing. She fires the missile, which hits
   him and explodes. O'Neill and Teal'c hear the noise and set off
   running. An exhausted Carter sits on a sandy slope. The Soldier
   unburies itself from the dirt and takes aim at Carter. Teal'c arrives
   and starts firing a machine gun at it, distracting it. Carter hides
   behind a pile of rocks at the soldier fires on Teal'c. O'Neill arrives
   and fires the prototype weapon at it, slowing it down. O'Neill kneels
   down next to Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter I need the--

   [She hands him the upgraded power unit.]

     O'NEILL
     Thanks.

   [He places it in the prototype gun and fires. Two shots take the
   Supersoldier out.]

     O'NEILL

     (to Teal'c, tossing him the weapon)
     Cover him.

     CARTER
     Is it...

     O'NEILL

     Yeah, he's dead... Right Teal'c, he's dead?
     (Teal'c kicks the soldier, then nods)
     Yeah, he's dead. You wanna get up?

     CARTER
     I just need to rest for a minute.

   [He looks at her as she tries to catch her breath, then sits down next
   to her.]

     O'NEILL
     Come here.

   [He puts his arm around her, and she rests her head on his shoulder as
   Teal'c looks down on the dead Supersoldier.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DELEK
     First of all, we'd like to congratulate you on the recovery of Major
     Carter. We're glad to know that she is safe.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you.

     DELEK
     I have spoken to the High Council with regard to the situation at
     the Beta Site. The Council believes the best solution is for the
     Tok'ra to leave.

     DANIEL
     Is that really necessary?

     DELEK
     If this partnership were to continue, you would insist on full
     disclosure of all our covert operations, would you not?

     HAMMOND
     I'm afraid that's non-negotiable.

     DELEK
     In that case, we must refuse. Secrecy is our only weapon. It's all
     we've ever known.

     M'ZEL
     The Jaffa, too, will be leaving.

     HAMMOND
     I don't understand. With the Tok'ra gone--

     M'ZEL
     We are not leaving because of the Tok'ra. We are leaving because it
     is what we must do. On your base, you dictate the terms. We must
     consult you before we take any action. There are those among us who
     feel we simply traded one master for another.

     HAMMOND
     We're not trying to tell you what to do. We simply think it's
     important to coordinate our efforts.

     M'ZEL
     Unlike the Tau'ri or the Tok'ra, the Jaffa are still learning what
     it means to be free. In order to do this we must have our own bases.
     Train our own leaders, build our own communities. We must do this
     for ourselves or it would have no meaning. Only then can we be equal
     partners in any alliance.

     DANIEL

     (angry)
     I'm sorry, this is nuts! My friend almost died out there so that we
     could get a weapon capable of stopping Anubis' soldiers. And now
     we're finally in a position where we can really make a difference,
     and you wanna walk away?

     DELEK
     I'm sorry, Doctor Jackson.

     M'ZEL
     This is how it must be.

   [Hammond appears very concerned, and Daniel nods in resignation.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [Carter wakes up to find Jacob sitting next to her bed.]

     JACOB
     Hiya kid. You were asleep for a long time. You gave me quite a
     scare.

     CARTER
     Sorry.

     JACOB
     Jack told me what happened. I'm proud of you. Look, Sam, I may not
     be able to come around this much for the next little while.

     CARTER
     What do you mean?

     JACOB
     Things kind of got screwed up while you were out there. The alliance
     is in trouble.

     CARTER
     I don't understand.

     JACOB
     You don't need to know the details right now. Let's just say we're
     going our separate ways for a while. If I stay with the Tok'ra, I
     can at least try to mend some fences.

     CARTER
     Are you sure?

     JACOB
     I'm not ready to give up on this just yet.

   [He kisses her on the forehead.]

     JACOB
     Don't worry, I'll be back eventually.

     CARTER

     (upset)
     I'll miss you.

     JACOB
     I'll miss you, too.

   [Carter appears upset and worried.]
