   TEASER

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey travels through hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY GYM

   [The gym has various workout equipment and machines set around a square
   area marked off on the floor. Dressed in sweats and tee-shirts, Teal'c
   and Mitchell are the only ones there. They spar with Sodan training
   sticks within the square. They come to an impasse, sticks crossed.]

     TEAL'C
     This vessel does not have a pool.

     MITCHELL
     I was talking about the gambling variety.

   [They parry for a few more seconds, until Teal'c hits Mitchell in the
   lower back. Mitchell grabs his back, and Teal'c steps away from him.]

     TEAL'C
     I do not wish to speculate.

     MITCHELL
     He only said it was something important. You're not the least bit
     curious?

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. But I would not risk a wager.

   [He swings at Mitchell again, who ducks the blow with a yell.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Daniel walks down the corridor while reading a book. He comes to a
   door and barely looks up as it opens. Inside the large room are Vala
   and a large group of crewmembers. There are balloons, streamers, and a
   cake with sparkling candles burning on it. Vala stands on top of a
   table.]

     VALA AND CREW

     (together)
     Surprise!

   [They all smile at Daniel, pushing the balloons around and laughing.
   Daniel smiles mildly at them but barely reacts.]

     DANIEL
     It's not my birthday.

   [He nods to them, turns, and starts walking down the corridor, back to
   reading his book. Vala laughs nervously then jumps down off the table
   and follows him into the corridor.]

     VALA
     Hey! We made a weird cat pinada thingy.

     DANIEL

     (turning to face her)
     I told you to bring something to amuse yourself. I didn't mean me or
     the crew.

     VALA
     But they won't believe that it's my birthday...again.

     DANIEL
     Not my problem.

   [He turns and walks away from her.]

     VALA
     Being stuck on this ship is worse than being stuck at the SGC. I-I-I
     tell you, the last time I was this bored, I took hostages!

     DANIEL

     (without looking back)
     I was there.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry and Carter arrive on the Bridge. Landry is dressed in his dress
   uniform, not BDU's.]

     LANDRY
     Major?

     MARKS
     We're approaching the coordinates, sir.

     LANDRY
     Drop us out.

   [Landry sits in the command chair.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey comes out of hyperspace above a planet.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MARKS
     We're being hailed. The Asgard are requesting permission to beam
     aboard, sir.

   [The rest of SG-1 arrive on the bridge.]

     LANDRY
     Granted.

   [Thor beams in to the forward part of the bridge, in front of
   everyone.]

     THOR
     Greetings, and welcome to Orilla.

     CARTER
     Thor!

   [Carter steps forward, closer to Thor.]

     THOR
     Hello, Colonel Carter. It is good to see you.

     VALA

     (quietly, to Daniel)
     Out of curiosity, how can you tell the difference?

     DANIEL
     The voice.

     CARTER
     It's good to see you too, Thor. This is General Landry, Colonel
     Mitchell and Vala.

     THOR
     Greetings.

     DANIEL
     So, Thor, how you been? Haven't heard from you in a while.

     THOR
     I am sorry. I have been otherwise occupied. As mentioned in our
     communication, the High Council wishes to meet with you, to explain
     in greater detail, but there is not much time. General, with your
     permission, a number of Asgard are prepared to beam aboard
     immediately to begin installing various technological upgrades to
     this ship.

     MITCHELL

     (to Teal'c)
     I hope it's ray guns. I got ray guns in the pool.

     LANDRY
     What is it you're planning on giving us?

     THOR
     Everything we have...and know.

     VALA
     By that, you mean...

     THOR
     Everything. All our most current technology. All our knowledge.

   [Everyone stands silent for a moment.]

     DANIEL
     Sorry, we're just a little stunned. I mean, why are you doing this?
     You've always resisted in the past. You always said we weren't
     ready.

     THOR
     Indeed. Many Asgard still believe that.

     MITCHELL
     So what's changed?

     THOR
     As a race, we are dying. Very soon, we will all be gone.

   [Everyone shifts in place, shocked.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [There are several Asgard walking around the ship, mingling with the
   crew.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Thor and Carter are working at an Asgard console just added to the
   engine room.]

     THOR
     The Asgard computer core is equipped with its own power source that
     will not infringe on your ship's ZPM. However, when the upgrades are
     complete, the core will be fully integrated into all the ship's
     systems.

     CARTER
     There must be something more you can do.

     THOR
     I assure you, we are providing you with all the latest Asgard
     technology, as well as a knowledge base, including our entire
     recorded history.

     CARTER
     That's not what I was talking about.

     THOR
     Everything that can be done, has been done. The final attempt to
     solve our physiological degeneration has left each of us with a
     rapidly progressing disease.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1 minus Carter talks to Landry at the briefing table.]

     DANIEL
     It really wasn't an option for them. They made the choice to extend
     their life through science generations ago. Took any natural
     physiological evolution necessary for ascension out of the equation.

     LANDRY
     They're planning on ending their lives before the degeneration
     they're suffering from goes too far.

     MITCHELL
     Mass suicide.

     DANIEL
     They don't want any of their knowledge or technology falling into
     the wrong hands.

     LANDRY
     And they wanted us to witness the event.

     TEAL'C
     So, everything they've installed on this ship...

     DANIEL
     Is going to be their legacy.

   [Landry nods, and they all exchange somber looks.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Thor and Carter continue working; the large Asgard display screen
   shows a schematic.]

     THOR
     If you like, you'll be able to interface with the core using a
     holographic representation of me, or any other Asgard on record in
     the knowledge base.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, but that just won't be the same.

     THOR

     (somewhat hurt)
     I have been working on this for the better part of a year, Colonel
     Carter.

     CARTER
     And we appreciate it, really!

     THOR
     Many on the Council did not believe we should be imparting such
     advancements.

     CARTER
     Well, I promise we will do our very best not to let you down.

     THOR
     You are the Fifth Race. Your role is clear. If there is any hope in
     preserving the future, it lies with you and your people.

     CARTER
     No pressure, huh?

     THOR
     You have earned my respect and my friendship.

     CARTER
     Well, the feeling's mutual.

     THOR
     Please do not be sad. The end of my people has been a long time
     coming. We have made too many irreversible mistakes in our
     development. Hopefully, you can learn something from it. My only
     regret is that our physical weakness has left us incapable of
     helping you further.

   [Moved by his words, Carter hugs Thor.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Klaxons are sounding an alarm. Landry enters the bridge and sits in
   the command chair.]

     MARKS
     Sir, three Ori motherships just dropped out of hyperspace and are
     approaching the planet.

   [The Odyssey is rocked by a blast.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is already alerted by the rocking of the ship.]

     LANDRY

     (over intercom)
     Colonel, this is the bridge. We have three contacts. Ori motherships
     bearing down.

   [She rushes from the Asgard console to the Odyssey console.]

     CARTER

     (into intercom)
     Sir, the hyperdrive is still offline. Diverting power to the
     shields.

     THOR
     We must go.

   [Thor beams away just after Carter turns to face him.]

     CARTER

     (into intercom)
     Sir, the Asgard just disembarked. It'll take a few minutes to get
     the hyperdrive back online.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     LANDRY
     Full sub-light. Get us clear of the planet.

     MARKS
     Full sub-light.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey moves swiftly away from Orilla. One Ori mothership pursues it,
   firing on it, while the other two descend toward the planet.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [The ship is rocked again. Mitchell and Teal'c make their way onto the
   bridge.]

     MARKS
     Shields are down to eighty-three percent.

     MITCHELL
     How the hell did they find us?

   [There is another blast.]

     MITCHELL
     Some reason we're not jumping to hyperspace?

     LANDRY
     Carter's working on it.

     MARKS
     Sir? Sensors are detecting a massive build up of energy coming from
     the planet.

     LANDRY

     (steeling himself in his chair)
     Everyone hold on tight!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey and the Ori ship move away from the planet. The surface of
   Orilla suddenly erupts with huge explosions. After a moment, the entire
   planet explodes, and a huge shockwave moves out through space.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is rocked as she works on the hyperdrive.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [The shockwave from Orilla hits the ship.]

     MARKS
     Shields are down to fifty percent.

     LANDRY

     (into comm system)
     Colonel!

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER

     (into intercom)
     Sir, the hyperdrive is now online, but we have to get clear of the
     radiation caused by the explosion before we can make the jump
     safely.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     LANDRY
     How about the Asgard energy weapons?

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER
     They haven't been tested yet, sir.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Shields are down to twenty-eight percent. At maximum sub-light,
     we're forty-seven seconds to get clear.

     MITCHELL
     We're not gonna make it.

     LANDRY
     Let's see what these new Asgard upgrades are made of. Come about.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Odyssey begins a 180-degree turn back toward the Ori ship, which
   is still firing on it.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     LANDRY
     Power the energy weapons!

     MARKS
     Energy weapons are powered.

     LANDRY
     Fire!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey fires on the Ori warship with blue-beamed energy weapons. The
   beams cause the Ori ship's shields to become visible.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Sensors indicate enemy shields are fluctuating.

     LANDRY
     Keep firing!

   EXT--SPACE

   [After one more shot from the Odyssey, the weapon breaks through the
   shield, and the Ori warship explodes in a huge fireball.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry and Marks flinch at the sight of the blast, then Landry appears
   satisfied.]

     LANDRY
     I'll be damned!

     MITCHELL
     We got 'em.

     LANDRY
     Get us into hyperspace.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   [Landry smiles at Mitchell.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey moves through hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Carter exits the elevator while speaking to a technician.]

     CARTER

     (to technician)
     Run another diagnostic of the data.

   [Landry walks up to her, then they turn and begin walking.]

     LANDRY
     Colonel, how's that report coming? I want to be able to brief the
     President as soon as we get back. He's gonna want to know how
     quickly we can duplicate this new Asgard weaponry.

     CARTER
     I'm working on it, sir, but something else has come up. The
     hyperdrive diagnostic is spitting out some data that's concerning
     me.

     LANDRY
     We took some damage that's causing a problem?

     CARTER
     I think we need to drop out and run a few tests, just to be sure.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey drops out of hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry is in the command chair once again.]

     MARKS
     Sir? Two contacts just appeared on sensors. Motherships. Ori.
     Closing fast.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two Ori ships move toward Odyssey.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     LANDRY

     (into intercom)
     Colonel, given we've already taken damage, I'd rather not take on
     two more ships.

   [The ship is rocked by blasts.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter runs to the regular console and starts making inputs.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     CARTER

     (over intercom)
     Sir, the hyperdrive is back on-line.

     LANDRY

     (intensely)
     Get us back into hyperspace.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey jumps to hyperspace as the Ori ships fire on it.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM

   [SG-1 and Landry are there, Mitchell and Carter just taking their
   seats.]

     MITCHELL
     It's a hell of a coincidence, don't you think?

     CARTER
     Well, unless they were tracking us and just waiting for us to drop
     out.

     LANDRY
     I thought they couldn't track us in hyperspace.

     VALA
     Unless it was the Ori themselves, tipping off the Priors.

     DANIEL
     We've already passed back into the Milky Way. As far as we know, the
     Ancients should have a problem with the Ori using their ascended
     powers right under their noses.

     CARTER
     As far as we know.

     MITCHELL
     At least we now have weapons we know will destroy an Ori ship.

     CARTER
     Well that's not gonna do us any good if they can track us wherever
     we go. I mean eventually, the Odyssey's gonna come up against more
     than she can handle.

     TEAL'C
     Is it possible the Priors can detect the new technology given to us
     by the Asgard without the help of the Ori?

     CARTER
     I suppose the new power source could be giving off some sort of
     unique energy signature that's detectable from sub-space. However
     without further experimentation, the only way to find out is to shut
     it off and see if that stops the Ori from following us.

     LANDRY
     Do it.

     CARTER
     The problem with that, sir, is that the new Asgard core is currently
     tied into every system on this ship. We would have to drop out of
     hyperspace and isolate the core from the hyperdrive controls, and
     that could take some time.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey drops out of hyperspace.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry arrives hurriedly to the bridge.]

     MARKS
     Sir, two contacts just appeared on sensors.

     LANDRY
     Son of a bitch.

   [Mitchell, Daniel, and Teal'c have arrived on the bridge. An Ori hit
   shakes the ship hard.]

     MARKS
     Shields are down to fifty-three percent! Reports of damage, front
     and rear, Levels 2, 6 and 10.

     LANDRY
     Evasive maneuvers! Fire at will!

     MITCHELL
     We already took out one ship, what's another two, right?

     LANDRY

     (into intercom)
     Colonel, I need the hyperdrive, now!

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter makes some changes using the Asgard control console, moving the
   Asgard mouse-like device. Vala watches Carter.]

     CARTER
     Go ahead, sir. Hyperdrive's on-line.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry watches Marks activate the hyperdrive.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Odyssey leaps into hyperspace, leaving the Ori ships behind.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry and the rest of SG-1 enter.]

     CARTER
     We're gonna need at least half an hour to get the hyperdrive system
     separated from the core.

     TEAL'C
     We must assume the Ori ships will continue to engage us whenever we
     stop.

     LANDRY
     Is there a planet with a Stargate nearby?

     CARTER

     (at the control panel)
     Yes, sir: P3X-474. It's uninhabited. We should get there in just
     under an hour. We might make it before the hyperdrive fails.

     DANIEL

     (sensing trouble)
     And what?

     MITCHELL

     (matter-of-factly)
     Beam to the surface and gate home.

     CARTER
     We can't let this ship fall into enemy hands.

     LANDRY
     That's what the self-destruct is for.

     DANIEL

     (strenuously)
     Whoa, wait a minute, sir. If-if you're talking about destroying this
     ship... We can't sacrifice the knowledge base of the Asgard. They
     trusted us with their legacy.

     LANDRY

     Doctor Jackson, this is not something I'm considering lightly.

     (to Carter)
     I'm assuming we can't take any of it with us.

     CARTER
     No, sir. The core is too big to fit through the gate.

     DANIEL

     (disbelieving, insistent)
     Well, I for one am willing to stay and put up a fight! I think it's
     worth it.

     LANDRY
     Get us to '474. We'll beam the crew down to the surface. Hopefully
     there'll be enough time for them to gate home before the Ori attack.

     MITCHELL
     And then what? I've said it before, I am for fighting to the death,
     but we need a plan, preferably one that avoids the 'to the death'
     part.

     LANDRY
     We have an hour to come up with one.

     CARTER
     I think I may have a way of buying us a little more time.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE P3X-474

   [Odyssey exits hyperspace near the planet.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ROOM

   [A group of crew-members beams out of the ship.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Another group beams out, leaving Landry, Mitchell, and Daniel manning
   the command stations, Mitchell in Marks' usual station, Daniel in the
   other. Teal'c is standing in the rear of the bridge where he can access
   ship control panels.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE P3X-474

   [The two Ori warships exit hyperspace nearby.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     DANIEL
     Here they come!

     LANDRY
     Shields at maximum. Evasive maneuvers. Concentrate fire on only one
     target, one at a time.

   [Mitchell nods and makes commands on his console. The ship is struck
   and jolted by weapons fire.]

     MITCHELL
     Okay, that was not good.

   [Teal'c examines the control panel in the ceiling.]

     DANIEL
     Shields are down to twenty-three percent!

     MITCHELL
     We're hitting it with everything we've got!

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE P3X-474

   [Odyssey swoops down on one of the much larger Ori ships, firing all
   the way in. After being hit in numerous places, the Ori ship explodes.
   Odyssey moves away, but is immediately hit by blasts from the other
   ship.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Daniel and the others are thrown around, nearly out of their chairs.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter and Vala are thrown around as well.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [A fire has broken out behind Daniel's chair. Teal'c gets a fire
   extinguisher and activates it at the fire.]

     DANIEL
     Shields are off-line!

     MITCHELL
     One more hit will take us out!

     LANDRY
     Colonel Carter!

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter gets up off the floor, makes her way to the Asgard control
   console, and activates something on it.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE P3X-474

   [The Ori warship fires on Odyssey once more. The beam makes its way to
   Odyssey but then stops in mid-space before reaching its target.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [All is quiet on the bridge. Mitchell gets up and stares in shock out
   the forward view screen.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE P3X-474

   [Odyssey sits still in space, and the Ori weapons beam is frozen as
   well.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter is briefing the rest of SG-1 and Landry, using the small
   display screen on the wall.]

     CARTER
     So thanks to Asgard technology, we are in a time dilation bubble.
     While time may appear to be passing at a normal rate for us, in fact
     years will pass inside the bubble while mere fractions of a second
     pass outside the field.

     LANDRY
     You won't need that much time, though.

     CARTER
     Hopefully not. My plan is to try and make the necessary
     modifications to the Odyssey so we can take it out of phase. Then,
     when we shut down the time dilation field, the blast won't hit us.

     DANIEL
     That would be good.

     CARTER
     You're probably wondering why I just didn't do that in the first
     place.

     MITCHELL
     I'm still back on the "time thing."

     CARTER
     The Asgard core has time dilation field technology built right into
     it. It was a quick and easy option. I'm actually gonna have to
     recreate some of Merlin's out-of-phase technology from scratch with
     what we have on-board. And it could take a while.

     DANIEL
     Just to be sure, how long is a-a while in our time?

     CARTER
     I'm not exactly sure. But we have enough food and water for three
     months.

   [Everyone looks at her in shock at the prospect.]

     VALA

     (shocked)
     Three months.

     LANDRY
     We can ration supplies.

     VALA

     (whispering in Daniel's ear)
     I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm taking you with me.

   [Daniel sighs and grimaces.]

     CARTER
     Of course, if it takes a little longer...

     MITCHELL
     Oh, whoa. Longer than three months.

     LANDRY

     (standing)
     Bottom line is, none of you are going to have an excuse for being
     behind on your paperwork.

   [Landry walks out. Vala laughs nervously then stops. Carter grimaces
   and bounces on her feet for a moment.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Dressed in sweatpants and a sleeveless tee-shirt, Mitchell takes a run
   through the corridors.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter works at the Asgard console with a holographic Thor standing
   beside her.]

     HOLOGRAPHIC THOR
     That function is not possible.

   [Carter tries something else.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell keeps running.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry looks out the forward viewscreen.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell is still jogging, but more slowly.]

   INT--ODYSSEY PROJECTION ROOM

   [Daniel enters a large, long room with a small Asgard console in the
   center. He walks up to the console and activates it. He is then
   surrounded by a cylindrically-shaped hologram covered with Asgard
   writing and figures. It turns slowly around him.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Now wearing a sweatshirt over his tee-shirt, Mitchell runs.]

   INT--ODYSSEY SUPPLY ROOM

   [Vala and Teal'c are in the supply room. The room has metal shelves
   full of food, including huge cans of tomatoes. Teal'c moves a blue
   plastic bin of fresh vegetables from a stack onto one of the shelves.
   Vala is keeping an inventory on a clipboard.]

     VALA
     Do you think the Ori warriors could have found a way to get through
     the time dilation field and over here onto the ship?

     TEAL'C
     No.

     VALA
     'Cause I'm hearing things all the time. Are you hearing things?

     TEAL'C
     I am trying not to.

     VALA
     Maybe they found a way to ring over, but they can't figure out how
     to secretly shut off the time dilation field, so they're trying to
     drive us crazy and make us shut it down ourselves.

     TEAL'C
     No.

     VALA
     That wasn't a question.

     TEAL'C

     (annoyed)
     No.

   [Teal'c puts the last of the plastic bins onto the shelves.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter is explaining her status to the others; she is wearing civilian
   clothing.]

     CARTER
     Before I tried to build Merlin's out-of-phase technology, I decided
     to run a simulation.

   [She activates the simulation on the Asgard screen. It shows the Ori
   beam hitting the Odyssey and destroying it.]

     MITCHELL
     Are you saying it took two weeks to figure out this idea wouldn't
     work?

     CARTER
     I'm sorry. I've been trying to adjust the parameters. Now the
     problem is, according to Thor, I can't seem to take this ship out of
     phase before I shut down the field. And once we deactivate the time
     dilation field, we have point eight six seconds before the blast
     hits us. And that just isn't enough time to take the ship out of
     phase.

     MITCHELL
     Okay, time for Plan B.

     CARTER
     Actually, I ran that simulation, too.

   [She sets up the simulation.]

     CARTER

     If we beam ourselves into the buffer, ready to transport down to the
     planet and set the time dilation field to deactivate on a timer,
     (activating simulation)
     the matter stream still doesn't have enough time to fully exit the
     buffer and get clear of the explosion.

   [The simulation shows the ship being destroyed again.]

     MITCHELL

     (growing more intense)
     Fine, Plan C: we go to the 302s. That's how I got off the Korolev.

     CARTER
     I ran that, too. Based on the way the Odyssey is going to be hit
     compared to the 'Korolev, it won't work.

     MITCHELL
     The computer's wrong.

   [Carter sighs and grits her teeth in frustration.]

     DANIEL
     Both of the last two scenarios don't preserve the ship or the Asgard
     knowledge.

     CARTER

     (discouraged)
     I know.

     LANDRY
     Okay, it's only been a couple of weeks.

   [Vala is shown to be wearing a purple tee-shirt under her BDU jacket.
   The shirt has a stone-encrusted "V" pin on it.]

     VALA
     I have a problem with the word "only."

     CARTER
     The good news is, the Asgard have provided us with some truly
     amazing technology.

     MITCHELL
     Just nothing to get us out of this mess!

     CARTER
     I don't know that yet. However, with only a slight modification to
     the beaming technology, we have a matter converter that will
     literally allow us to manufacture food, water, oxygen, pretty much
     anything we need.

     MITCHELL
     Except a way off this ship!

     LANDRY
     You've made your point, son. I doubt very much Colonel Carter has
     even scratched the surface of what's possible. Let's give her some
     more time.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The beam is still stopped within the time dilation field.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDORS

   [The corridors are eerily empty and silent.]

   INT--VALA'S QUARTERS

   [Vala lies in her bed, which has plum and light-blue bedding. She
   tosses and turns, unable to get to sleep.]

   INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF DANIEL'S QUARTERS

   [The doors to Daniel's quarters slide open, revealing Vala standing
   there, dressed in silky pink and black lingerie and holding matching
   padded cufflinks, which she holds up suggestively. Daniel takes one
   look at her and activate the door-closing mechanism without saying a
   word.]

   INT--ODYSSEY GYM

   [Mitchell and Teal'c spar with the Sodan sticks. Mitchell is very
   aggressive and after several parries gets the upper hand on Teal'c.
   Teal'c appears surprised, while Mitchell looks angry but satisfied. He
   walks away with a large abrasion on his left upper arm.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter uses the Asgard technology to materialize a cello, which beams
   into the room. She turns and smiles at it.]

   INT--ODYSSEY PROJECTION ROOM

   [Daniel is surrounded by the Asgard runes on the hologram. Seemingly
   saddened by what he sees, he walks to the pedestal and shuts down the
   program, then leaves the room.]

   INT--DANIEL'S QUARTERS

   [The room has some shelves with a few books on them, as well as a
   chair, desk, bed. Daniel paces in front of a bookshelf while Vala sits
   on the bed, listening.]

     DANIEL

     I mean, all they wanted to do was live a little longer. We're no
     different. Sequence DNA. Cure diseases. One fatal mistake, and they
     doom their entire race.

     (contemplatively)
     I guess no matter what you do, at the end of the day...life is too
     short.

     VALA

     (quietly)
     I agree.

   [Daniel turns away from her to rest one arm on top of the bookshelf. He
   takes off his glasses with his other hand and rubs his eye. Vala stands
   up and pulls her sweater off over her head just as Daniel turns back to
   her, putting his glasses back on. He sees she is now wearing only a
   camisole-style top.]

     DANIEL
     What are you doing?

     VALA
     Something we should have done a long time ago.

   [She walks over to him, grabs his belt buckle, and unbuckles it.]

     DANIEL
     Don't do that.

     VALA

     (laughing)
     Why not?

   [She starts to unbutton his BDU pants. He takes her hands and holds
   them for a moment, then pushes her away, a stern expression on his
   face. He turns away from her dismissively.]

     VALA
     We've been here three months, Daniel. Three months!... You do like
     girls?

   [Daniel has re-buckled his belt.]

     DANIEL

     (assertively)
     Yes!

     VALA
     Oh. Well, I don't see many other options around here, do you?

   [She motions around the ship. He crosses his arms, unmoved.]

     VALA

     (somberly, realizing)
     Unless...you really...don't find me attractive.

     DANIEL
     Do you want an honest answer to that question?

     VALA

     (scared)
     No.

     DANIEL

     (approaching her, speaking more loudly)
     No seriously, you started this! Do you want an honest answer to the
     question?

   [She turns away from him and picks up her sweater as if to put it back
   on.]

     VALA
     No, don't worry about it.

     DANIEL
     Do you believe I could have any kind of serious feelings for you?

   [He raises his eyebrows, waiting for an answer. She turns around to
   face him.]

     VALA
     I wasn't suggesting you have serious feelings, Daniel.

     DANIEL

     Oh! Oh, what, so what-what, we sleep together once, then what?

     (emphatic, gesturing with his hands)
     We work together! And you know, even saying that part out loud
     sounds unbelievable.

   [He steps away, smiling and laughing at the absurdity.]

     DANIEL
     I mean...come on! I mean, I can't even imagine what a--what a
     relationship with you would be like!

   [By now she has turned away from him again and is sitting on the end of
   the bed, her sweater in her hand. She has begun to cry.]

     DANIEL

     (a bit calmer, approaching her again)
     I mean, yes, yes, you've proven yourself to be...trustworthy on a
     professional level, and for that I am very proud of you, but on a
     personal level?
     (challenging)
     Vala, come on, give me a break!

   [Vala cries, still not facing him.]

     DANIEL

     I mean, at best, you're an emotional, unstable wreck! I'm not saying
     I'm much better. I'm not saying I'm much better. (stepping away
     again)
     There was a time when I thought I would never get over my wife. I
     mean, the idea of...being hurt that way again. But I've finally
     gotten to the place. I've finally, for the first time in a long
     time, have gotten to the place where I actually feel I could get
     close to somebody again.

     (very emphatic)
     But not in a million years, a million, million years, would I ever
     possibly consider that person being you! I mean, we are so
     completely opposite and wrong for each other, it's not even funny!
     And the worst part, the worst part about that is, you know that!
     (gesturing, moving his hands around his chest)
     And this whole flirty sexual thing that you do, that's just your way
     of having a laugh at my expense. So I'm so sorry if I'm not more
     appreciative of that and I'm so sorry that you're bored. But don't
     you pretend it's anything else!

   [She nods her head slightly but doesn't look at him. He sighs and steps
   over to the book shelf, putting his arms on top of it. She begins to
   wipe the tears from her face.]

     DANIEL
     Don't act like you're hurt.

   [She huffs out a breath, trying to laugh, and starts to put on the
   sweater. Daniel rolls his eyes. She puts the sweater on. Daniel looks
   at her, able to see her profile now. He walks over and sits next to her
   on the bed. She turns away from him as if embarrassed and adjusts her
   sweater. He touches her on the back.]

     DANIEL
     Hey.

   [She puts her hands over her face.]

     VALA
     Just give me a minute.

     DANIEL
     Look at me.

   [She keeps her hands covering her face. He pulls back her hair gently.
   She lowers her hands and looks at him. He has a look of serious
   realization. She looks away. He puts his hand on her face and turns it
   toward him. He rubs her cheek with his thumb. With a serious
   expression, he kisses her, and she kisses back. They stop after a
   moment.]

     DANIEL

     (smiling)
     You better not be messing with me.

   [They begin kissing again, then fall over sideways onto the bed.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Vala comes out of Daniel's room, pulling her sweater on. Mitchell
   comes jogging by and stops when he sees Vala waving back at Daniel. She
   smiles at Mitchell, fluffs her hair, and walks the other way. Mitchell
   ponders what he has seen, confused, then sets off again.]

   INT--LANDRY'S QUARTERS

   [Dressed in a tee-shirt and cardigan, Landry sprays a small plant with
   one hand while clipping it with a pair of scissors in the other. His
   door is open, and Mitchell enters.]

     MITCHELL
     General? We need to take our chances with the F-302s.

     LANDRY
     What I need is a sunlamp. This matter-converted oxygen just isn't
     the same.

   [He steps over to another plant.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, why is the grand irony of this lost on everyone but me?

     LANDRY
     It's not.

     MITCHELL
     Sir, at this point we know it's the damn Asgard upgrade that allows
     the Ori to track us. So even if we manage to save the ship, we won't
     be able to use the technology because the Ori will come down on us
     like a bag of hammers.

     LANDRY
     For now.

   [Landry continues tending to small plants.]

     MITCHELL
     Oh, come on, sir, It's like a bad joke! We have stranded ourselves
     here trying to save something we can't use.

     LANDRY
     I'm not having this conversation again.

   [He walks away with another plant as Mitchell stares angrily.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The situation has not changed.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry stands at the forward window, looking at the Ori beam frozen in
   place.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [Carter sits alone at a table, contemplative. Vala rushes in and sits
   across from her.]

     VALA
     I want to help you.

   [Carter smiles indulgently.]

   INT--ODYSSEY GYM

   [Teal'c and Mitchell spar.]

   INT--ODYSSEY PROJECTION ROOM

   [Daniel studies the Asgard writings, now with two concentric sets of
   displays.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Vala paces in front of Carter, who is sitting.]

     VALA
     The problem is that there isn't enough time to shut off the dilation
     field and start a new process.

     CARTER
     I know.

     VALA
     Uh, I'm just thinking out loud here.

     CARTER
     I know.

     VALA
     What is that thing?

   [Carter tuns to look at what Vala is referring to -- her cello.]

     CARTER
     Ah, it's a cello. I've always wanted to learn how to play.

     VALA

     (smiling)
     Huh.

     (pacing)
     Is it possible to use the time dilation technology to solve our
     problem?

     CARTER
     How?

     VALA
     Well, obviously it would--

   [She leans back against the Asgard console, causing a beeping noise.]

     CARTER
     Ah!

     VALA
     Sorry. Obviously it'd be great if we could go back in time and not
     get into this situation in the first place.

     CARTER

     (chuckling)
     Well, slowing down time within a localized field is not even close
     to the same thing as reversing time altogether. It's a good thought,
     though.

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [All of them are gathered for dinner. Mitchell holds up a salt shaker
   and a napkin.]

     MITCHELL

     (moving the shaker around his plate)
     See what we need is, we need Superman to fly around the ship really,
     really fast.

     CARTER
     Oh, if you only knew how ridiculous that was.

     MITCHELL
     No, it only sounds ridiculous 'til you hear yourself say "I am
     trapped on a spaceship stuck in a time dilation field."

   [He gets up, takes his tray, and leaves.]

   BEGIN MONTAGE

   [Following is a montage of scenes set to the song Have You Ever Seen
   the Rain by Creedence Clearwater Revival.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A window in the side of the ship reveals Carter playing the cello in
   her quarters.]

   INT--LANDRY'S QUARTERS

   [His quarters are now filled with plants, which he tends to.]

   INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell jogs through the corridor and encounters Vala on roller
   skates. She turns around completely then continues.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [Everyone is laughing as they share a meal.]

   INT--ODYSSEY HANGAR BAY

   [Mitchell sits alone in an F-302.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter activates the matter converter. Three vials of tretonin appear.
   Teal'c takes one and injects the contents into his forearm.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry looks out of the forward viewscreen, then walks away.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [The room is decorated for Christmas, and the team is drinking wine and
   celebrating, laughing and smiling. Mitchell wears a red Santa hat. He
   stands up and leans across the table, holding a sprig of mistletoe over
   Carter. He kisses her. Vala sits on Daniel's lap and opens a present.
   Mitchell kisses Vala too.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter tries something on her laptop.]

     HOLOGRAPHIC THOR
     That function is not possible.

   INT--LANDRY'S QUARTERS

   [Landry and Mitchell play chess.]

     MITCHELL
     I hate this ship.

     LANDRY
     You're a pilot. You love flying.

     MITCHELL
     In fighters. This is not flying, this is literally standing still.
     This is the "Loveboat," without the buffet and the band. Besides, I
     only liked flying so much 'cause I didn't know about the Stargate.

   INT--DANIEL AND VALA'S QUARTERS

   [Daniel and Vala sit on the floor at the foot of the bed. Vala is
   crying and moving anxiously. Daniel holds her, trying to comfort her.]

   INT--MITCHELL'S QUARTER

   [The room has hand-weights, some open shelving, and several model
   airplanes. Mitchell sits at the foot of the bed, holding a football. He
   throws the football at one of the models, breaking it. He walks over to
   the shelf and throws the broken model into a small trash can. He throws
   the trash can across the room, then begins throwing the shelves to the
   floor. Yelling, he upends the bed and throws everything around until
   it's done. Then he leans over, breathing hard.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [The six sit at the dining table, but they are all subdued and unhappy,
   not looking at one another.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter again tries something on her laptop.]

     HOLOGRAPHIC THOR
     That function is not possible.

   [Carter hits a key to turn the Thor hologram off, then smiles falsely
   and returns to her laptop.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry looks out of the forward viewscreen, contemplative.]

   END MONTAGE

   EXT--SPACE

   [In several steps, the beam moves closer to the ship.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Landry stands on the bridge, clearly much older. His hair is long and
   white. He coughs weakly.]

   INT--CARTER'S QUARTERS

   [Carter plays a solo on the cello in a very accomplished way.]

   INT--DANIEL AND VALA'S QUARTERS

   [Daniel and Vala lie in bed together, her arm across his chest. They
   are both older, and his hair is gray.]

     DANIEL
     Twenty years today.

     VALA
     Still think life is too short?

   INT--CARTER'S QUARTERS

   [Carter plays the cello.]

   INT--LANDRY'S QUARTERS

   [Mitchell and Landry play chess. Mitchell wears a flight suit and has
   short hair. Landry has a coughing fit. Mitchell reaches for him, but
   Landry stands up and moves away.]

   INT--CARTER'S QUARTERS

   [Carter plays the cello. Her hair is now long and mostly gray.]

   INT--ODYSSEY PROJECTION ROOM

   [Daniel is studying the Asgard writings when Carter stops at the
   doorway and leans against the door frame.]

     CARTER
     Hey.

     DANIEL

     (not turning to her)
     Hey.

   [She steps inside.]

     CARTER
     Why do you do it? Knowing everything you learn is gonna die with
     you?

   [He smiles and walks back toward her, to the podium. He picks up an
   Asgard device.]

     DANIEL
     I know you guys all think I'm crazy, but...the truth is, if I stop,
     I'll go crazy. Besides, you haven't given up.

   [As he talks, he picks up several of the devices and looks at them, one
   at a time.]

     CARTER
     Yes, I have.

   [They exchange sad looks, then Daniel sighs and looks back down at the
   Asgard console, setting down what he was holding.]

   INT--ODYSSEY INFIRMARY

   [Landry lies in an infirmary bed, monitors behind it, a medical cart on
   one side, and a large plant on the other. Breathing very roughly, he is
   clearly on the verge of dying. Carter sits beside his bed, crying.]

     LANDRY
     Stop it.

     CARTER
     I can't. I'm sorry.

     LANDRY
     It wasn't your fault. We all would have died long ago if you hadn't
     done what you did.

   [He takes her hand.]

     LANDRY
     Don't give up.

   [She cries but nods her head in agreement.]

   LATER

   [She leaves the room and finds Teal'c standing in the corridor, waiting
   for her. They hug as she cries.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [SG-1 are gathered at the table, grieving. Mitchell touches Carter on
   the shoulder, then sits down.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The beam moves even closer to the ship.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Now very old, Mitchell looks out the forward viewscreen at the
   approaching beam, hums a little, then turns away.]

   INT--ODYSSEY DINING ROOM

   [Mitchell enters to find the others eating in silence. They are all
   much older now as well. All but Teal'c appear to be in their 80s.
   Teal'c does not appear much older, but he has a large gray patch of
   hair on the right side of his head.]

     MITCHELL
     When I said that I wanted to get the team back together, work with
     you guys, learn from you...

   [He sits down at his tray of food.]

     MITCHELL
     I did not mean every waking moment for the next fifty years.

     DANIEL
     You said that yesterday.

     MITCHELL
     I did?

     TEAL'C
     And the day before.

     VALA
     And the day before that.

     MITCHELL
     Oh, sorry. I'll just...shut up now.

     DANIEL
     No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

   [They continue eating.]

     CARTER
     I did it.

     MITCHELL
     You did what?

     CARTER

     (without enthusiasm)
     I figured out how to reverse time in a localized field.

   [They all stop eating and stare.]

     DANIEL
     What?

     VALA
     What's the matter?

     CARTER
     Maintaining the time dilation field for all this time has almost
     completely depleted the ZPM, and the power source in the Asgard
     core.

     MITCHELL
     We don't have enough power to make it work.

     CARTER
     Mmmm. There's irony for you, huh?

   [Mitchell stands up with a disgusted hand wave and goes to stand at the
   window.]

     CARTER
     I create the field to buy us more time. I finally figure out how to
     undo it all, and that extra time is what makes it impossible.

     DANIEL
     Are you sure? I mean, if you had some more time, could you--

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     I'm sure.

     MITCHELL
     Hey, Sam. Do you remember when we were stuck out of phase?

     CARTER
     Which time?

     MITCHELL
     When you got shot and you thought you were gonna die, and the Ori
     were gonna destroy that village.

     CARTER
     Vaguely.

     MITCHELL
     You had me use the power source from an Ori staff weapon to power
     Merlin's device.

     CARTER
     We don't have anything even close to a power source that would be
     required to keep a reverse time-field working for long enough.

     MITCHELL
     Really.

   [He walks over to her and holds out his hand for her to take.]

     MITCHELL
     Come with me.

   [She looks up in curiosity, takes his hand, and walks over to the
   window with him.]

     MITCHELL

     (pointing to the Ori energy beam)
     What about that?

     CARTER
     That? There's no way we...

   [She tilts her head as if realizing a new possibility.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter briefs the others in front of the Asgard display panel.]

     CARTER
     There's no way to absorb the blast and channel the energy into the
     Asgard core.

     MITCHELL
     Unless...

     CARTER
     Unless we reroute the power conduits throughout the ship into the
     core, and let the blast hit us.

     VALA
     This ship will explode.

     CARTER
     Yes. But hopefully, enough energy from the blast will be channeled
     into the core to allow it to activate the reverse time-field before
     everything is totally destroyed.

     VALA
     But we'll all be dead.

     CARTER
     If this works, we'll only be dead for a few milliseconds... And time
     within the bubble will reverse, and we won't be dead, and the ship
     won't be destroyed.

     MITCHELL
     If this works.

     CARTER
     Yes. I'm not promising anything.

     MITCHELL
     It's all right, it's a shot... And I say we take it.

     VALA
     How far back can we go?

     CARTER
     Only to the point where the time dilation field was created. We
     can't reverse time for the entire universe. If we go back any
     further than that, we are outside of normal time-space again and we
     create a paradox that the technology couldn't handle.

     DANIEL
     Is that going to be good enough?

     CARTER
     I might be able to buy us a little more time, maybe a minute.
     But...one of us is gonna have to stay old.

     DANIEL
     Oh.

     MITCHELL
     Oh.

     CARTER
     We're talking about reversing time within the field. Everything: our
     age, our memories, will be undone.

     DANIEL
     If this works, we'll be doomed to repeat history.

     CARTER
     Unless we can exclude someone from the field who can steer events in
     another direction.

     MITCHELL
     You created the time dilation field to prevent us from being hit by
     that blast in the first place. You had no choice.

     CARTER
     Right! We have to sever the Asgard core from the hyperdrive
     controls, or else the Ori will be able to follow us when we make the
     jump into hyperspace. A long time ago, in the event that I ever did
     solve the time issue, I created a program that would achieve that
     very quickly. I'll load it onto a crystal. That way, it will only
     take me a few seconds to shut down the core and make the jump into
     hyperspace.

     MITCHELL
     Who says it's gonna be you?

     CARTER
     Well, it makes sense that it be me.

     MITCHELL

     (disagreeing)
     Ah.

     TEAL'C
     I will do it.

   [Everyone turns to face him.]

     DANIEL
     Teal'c, you've lost as many years as the rest of us.

     MITCHELL
     What are you, a hundred and thirty now?

     VALA
     I don't know, he doesn't look a day over one twenty to me.

     TEAL'C
     I have many more years to live. I am the only logical choice.

     CARTER
     Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     I have but one question. If this should not work...

     CARTER
     Then the shields will fail, and you will die along with the rest of
     us.

     TEAL'C
     Then it is settled.

   [Carter nods, and the others sit in silent assent.]

   INT--NEXT TO A WINDOW ON ODYSSEY

   [Daniel and Vala are alone.]

     DANIEL
     I want you to know, even if you are gonna forget, that I wasn't with
     you all these years because we were trapped on this god-awful ship.
     I was with you because--

     VALA
     I know. And I want you to know that I--

     DANIEL
     I know. I know.

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Mitchell looks out the viewscreen.]

     CARTER

     (over intercom)
     I'm ready.

     MITCHELL
     Do it, Sam.

   INT--LARGE ROOM ON ODYSSEY

   [Teal'c squeezes the Asgard device he is holding. On Carter's command,
   a field forms around him, preventing him from going backward in time.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter pushes the control device across the Asgard console; it lights
   up.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The time dilation field is now off. The Ori beam goes through Odyssey,
   breaking it apart and causing large explosions.]

   INT--LARGE ROOM ON ODYSSEY

   [Teal'c stands in the middle of the room as it explodes around him, one
   set of windows after another.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ships is completely engulfed in explosions, breaking apart.
   Suddenly all motion stops, then time starts to move backward as the
   explosion undoes itself to the point where the Ori weapons struck the
   ship.]

   INT--LARGE ROOM ON ODYSSEY

   [The explosion undoes itself around Teal'c, who still stands within the
   special field.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

   [Time has reversed fifty years, back to the moments before the final
   shot from the Ori ship. Daniel is again at one of the control
   consoles.]

   [Daniel is thrown nearly out of his chair by a blast.]

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter and Vala are thrown around as well.]

   INT--ODYSSEY BRIDGE

     DANIEL
     Shields are off-line!

     MITCHELL
     One more hit will take us out!

     LANDRY
     Colonel Carter!

   INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter gets up from the floor and makes her way to the Asgard console.
   She is about to activate the time dilation field, but Teal'c grabs her
   hand, stopping her.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c, what are you doing?

   [Teal's looks at her with a fierce expression.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Ori ship fires, but Odyssey is already maneuvering away. Odyssey
   jumps to hyperspace.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC, TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

   [Teal'c and Vala are there. Teal'c moves around the room, blowing out
   candles, as Vala speaks, pacing and animated.]

     VALA
     Oh, come on, it's driving me insane! You know, technically, there
     would be no danger of creating a time paradox, because we've already
     changed future events. You would not be altering the future by
     telling us about something that's not gonna happen anymore!

     TEAL'C
     Then why do you care?

     VALA
     Fifty or sixty years? Something interesting must have happened.
     Obviously I hooked up with someone.

   [Teal'c smiles enigmatically as he blows out another candle.]

     VALA
     Was it you, muscles? It can't have been Mitchell, can it? General
     Landry?

   [Teal'c heads out his door. Vala follows quickly.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Harriman mans his usual station. Landry enters from the stairway.]

     LANDRY
     Dial it up, Walter!

     HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate spins to the first chevron.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron one encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [SG-1 enters from the left entrance, geared up for a mission, dressed
   in green BDU's.]

     MITCHELL
     That is how we're supposed to travel light years across the galaxy
     to other planets.

   [He points at the gate.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron two encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     MITCHELL

     (to Teal'c)
     You know, I like to think that I handled myself well, but I imagine
     I went a bit crazy cooped up on that ship for so long.

   [Teal'c smiles but does not respond.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron three encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     DANIEL
     You know, Teal'c did tell me some things I learned from the Asgard
     knowledge base.

     VALA

     (very annoyed)
     He did? Like what?

     DANIEL

     (to himself)
     Oh boy, what were they...

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron four encoded.

     DANIEL
     Beggars can't be choosers. Better late than never. Look before you
     leap.

     MITCHELL
     The best things in life are free.

     VALA
     Let me guess: beauty is only skin deep?

     DANIEL
     Silence is golden.

   [Daniel looks pointedly at Vala, who smiles back.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over intercom)
     Chevron five encoded.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry watches the proceedings.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     MITCHELL
     Jack of all trades; master of none.

     CARTER
     Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

     VALA
     Life is too short.

   [Daniel looks sharply at Vala, and Mitchell smiles at her.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron six encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     TEAL'C
     Good things come to those who wait.

     CARTER
     You know, as hard as it is for us not knowing, it must be torture
     for you not to tell us.

     TEAL'C

     (moved)
     Indeed.

   [The gate moves to the symbol for Earth.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Harriman's computer shows the point of origin being added to the gate
   address.]

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron seven is locked.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The wormholes comes to life.]

     LANDRY
     Good luck, SG-1.

     MITCHELL
     Just another everyday mission to save the galaxy, sir.

     ALL OF SG-1 IN UNISON
     Indeed.

     LANDRY
     God speed.

   [Smiling, they all turn and walk up the ramp and into the wormhole.]

   FADE OUT
