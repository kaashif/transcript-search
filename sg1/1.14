   TEASER

   EXT--EST. SHOT OF MAYAN PYRAMID

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER OF PYRAMID

   [It's pitch black. There are unidentified voices, and a pounding sound,
   like metal on rock.]

     VOICES
     We're almost there. Okay, now. Push it. Push!

   [A square of light is revealed as a piece of stone falls. Flashlight
   beams cross in the darkness, then three people come down stone steps.]

     DR KLEINHOUSE
     Would you look at this! Many of us suspected there was another
     chamber, but the Mexican government wouldn't let us dig the
     compartment...'til now.

   [The flashlight beam falls on a large, golden shape, the only thing in
   the chamber.]

     DR COLE
     What's this? It looks like a sarcophagus.

     DR KLEINHOUSE

     Burial chambers in Mayan temple house are very rare indeed. Here.
     (Pulls out a brush)
     Look for glyphs, pictographs. Something to give us a hint who's
     inside.
     (He feels reveals pictures)
     Hieroglyphics.

     DR COLE

     (brushing more dust off the top, revealing the shapes beneath)
     My God. They're Egyptian. That doesn't make any sense. Egyptian
     hieroglyphics in a Mayan temple?

     DR KLEINHOUSE
     I read a journal article once by a young archaeologist. What was his
     name? Uh, Dr Jackson. Dr Daniel Jackson. He was laughed right out of
     academia for his preposterous ideas about a connection between
     various ancient civilizations.

     DR COLE
     Maybe Dr Jackson was onto something. I recognize one of these
     pictographs. It's of the goddess Hathor. The Egyptian goddess.

   [DR KLEINHOUSE brushes off more dust, revealing a glowing red stone in
   the top of the sarcophagus, similar to the center of a DHD. DR
   KLEINHOUSE places his palm on the stone, and twists it. There is a
   grinding sound, and the top of the sarcophagus shifts. DR COLE hides
   behind DR KLEINHOUSE. Slowly the top slides apart, a perfectly
   manicured hand reaches out, then a beautiful woman, clad in an Egyptian
   headdress sits up, her eyes running over the invaders.]

     HATHOR

     (In a deep Goa'uld voice)
     Where is Ra?

     DR KLEINHOUSE
     Uh, I...I assume you mean the god Ra?

     HATHOR

     (Looking displeased)
     You are not Goa'uld.

     DR KLEINHOUSE

     (Whispers to Dr Cole)
     What's that?

   [HATHOR raises one hand, revealing a ribbon device on her palm. A red
   beam shoots of out it, and the archaeologists scream.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [DANIEL is standing on one side of the sarcophagus, HAMMOND and CARTER
   on the other. TEAL'C is at the far end, near the Stargate; O'NEILL in
   the background. DANIEL runs his hand over the gold glyphs.]

     DANIEL
     Dr Kleinhouse and his associates were killed brutally. The Mexican
     authorities assume it was by crypt robbers looking to steal anything
     in the burial vault. Like this.

     HAMMOND
     And who thought to send it here?

     DANIEL
     Uh, Dr Kleinhouse's other associates, who were outside the pyramid.
     They recognized the significance of an Egyptian sarcophagus in a
     Mayan temple. And, since I was the only one to ever do research in
     cross pollinization of ancient cultures, they tracked me down.

     O"NEILL
     I know this thing.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I recognize it too.

     O'NEILL
     It's like that thing that was on Ra's ship that...

     DANIEL
     (interupts him, nodding)...brought Sha're and I back from the dead.

     HAMMOND
     Well, how could it be?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. But if it does belong to a Goa'uld, it would explain a
     lot. Like why there's no one in it, and why it has Egyptian
     hieroglyphs on it instead of Mayan.

     AIRMAN

     (entering)
     General Hammond, sir.

     HAMMOND
     What is it, airman?

     AIRMAN
     Sir, a person was just arrested at the mountain surface for
     attempting an unauthorized entrance.

     HAMMOND
     Happens every now and then. Let the police handle him.

     AIRMAN
     It's a her, sir. Major Lowell thought you would want to talk to her
     yourself.

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     AIRMAN
     Sir, she knew the Stargate was here.

   END TEASER

   INT--SGC

   [HAMMOND is walking down the corridors, with DANIEL and O'NEILL behind
   him. They are obviously on their way to see this mysterious woman.]

     AIRMAN

     Sirs.
     (Salutes)

   [HAMMOND salutes in return. The Airman lets them into a holding cell.
   HATHOR, wearing an oversized trenchcoat, is standing beside the bunk,
   facing away from the door.]

     HAMMOND
     Ma'am. I'm General Hammond, U.S. Air Force.

     HATHOR

     Yes?
     (she turns)

     HAMMOND
     And you are?

     HATHOR

     We are Hathor.
     (We see that her arms are bound behind her)
     You would be wise to unbind us, and kneel before your goddess.

     O'NEILL
     Helll-o.

     DANIEL
     Hathor?

     HATHOR
     Yes.

     O'NEILL
     Have you heard of her?

     DANIEL
     Hathor was the Egyptian goddess of fertility, inebriety and music.

     O'NEILL
     Sex, drugs and rock and roll?

     DANIEL

     In a manner of speaking, yes.
     (To Hammond)
     Um, are the cuffs absolutely necessary?

   [HAMMOND and O'NEILL exchange a look, then HAMMOND raises a hand
   towards HATHOR, giving DANIEL permission to unbind her.]

     DANIEL

     (mutters)
     I'm surprised they didn't chain her to the bed too. What's she going
     to do, beat us up?
     (undoes handcuffs)

     (To Hathor)
     Sorry about that.

     HATHOR
     Thank you. Your efforts shall not go unrewarded.

   [HATHOR takes DANIEL'S hand and raises it, breathing on him. Pink mist
   leaves her mouth. DANIEL looks surprised, then stunned. HATHOR smiles.
   DANIEL backs away and sits abruptly on the bed.]

     HAMMOND
     So, Ms Hathor. Would you mind telling us why exactly you were trying
     to get into this facility?

     HATHOR
     We were drawn to the Chapa'ai.

     O'NEILL

     Chapa'ai?
     (To Daniel)
     That's what your monk buddies on Chulak call the Stargate.

     DANIEL

     (Shaking himself)
     Um, yes. It's also Abydonian and ancient Egyptian.

     HAMMOND
     What I want to know is what makes you think it's here, Ma'am?

     HATHOR

     (Testy)
     We were drawn to it.

     O'NEILL

     We?
     (Cocks one eyebrow, clearly humoring her.)

     HATHOR

     (To Daniel)
     Where is Ra?

     DANIEL
     Ra is...

     HAMMOND
     Dr Jackson. Need to know.

   [DANIEL looks confused for a moment, then pushes himself to his feet.]

     DANIEL
     Ra...Ra is a myth. He doesn't actually exist.

     O'NEILL
     Miss...Hathor. What made you think this Chapa'Ai was here?

     HATHOR
     The Chapa'Ai was what gave power to our father, and our husband.

     HAMMOND
     Who's she talking about, Dr Jackson?

     DANIEL
     Ummm, Hathor was both the daughter and wife of Ra in Egyptian
     mythology. Until Ra was said to have corrupted her.

     HATHOR

     (Angrily)
     We were not corrupted.

     DANIEL
     Of course. No disrespect intended.

     HATHOR
     We are the mother of all pharaohs.

     O'NEILL

     (Humoring her)
     Of course we are. General? Why don't we call county mental health
     and see if we can find a nice little rubber room for the lady?

     HAMMOND

     Crazy or not, I want to know what she knows. Dr Jackson, talk to
     her. See what you can find out. But don't tell her anything she
     doesn't already know.

     DANIEL
     (Nods)
     Okay.

   [HAMMOND and O'NEILL turn to leave the room.]

     HATHOR
     You--with the crown of marble.

   [Both men stop. O'NEILL looks at HAMMOND.]

     O'NEILL
     She might mean you, sir.

     HATHOR
     You are the ruler here?

     HAMMOND

     Yes, ma'am. HATHOR
     May we take your hand?

     HAMMOND

     (Suspiciously)
     Why?

     HATHOR
     We wish to kiss it. To bless you with fertility and joy.

     O'NEILL

     (Amused)
     Well, you can't pass that up sir.

     HAMMOND

     (Clearly NOT amused)
     Yes, I can.

     DANIEL
     Sir, it might help me if you play into her delusions. Just to keep
     her talking.

   [HAMMOND looks at O'NEILL, who shrugs. HAMMOND goes over to HATHOR, who
   takes his hand in her own and raises it to her mouth. She breathes pink
   mist onto the General's hand. HAMMOND looks stunned, then walks back to
   the door, turning to look back at HATHOR, who smirks. HAMMOND and
   O'NEILL leave.]

   [Once the door closes, HATHOR turns to DANIEL.]

     HATHOR
     Now. Where is Ra?

     DANIEL
     Ra, your husband?

     HATHOR

     (Eyes glowing, Goa'uld voice)
     Where. Is. Ra?

     DANIEL
     Um, I hate to be the one to tell you, but, Ra is dead.

     HATHOR

     (Frowns)
     How?

     DANIEL
     He was killed.

     HATHOR

     (Laughs)
     This is wonderful.

     DANIEL

     (Smiling tentatively)
     It is?

     HATHOR
     How did he die?

     DANIEL
     Uh...we killed him.

     HATHOR
     Then we owe your our gratitude indeed.

   [She circles DANIEL, with one hand on his shoulders. He looks bemused.]

     HATHOR
     Perhaps we should choose you to be our new beloved. Together, we
     shall celebrate.

   [HATHOR crosses the room and drops the trenchcoat, revealing an exotic
   Egyptian dress, with a gold halter top and orange/red skirt. Gold
   armbands with snakes coil around one upper arm.]

     HATHOR

     (Crooks her finger to DANIEL)
     Come.

   [DANIEL crosses the room in a daze, leaning down toward her. She looks
   up and more pink mist passes from her mouth. DANIEL breathes it in
   through his mouth and nose, then their lips join in a kiss.]

   INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM

   [The Gate room is visible through the window. O'NEILL is standing at
   that window. HAMMOND, TEAL'C and CARTER are behind him. Two airmen
   stand guard at the door.]

     O'NEILL

     Do we really think anyone is going to believe that woman if she goes
     around blabbing about a...
     (he raises his hands and makes air quotes)
     'Stargate'? I mean, I have a hard time believing this woman down on
     73rd who walks around talking about all these little...devil
     people...that live in her hair. Even though she could use a little
     conditioner.

     TEAL'C
     Is not the question how does she know of the Stargate?

     HAMMOND
     Dr Jackson's trying to figure that out now.

   [DANIEL enters, walking down the spiral staircase.]

     DANIEL
     I believe I have figured that out sir. She knows a hell of a lot.
     Either she's studied her Egyptian mythology very carefully, or...

     HAMMOND
     Or what, Dr Jackson?

     DANIEL
     Or she's actually lived it.

     HAMMOND
     Meaning?

     DANIEL
     She's a Goa'uld, sir.

     CARTER

     (Surprised)
     What?

     O'NEILL
     How is she a Goa'uld?

     TEAL'C
     She could not have come through the Stargate. We would have been
     alerted.

     DANIEL
     She's been imprisoned in stasis on Earth for almost two thousand
     years.

     O'NEILL

     (Raises his eyebrows in disbelief)
     Is...mental illness contagious?

     DANIEL

     (Ignoring O'Neill)
     General Hammond, I think she is Hathor. Or at least the Goa'uld that
     took on the persona of Hathor.

     CARTER
     Back up. Did you say she's a Goa'uld?

     DANIEL
     Yes. She feels indebted to us for killing Ra, who she was trying to
     stop from enslaving Earth. See, she's always been a friend of
     humanity. See, that's how it was in the Book of the Dead. Hathor was
     a much-loved goddess.

     HAMMOND
     Are you saying she wants to help us?

     DANIEL
     Yes. She wants to help us defeat Apophis. And protect us from other,
     evil Goa'ulds.

     CARTER

     (Skeptical)
     And you bought into all of this.

     DANIEL
     General, I'd like permission to have Hathor come down here and
     debrief us.

     O'NEILL

     Whoa, Danny!
     (scoffing)
     I don't think so.

     DANIEL

     General.
     (Moves to stand directly in front of Hammond)
     I think you sense what I do. Hathor is a friend.

   [DANIEL stares at HAMMOND, who meets his eyes. DANIEL'S eyes glow pink
   for a moment, and HAMMOND'S eyes widen. He nods.]

     HAMMOND
     Yes, I do believe that. Bring her down.

     CARTER
     Are you kidding?

     O'NEILL
     Whoa, General.

     HAMMOND

     (Sternly)
     Colonel!

     O'NEILL
     Sir, are you sure?

     HAMMOND
     Yes, Colonel.

   [CARTER and O'NEILL stare at him in disbelief. TEAL'C moves across the
   room.]

     TEAL'C
     General. I have served the Goa'uld. I have yet to meet a good one.

     HAMMOND
     Maybe that's because you served the wrong one.

     CARTER
     Sir, at least close the blast door so she can't see the Gate.

   [HAMMOND nods, and an airman hits the button. The blast door closes.
   HATHOR enters the room from the same staircase DANIEL came down.]

     HATHOR
     We thank you for allowing us in your court.

     HAMMOND

     (smiling benevolently)
     You're welcome.

     HATHOR
     We would appreciate a drink from your water.

     HAMMOND
     Colonel?

     O'NEILL

     General? HAMMOND
     Colonel, water for the lady.
     (smiles at Hathor, looking besotted)

     O'NEILL
     Ah! Yes, of course.

   [With an unhappy expression, O'NEILL pours water and carries it to
   HATHOR.]

     HATHOR
     You are the one who is responsible for destroying the vile one, Ra.

     O'NEILL
     I would be the one.

     HATHOR
     For you, we will forever hold a special place, here.

   [HATHOR takes O'NEILL'S hand and raises it, placing it over her heart.]

     O'NEILL
     Well that's very special. Thank you.

   [O'NEILL tries to pull his hand back, but HATHOR grabs it, lifting it
   to her mouth. She breathes pink mist on him. O'NEILL appears confused,
   looks around the room at his team, then goes to sit down at the table.
   CARTER and TEAL'C look on suspiciously as HATHOR smirks.]

     TEAL'C

     (Crossing the room to loom over HATHOR)
     She is a Goa'uld.

     HATHOR

     (To Teal'c)
     Jaffa. In service to Apophis, the serpent, vile creature that he is.

     TEAL'C
     I am no longer in the service of Apophis.

     HATHOR
     We despise all that Ra, Apophis and their kind do and believe.

     DANIEL
     It's all right. So does Teal'c.

     HATHOR
     Then your enemy, is our enemy. Together, we can defeat them.

     TEAL'C
     I will serve no Goa'uld.

   [HATHOR takes TEAL'C'S hand and raises it to her mouth. She breathes
   pink mist on him, but he just glares at her, impervious.]

     DANIEL
     What do you say, General?

     HAMMOND

     (smiling affably)
     I say we should make the lady comfortable, and welcome her.

     CARTER

     (Outraged)
     General, sir. I have a problem with this.

     DANIEL
     Hathor, this is Captain Carter.

   [CARTER crosses to stand before HATHOR.]

     HATHOR
     You are an exceedingly beautiful woman.

     CARTER

     Thank you. So are you.
     (Suspiciously, speaking to the General, but not taking her eyes off
     Hathor)
     General Hammond, I believe we should keep Miss Hathor under house
     arrest until we can better assess...

     HAMMOND

     (Reprimanding)
     Don't be impolite, Captain.

     CARTER

     (Incredulous)
     Impolite, Sir? She's a Goa'uld.

     HAMMOND
     She's a guest at this facility, Captain.

     CARTER
     Sir, this is crazy, it doesn't make any sense. Colonel O'Neill?

     HAMMOND

     (angrily)
     I am in command of this facility, Captain Carter, not Colonel
     O'Neill. Is that understood?

     CARTER
     But Sir...

     HAMMOND
     Understood?

     CARTER
     Well sir, with respect, it seems that this woman has all you guys
     under some sort of spell or something.

     HAMMOND
     Are you questioning my orders, Captain?

     CARTER

     Yes sir, I guess I am.
     (Turns to O'Neill)
     Colonel O'Neill, are you going to back me up on this?

     O'NEILL

     Yes, Captain.
     (Takes a sip of water as Carter looks relieved)
     If I see that there's a problem.

   [Carter's mouth drops open with surprise.]

     HAMMOND

     Thank you, Colonel.
     (Smiling again at Hathor)
     Now, if you'll follow me, I would be honored to give you a tour of
     our facility.

   [HATHOR returns the smile, but she stares at Carter, her gaze stony.
   When HAMMOND and HATHOR leave; DANIEL follows.]

   INT--SGC GUEST QUARTERS

   [DANIEL opens the door and leads HATHOR into the room. It's much nicer
   than the holding cell she was in before.]

     DANIEL
     This is the guest quarters.

     HAMMOND and O'NEILL follow them into the room.

     HATHOR
     This will do fine.

     HAMMOND
     We'll post a couple guards outside.

     HATHOR
     Guards? To protect us or...to protect everyone else?

   [HATHOR stands close to HAMMOND and breathes out more pink mist. He
   breathes it in, and stares at her.]

     HAMMOND

     (over his shoulder, his eyes not leaving Hathor)
     Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     Sir.

     HAMMOND
     Let's forget the guards.

     O'NEILL

     (doubtfully)
     Are you sure, General?

     HATHOR

     You can trust us, Colonel.
     (She moves to stand in front of O'NEILL)

     O'NEILL

     Oh, that's not in question, Ma'am. But it is our policy to
     secure...all quarters...for...(Hathor leans in and breathes the pink
     mist on him. His words stumble to a halt and he shakes his head with
     confusion)
     The Guards probably aren't necessary.

     HATHOR
     Our thanks to you.

     O'NEILL
     Uh...(clears throat)...I suppose we should let you get some...rest.

     HAMMOND
     Yes.

   [HAMMOND and O'NEILL leave the room. DANIEL moves to follow.]

     HATHOR
     Dr Jackson? Please remain. We have other questions.

     DANIEL

     (closes the door)
     Sure.

     HATHOR
     It is time that you become our chosen one.

     DANIEL

     (Walks across the room to stand before her)
     Chosen one?

     HATHOR

     (Intently)
     Will you always honor us?

     DANIEL
     Yes.

     HATHOR
     Would you...die for us?

     DANIEL

     Die?
     (He blinks. Hathor smiles)
     Yes.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 25

   [CARTER leaves the stairway, walking into O'NEILL. She follows him down
   the corridor.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, there you are.

     O'NEILL
     Here I am, Captain.

     CARTER
     I wanted to have a word with you, sir, about Hathor, if you don't
     mind.

     O'NEILL
     Fascinating lady, isn't she?

     CARTER
     A little too fascinating, don't you think?

     O'NEILL
     What do you mean?

     CARTER
     Well, sir. She seems to have you all so...infatuated.

     O'NEILL
     Us all?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. The men. Don't you think it's a little dangerous to be
     giving a Goa'uld such royal treatment?

     O'NEILL
     Ah, relax Captain. She's on our side.

     CARTER
     So she says.

   [O'NEILL looks at CARTER disapprovingly.]

     O'NEILL
     Captain, if you don't mind my saying so, you're treating her exactly
     the way you hate to see people treat Teal'c. A bit of a double
     standard, don't you think?

     CARTER
     Teal'c has proven who's side he's on. She hasn't.

     O'NEILL
     Carter, have you ever heard the old saying: 'My enemy's enemy is my
     friend'?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. But even when the CIA grants sanctuary to an enemy
     turncoat, they never trust him. They watch him like a hawk.

     O'NEILL

     Daniel's watching her right now.
     (He pats Carter on the shoulder)
     Relax.

   [As O'NEILL walks away, CARTER stares at the spot where he had touched
   her.]

   INT--SGC--GATE ROOM

   [The sarcophagus is in the middle of the room. HATHOR and DANIEL
   enter.]

     HATHOR
     Tell us, our beloved, what are the questions swelling in your mind?

   [HATHOR runs one hand along the sarcophagus, moving toward the Gate.]

     DANIEL
     I spent years studying you as a student, and now I'm...I'm with you.
     Do you know that you're described in history as the most beautiful
     woman ever was or ever will be, able to control men with just your
     beauty?

     HATHOR

     (Looks up at the Gate possessively)
     We are pleased to see you, old friend. It won't be long until you
     will serve us once again.
     (to Daniel)
     Tell us, do you believe this to be true, now that you have come to
     know us?

     DANIEL
     Well, I certainly have a deeper understanding of it now.

     HATHOR
     We are the queen of the gods. We are the mother of all gods.

     DANIEL

     Yes.
     (He looks confused)
     What does that mean, exactly?

     HATHOR
     From us, all others come.

     DANIEL
     I don't understand.

     HATHOR
     The Jaffa. He has a Goa'uld child in his belly?

     DANIEL
     A larva. Yes.

     HATHOR
     Did you ever wonder from whence the children come?

     DANIEL
     Are you saying that they come from you?

     HATHOR
     Yes. And others, like us.

     DANIEL
     My god. You're like a queen bee. You create the Goa'ulds.

   [DANIEL looks shocked. HATHOR smiles.]

   INT SGC--INFIRMARY

   [CARTER is typing on a computer in one of the offices. DR FRAISER, who
   is walking down the corridor, sees her and stops, then enters the
   room.]

     DR FRAISER
     Captain Carter? What are you doing?

     CARTER
     Have you noticed the way the men on the base are acting?

     DR FRAISER

     Yes. Thank you.
     (sounding annoyed)
     You noticed too?

     CARTER
     It all seems to be tied into the arrival of this Hathor person...or,
     whatever she is. I'm researching her right now on the Net.

     DR FRAISER
     What have you found?

     CARTER
     This is really Daniel's field, so I'm kinda starting from scratch.
     This one academic webpage theorizes that a bunch of the sex
     goddesses from different cultures were actually all the same woman.
     Hathor. The Greeks identified her with Aphrodite, there's Ishtar of
     Babylon, Astarte of Syria, Ceres of Rome...

     DR FRAISER
     Sounds like she got around.

     CARTER
     Yeah, in most of the mythology. And she's pretty loved in all of it.
     Except for a late period in Ancient Egypt where, according to one of
     the stories, she was sent by Ra to destroy mankind. And then he
     changed his mind, and they became enemies.

     DR FRAISER
     So, then when she says she's Ra's enemy, she may not be lying.

     CARTER

     Yeah. But here's the interesting thing.
     (Intently)
     According to the stories, this woman had magical powers over men.
     She was supposed to be able to seduce them into doing anything for
     her. In almost every case, it describes them as 'drunk with her
     presence'.

     DR FRAISER
     Well, that would be how I'd describe our boys.

     CARTER
     Yeah, Now, I figure she's using some form of Goa'uld technology. Any
     ideas?

     DR FRAISER
     My guess would be some sort of chemical we've never seen. A...a sort
     of super pheromones combined with something like sodium pentathol,
     probably airborne delivery.

     CARTER
     Great. How do we reverse it in the men?

     DR FRAISER
     Oh, it may not be reversible. And if it is, it may take years.

     CARTER

     (worried)
     We probably don't even have days before this Goa'uld does whatever
     it is she's trying to do.

     DR FRAISER
     So what do you suggest, Captain?

     CARTER

     (firmly)
     I suggest we neutralize her.

   INT -- SGC GUEST QUARTERS

   [DANIEL leads HATHOR into the room.]

     DANIEL
     So you actually create the larvae. How?

     HATHOR
     We must first have the code of life from the juices of the species
     intended as the host.

     DANIEL
     Code of life?

     HATHOR
     In order to ensure compatibility for the Goa'uld child and the host.

     DANIEL
     DNA. You mean you need DNA to prevent rejection.

     HATHOR

     The code of life.
     (smirking)
     We do so enjoy the method of procuring the code in your species.
     (She removes Daniel's glasses, and runs her hands through his hair)
     It is much more pleasurable than most.

     DANIEL
     I bet.

     HATHOR

     Since you are to be our first pharaoh,
     (she pushes Daniel's jacket from his shoulders and off his arms)
     you will honor us by being the one to contribute the code.

   [HATHOR places one hand on the back of DANIEL'S neck.]

     DANIEL
     You want me to help you create more Goa'ulds?

   [HATHOR leans in to kiss DANIEL, but he reaches up and puts his hand on
   her arm, trying to push her away. They are at an impass for seconds,
   then HATHOR breathes pink mist out, and DANIEL inhales it. His hand
   drops, and he stands stock-still, looking mesmerized.]

     HATHOR
     Now that Ra is gone, we are finally free to rule this planet. With
     you, our beloved, at our side. For all eternity.

   [HATHOR places her hands on DANIEL'S face and pulls him into a kiss.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [CARTER pulls several weapons out of a storage locker in the corner,
   handing them out to the women standing around. There's one Gate
   technician, three soldiers and Dr Fraiser.]

     CARTER

     Okay, here's what we know. This creature, who calls herself Hathor,
     is admittedly a Goa'uld, or some form of Goa'uld. So she has who
     knows what kinds of weapons or defenses. That means it might take a
     lot of firepower to neutralize her and we need to come at her from
     multiple flanks.
     (Hands Fraiser a gun)
     You know how to use this, don't you?

     DR FRAISER

     (Doubtfully)
     Well, yeah. I've had some training, but I haven't touched one of
     these in years.

     CARTER
     Well, don't worry. All you do is point and pull the trigger and be
     careful not to hurt any of our own men. They're all pretty loopy
     right now, so that shouldn't be a problem.

   [TEAL'C enters the room.]

     TEAL'C

     Captain Carter.
     (The women whirl around, aiming their weapons at him)
     We must speak of Hathor.

     CARTER
     Keep your hands where I can see them Teal'c.

     TEAL'C

     (Holding his hands out to his sides)
     Do you not trust me, Captain Carter?

     CARTER
     All of the men on this base are under Hathor's control, from what I
     can tell. And, I hate to break it to you Teal'c, but you are male.

     TEAL'C
     I am a Jaffa. The Goa'uld I carry within me protects me from
     Hathor's powers. It is only together that we may stop her.

     CARTER
     From doing what, exactly?

     TEAL'C
     It is legend among the Jaffa that the original Goa'uld larvae come
     from the queen Goa'ulds.

     CARTER
     And you think Hathor's one of them?

     TEAL'C
     Yes. If I am correct, this base will become her nest. From here, she
     will populate your world with new Goa'uld. I cannot permit this to
     happen. Captain Carter, we cannot permit this to happen.

   [CARTER nods and takes off the gun she has slung over her shoulder,
   handing it to TEAL'C.]

     CARTER
     Glad you're with us, Teal'c.

   INT--SGC CORRIDORS

   [CARTER leads the way through the corridors, DR FRAISER and TEAL'C
   behind her.]

     DR FRAISER
     Is this really necessary? I mean, somebody's bound to come on base
     and see what's going on.

     CARTER

     (Sounding disgusted)
     Yeah, and if they're male, they'll be under Hathor's control before
     they can think about it. Besides, when was the last time you saw a
     new woman get assigned here?

   [CARTER kicks open the door to the Guest Quarters and enters. She scans
   the room, but there is no sign of HATHOR. The room is in disarray; a
   lamp tipped over and the bedcovers thrown on the floor. DANIEL is
   sitting on the edge of the bed, staring into space.]

     CARTER

     (Cautiously)
     Daniel? You okay? Where is she, Daniel?

   [DANIEL does not respond. One of the female airmen enters.]

     FEMALE AIRMAN
     Captain, we found her. She was spotted going into the locker room.

     CARTER

     All right, let's go.
     (She leans down to look at Daniel's face with concern)
     Daniel, you okay?

     FEMALE AIRMAN

     (Urgently)
     Captain?

   [They leave. Behind them, DANIEL continues to star into space blankly.
   TEAL'C looks in with a frown before following the women.]

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [CARTER and DR FRAISER enter cautiously, their guns ready. Behind them,
   the other female soldiers scan the corridors. CARTER gives the women
   hand signals, directing them to surround their target.]

   [Inside the locker room, HATHOR reclines in a steaming hot tub. The
   water bubbles around her. She is, apparently, alone. CARTER approaches
   cautiously. HATHOR'S eyes fly open.]

     HATHOR
     Ring'tel nok.

   [HAMMOND, O'NEILL and several other SGC male personnel enter the room,
   surrounding the hot tub. Some are carrying weapons, which they aim at
   the female soldiers.]

     HAMMOND
     Stand down, Captain Carter. Unless you plan to kill us.

   [CARTER looks shocked.]

     O'NEILL
     Is this any way to treat a guest, Captain?

   [Male soldiers surround the group of female soldiers and TEAL'C. Guns
   click, and CARTER'S band drop their weapons. HATHOR smiles.]

   INT SGC HOLDING CELL

   [CARTER stands at the door. DR FRAISER paces. Two female airmen are
   seated at the table, talking; one sits on a bed.]

     CARTER
     It must be a pretty powerful drug Hathor's using. Colonel O'Neill is
     Special Forces trained to fight mind control techniques.

     DR FRAISER
     Well, not Goa'uld techniques, apparently.

     CARTER

     Yup.
     (She leans her head back against the wall)
     Well, Mama said there'd be days like this.

     DR FRAISER

     Really? My ex-husband said that.
     (Imitates a southern accent)
     'You outa your mind, honey-buns? There is a reason they call it this
     man's Army'.
     (Rolls her eyes and grins.)

     CARTER

     (Laughs)
     'This man's Army'? Your husband actually said that?

     DR FRAISER
     Yeah, so of course I explained to him that it wasn't the Army, it
     was the Air Force, and they've had women for decades.

     CARTER

     (Shakes her head, looking rueful)
     Man. I think maybe it's just me, but I can't figure out how feel
     like one of the guys with these guys, you know what I mean? I always
     feel like I'm The Girl.

     DR FRAISER

     (looks excited)
     That's it.

     CARTER
     What?

     DR FRAISER
     You just gave me an idea on how to get us out of here. Look, if
     Hathor's control drug is hormone-driven like I suspect, that means
     she's making the men...libidinous.

     CARTER

     (Doubtfully)
     Okay. Why do I get the feeling I don't like where this is going?

   INT --SGC GUEST QUARTERS

   [HATHOR is standing in the room. O'NEILL enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Excuse me, Ma'am. I'm,uh...I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
     but I'd like to ask you some questions.

     HATHOR
     About?

     O'NEILL
     About you, actually. See, you've...You've got me a little
     off-balance, and that's very unnatural for me.

     HATHOR
     We are told by the one that you call Daniel that you are responsible
     for ridding us from the vile one, Ra.

     O'NEILL

     (nods)
     Yeah, well we kinda touched on that earlier. But I'd like to be the
     one asking the questions right now, if you don't mind.

     HATHOR

     (Gazes up at him)
     We must praise you and gift you a great honor.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. I'm sure that'd be just great, but not right...

   [HATHOR breathes out more of the pink mist, which O'NEILL inhales. His
   face loses all animation as he stares at her, standing stock still.
   HATHOR unbuttons his shirt, pushing it open to reveal his bare
   stomach.]

   [HATHOR yanks off her dress to reveal a intricate contraption wrapped
   around her middle. In the center is a glowing red object. HATHOR
   presses herself against O'NEILL, and the red glow intensifies. She
   wraps her arms around him, and he stands in her grasp. HATHOR'S
   expression is blissful, while O'NEILL's face is hidden in her
   shoulder.]

     HATHOR
     Do not worry yourself. You will enjoy the richness that come with
     what we are giving you.

   [O'NEILL flinches in pain.]

     HATHOR
     You will cherish the good health and long life that goes with
     being...

   [HATHOR pushes O'NEILL away from her, and he hits the wall. He is
   sweating, his face contorted in pain.]

     HATHOR

     (Goa'uld voice)
     Hathor's first, new, Jaffa.

   [HATHOR smiles, and O'NEILL looks down to his stomach. He reaches down
   with trembling hands to touch the X cut into it--a Jaffa pouch.]

   INT--SGC HOLDING CELL

   [CARTER and DR FRAISER stand in front of the door.]

     CARTER

     (Grimacing)
     You know, using seduction wasn't in any of the AF Training manuals I
     ever read.

     DR FRAISER
     What? You think the Pentagon anticipated a 4,000 year old alien
     walking onto a base and drugging all the men to make them...

     CARTER
     Libidinous?

     DR FRAISER
     Yeah.

     CARTER
     I suppose the do train us to take advantage of the enemy's weakness.

     DR FRAISER
     Exactly.

   [Both women smile.]

     CARTER

     (sighs)
     All right, let's do it.

   [DR FRAISER knocks on the door.]

     DR FRAISER

     (Shouting)
     Airman, open up! We've got something for you.

     AIRMAN
     What?

     DR FRAISER

     (Coyly)
     Why don't you come in here and see for yourself?

     AIRMAN
     No can do. We only take orders from Hathor.

     DR FRAISER

     Gentlemen, there are five women in here,
     (suggestively)
     very alone.

     Carter

     (Rolling her eyes)
     Why do I feel like I'm in a women behind bars movie?

   [DR FRAISER crosses to the bunks. She and one of the female airmen take
   off their jackets and look sultry.]

     AIRMAN
     What are you suggesting, ladies?

     DR FRAISER

     (Smirking)
     Whatever you want, Airman.

   [The soldier leers and motions to his companion and enters the room.
   The first soldier bends over to kiss DR FRAISER, while the second one
   grins at the female airman. CARTER grabs his face as he enters the
   room, smiling at him. He leers back, and she decks him with her elbow.
   The female soldier he was smiling at grabs the airman bent over DR
   FRAISER while FRAISER grabs his gun. CARTER gets the other man's gun.]

     CARTER
     Feel like a woman, Doc?

     DR FRAISER

     (wiping her face)
     Oh, yeah.

     CARTER
     Let's tie them up.

   INT--SGC CORRIDORS

   [Two of CARTER's band walk down the corridor. An airman stops them,
   cocking his gun.]

     AIRMAN
     Hold it right there, ladies.

   [One of the female solders hits him on the head with her rifle. Just as
   she's smiling at her compatriots in relief, HAMMOND moves in behind
   her, aiming a pistol.]

     HAMMOND
     Drop your weapon!

   [CARTER hits HAMMOND with the but of her rifle. He drops to the floor,
   unconscious.]

     CARTER

     (Shakes her head)
     Yeah, my career is over.

     DR FRAISER
     Don't worry about it. I can fix him up as good as new when this
     thing's over.

     CARTER
     Great. So he can bring me up on charges.

   [DR FRAISER checks HAMMOND while CARTER lets TEAL'C out of his cell.]

     TEAL'C
     I am pleased to see you, Captain Carter.

     CARTER

     I'm glad someone is.
     (To female airman)
     Lock these guys up and stay here.
     (hands Teal'c a gun)
     Okay?

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [CARTER moves around wall, aiming her rifle.]

     CARTER
     Okay, let Teal'c and me take the lead.

     DR FRAISER
     No argument there.

     CARTER

     On three.
     (She starts to count, but Teal'c simply moves past her.)

   [With TEAL'C in the lead, they move into the locker room. This time,
   the hot tub is full of squealing Goa'uld larvae moving beneath the
   surface. There is a light coming from the bottom of the tub. O'NEILL is
   laying on the ground at the base, uncomfortably draped across the
   steps.]

   [CARTER approaches cautiously, reaching out to check on O'NEILL. He
   doesn't move as she touches his hand. As CARTER aims her rifle in the
   hot tub, there is a sound. She moves to hide with DR FRAISER and TEAL'C
   behind a half-wall as HATHOR rises from the tub. HATHOR gets out of the
   water, totally dry, and goes to O'NEILL. She rolls him over, and lifts
   him to his feet.]

     HATHOR
     Do not worry, child. You will soon receive your Goa'uld. And then,
     you will begin to feel strong again.

   [HATHOR moves O'NEILL like a puppet, and he seems not to notice. She
   helps him into the tub full of larvae. CARTER and DR FRAISER exchange a
   horrified glance.]

     HATHOR
     The strongest of the larvae will soon find your womb and move into
     it.

   [She lifts several larvae out of the water and holds them in front of
   O'Neill. He stares at them, his expression empty.]

     HATHOR

     At that moment, you will begin your service to us.
     (Goa'uld voice)
     Enjoy.

   [HATHOR walks out of the room.]

     CARTER

     (Determined)
     Let's get him out of there.

   [CARTER, DR FRAISER and TEAL'C move forward. TEAL'C hands CARTER his
   weapon and lifts O'NEILL out of the tub.]

     CARTER

     (moves under O'Neill's arm to take some of his weight)
     Okay Colonel, we gotcha. Okay.

   [They carry O'NEILL to a bench.]

     DR FRAISER

     (Handing guns to Carter)
     Here, take this.
     (She reaches her hand into the new Jaffa pouch and feels around)
     Yeaguh....No. Nothing went in there yet.

     CARTER
     This is a good thing.

     DR FRAISER

     (Doubtfully)
     Uh, maybe.

     TEAL'C
     He no longer has an immune system. Without a Goa'uld larvae, he will
     soon die.

   [O'NEILL'S eyes are open, but he doesn't seem to register their
   presence.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR TO GATE ROOM

   [CARTER and DR FRAISER move down the corridor. TEAL'C follows them,
   with O'NEILL draped across his shoulders.]

     DR FRAISER
     Shouldn't we be taking him to the infirmary?

     TEAL'C
     You said you do not have the technology to help him.

     DR FRAISER
     Well, we could at least make him comfortable.

     TEAL'C
     The Goa'ulds have the technology, and Hathor may have brought it to
     us.

     CARTER
     The sarcophagus.

   [CARTER runs a card through the access panel, and the door to the Gate
   room slides open. With the door closed, CARTER and TEAL'C place O'NEILL
   in the sarcophagus. TEAL'C moves to the control panel.]

     TEAL'C
     I have seen the Goa'uld chamber do many miracles.

   [He turns a lever, closing O'NEILL inside the sarcophagus. CARTER and
   DR FRAISER look on, worried. Suddenly, the door opens and two airmen
   enter, firing guns. CARTER, DR FRAISER and TEAL'C move for cover,
   firing back. DR FRAISER is hit high in the shoulder, TEAL'C in the
   thigh and arm. CARTER crawls behind sarcophagus as HATHOR enters the
   room. The sarcophagus begins to open.]

     HATHOR

     (shouting)
     Stop! You will harm our new Jaffa.

   [The airmen stop firing as O'NEILL sits up.]

     O'NEILL
     Argh. What's going on?

   [HATHOR raises the hand with the ribbon device. O'NEILL jumps out of
   the sarcophagus as a beam of energy hits it. He lands beside CARTER.
   The beam hits the sarcophagus.]

     CARTER

     Colonel!
     (She hands him a weapon.)

   [Blue lightning is playing over the surface of the sarcophagus. An
   ominous whining starts, increasing in pitch and volume quickly. HATHOR
   swirls around and stalks out of the room, the airmen behind her.]

     O'NEILL

     I don't think this is good.
     (Motions for the others to leave through another door.)

   [As the door is closing, the sarcophagus explodes, throwing O'NEILL,
   CARTER, DR FRAISER and TEAL'C to the ground.]

     O'NEILL
     You all right?

     CARTER
     Yeah, good to have you back, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     What, I left?

   [DR FRAISER struggles to her feet, holding her arm. She and TEAL'C
   stand in the doorway while CARTER and O'NEILL go back into the Gate
   room. It's a smoking mess. Bits of sarcophagus litter the room, still
   burning.]

     O'NEILL
     Wow.

     CARTER
     Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah?

     CARTER

     (Looking down toward his stomach)
     Do you mind if I have a look?

     O'NEILL

     (Affronted)
     At what?

     CARTER

     You were uh...um...(looks down again)
     Let's just say you were wounded.

   [O'NEILL holds his jacket open, revealing a normal, human stomach.]

     CARTER
     Wow. That's a miracle.

     O'NEILL

     (Looking down and frowning)
     Crunches.

     DR FRAISER
     Too bad she blew up that sarcophagus. We could use one of those
     things in the infirmary right about now.

     O'NEILL
     Get yourselves down there right away.

     CARTER

     (to O'Neill)
     Now what?

     O'NEILL
     Now, you and I go for that Goa'uld.

     CARTER
     Well, how? She's guarded by our own men. We can't exactly go in
     shooting.

     O'NEILL
     We can with tranquilizer guns.

     CARTER
     I thought of that, sir. But there weren't any in the armory.

     O'NEILL

     (looks back at Carter)
     This is the military, Captain. We always have more than we need.
     There's a supply in lockup C.

     CARTER
     It'd be nice if someone told me that.

     O'NEILL
     Your tax dollar at work.

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [HATHOR is back in the hot tub, which is now swarming with larvae.
   DANIEL is at her side, gazing up at her with a combination of concern
   and adoration. Four large airmen are standing around them, on guard.]

     HATHOR

     (in a Goa'uld voice)
     We demand that the woman you call Carter be brought before us so
     that we might gain retribution.

     DANIEL
     Captain Carter does deserve to be punished, my queen, but she does
     not know what she is doing. I beg of you to show mercy.

   [O'NEILL and CARTER sneak into the room, armed with tranquilizer guns.]

     HATHOR

     (in Goa'uld voice)
     She deserves no mercy from us. She will make amends with her death.

   [O'NEILL nods at CARTER. They both rise and fire, hitting all four
   airmen, who collapse to the floor.]

     CARTER
     I don't think so.

   [HATHOR raises the ribbon device. A blue beam shoots out, throwing
   CARTER across the room to hit the wall. She falls to the floor. HATHOR
   looks at O'NEILL.]

     HATHOR

     (in Goa'uld voice, furious)
     You have failed us, our love. You will not fail us, again.

   [HATHOR'S eyes glow as she stares at O'NEILL. He stands there, frozen,
   staring back. HATHOR raises the ribbon device again. It glows red.
   CARTER appears and fires her pistol at HATHOR, hitting her several
   times. HATHOR falls under the water. The water boils, and the tub
   bursts into flames.]

     DANIEL

     (Shouting desperately)
     Nooooo!

   [Burning larvae fall out of the tub and to the floor. CARTER and
   O'NEILL rush to pick up the first two fallen airmen.]

     O'NEILL
     Get these airmen out of here. Daniel, move it. Let's go!

   [DANIEL stands frozen, staring at the burning tub. As CARTER and
   O'NEILL drag the third and fourth airmen out of the room, a shape,
   disguised by the flames, climbs out of the tub and walks to the
   doorway. It's HATHOR. No one sees her. O'NEILL and CARTER come back,
   each taking one of DANIEL'S arms.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, Danny.

   [As they rush him from the room, two of the female soldiers come in
   with fire extinguishers and start to spray the burning tub.]

     AUTOMATED VOICE
     Unauthorized Gate activation. All hands to the Gate room.
     Unauthorized Gate activation.

   [O'NEILL and CARTER rush into the Observation room. CARTER hits the
   control for the blast door. It rises, to reveal HATHOR, looking none
   the worse for wear, standing in front of a wormhole. HATHOR turns and
   stares at them for a moment, before stepping through Stargate.]

     O'NEILL
     Where did she go?

     CARTER
     Chulak. We have to go after her.

   [The wormhole shuts down.]

     O'NEILL
     We will. Not right now.

     DANIEL

     (looking confused)
     Hey. What's going on? I must have...blacked out.

     CARTER

     I guess she needs to stay in proximity to keep control. O'NEILL
     (Blankly)
     Control what?

   [CARTER frowns, and looks back at DANIEL.]

     DANIEL
     What? What are you talking about?

   INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM

   [Later. DR FRAISER, her arm in a sling, is bending over to the floor,
   taking samples of the gooey substance that dripped from the hot tub.
   CARTER is assisting her. O'NEILL DANIEL, and TEAL'C, in civilian
   clothing, enter the room.]

     O'NEILL
     Did you find anything?

     DR FRAISER
     Probably nothing we can use. Maybe we'll at least get a cellular
     level analysis on the Goa'ulds, maybe we even find some DNA
     information.

     DANIEL

     (Uncomfortably)
     A lot of that will probably be mine.

     O'NEILL
     Ew.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [HAMMOND enters. CARTER and DR FRAISER jump to their feet.]

     CARTER

     (Nervously)
     General Hammond, sir.

     HAMMOND
     At ease, Captain. At ease, Doctor.

     CARTER
     Thank you sir. About your head, I'd like to explain that if I could.

     HAMMOND
     Captain, I'm putting you and Dr Fraiser up for a commendation medal.

     CARTER

     Well, thank you sir, but I can explain...(She stops in confusion,
     looking over at Fraiser)
     You are?

     HAMMOND
     If you hadn't kept your wits about you and done whatever was
     necessary, we could have put this entire planet at risk. Good job,
     ladies.

   [DR FRAISER smiles. CARTER looks relieved.]

     CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

     HAMMOND

     (with a smile)
     Well, that's all.

   [CARTER tries not to look too pleased, but she can't hide her smile.]

     O'NEILL

     (grinning)
     Nice job.

     DANIEL
     Yeah.

   [CARTER ducks her head and smiles.]
