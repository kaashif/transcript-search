   PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1

   [Scenes from Avalon Parts One and Two are shown.]

   EXT--PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY

   [The ground is a flat stone surface, covered with a few inches of
   water. A ring platform activates, with rings rising through the small
   amount of water. Prior One, Vala and Daniel appear.]

     DANIEL
     Where are we?

     PRIOR ONE
     The Plains of Celestis.

     VALA
     And that?

   [Vala points. In the distance is a large golden city reflecting the
   daylight. It has large towers, domed roofs, various spires, and other
   ornate structuring.]

     PRIOR ONE
     City of the Gods.

   [Daniel and Vala exchange looks. The Prior starts walking towards the
   city. Daniel and Vala follow.]

     DANIEL
     Maybe you could tell me who you are.

     PRIOR ONE
     I am a Prior of the Ori.

     DANIEL
     And what is that?

     PRIOR ONE
     In time, all in due time.

   INT--CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [Prior One leads them down a large corridor. Its floors and walls are
   marble, and tall ornate windows overlook the city. Vala and Daniel look
   around as they walk. A set of double doors opens at the end of the
   hall, and the Prior leads them into a windowed room decorated with
   large pictures similar to medieval tapestries. It is furnished with a
   large dining table and chairs. Candles on pillars are at either side of
   the doorway. On the dining table is a silver bowl of fruit and a large
   book. Once Vala and Daniel fully enter the room, the Prior turns and
   leaves, the doors shutting behind him. Vala and Daniel turn and
   approach the closing doors as they realize they're being locked in.]

     DANIEL

     (voice rising)
     Uh, I guess we'll just wait here? Is that what we're going to do?

   [Vala sighs.]

   EXT--P3X-421, DAY

   [In a desert, a tented settlement sets near the Stargate. People,
   dressed in desert robes, are going about their daily activities when
   the Stargate activates. The villagers approach the Stargate. A lone
   figure steps through. It is another Prior. He too is wearing a hooded
   robe and carries a blue orbed staff. He also carries a book similar to
   what was on the dining table in the room where Daniel and Vala now are.
   Prior Two lowers his hood. His head is bald. Like Prior One, his skin
   is pale and his eyes are milky-colored and slightly off-focus. He looks
   at the villagers.]

     PRIOR TWO
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell, Lam, and Teal'c are all seated at the table. Landry is
   pacing by the end of the table nearest his office.]

     LAM
     Both Daniel and Vala's vitals have been stable for two hours now.

     LANDRY
     What about disconnecting them from the device?

     LAM
     Dr. Lee has been unable to remove the stones.

     MITCHELL
     We haven't tried C-4 yet, sir.

     LAM

     (sternly)
     Dr. Lee is working on disabling the power source. But given that the
     device is tied directly into their minds, I recommend we proceed
     with caution.

     LANDRY

     (voice rising as he speaks)
     I understand. But if one or both of them run into trouble again, I'm
     ordering you to take whatever action is necessary to shut that thing
     down!

   [Lam glares but stays silent.]

     LANDRY
     Teal'c, a word.

   [Landry enters his office. Teal'c follows.]

   INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE

     LANDRY
     What can you tell me about this Gerak fellow?

     TEAL'C
     He was First Prime of Montu, a minor Goa'uld who served Ra, then
     later fell in with Ba'al when Ra was killed. After the fall of the
     Goa'uld, Ba'al's armada was led by a Jaffa named Hubrok. Hubrok was
     an ally of Bra'tac's and would have supported our desire to reform
     the Jaffa nation with democracy. However, approximately four months
     ago, Hubrok disappeared.

     LANDRY
     You think Gerak had something to do with it?

     TEAL'C

     (nodding assent)
     Mmm, though no evidence has been uncovered. But shortly after
     Hubrok's disappearance, Gerak emerged as spokesperson for the more
     traditional ways of the Jaffa High Council.

   [Landry sits in his chair.]

     LANDRY
     Which he could control.

     TEAL'C
     Through a series of slow and deliberate manipulations, the Council
     played squarely into Gerak's hands.

     LANDRY
     Well, that makes him one of the most powerful guys out there...at
     least that we know of. I suppose I should meet him face to face.

     TEAL'C

     (bowing)
     I will extend your invitation.

   [Teal'c exits the office.]

   EXT--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY

   INT--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [Daniel is sitting at the end of the table, reading the book. Vala is
   lying on her back on top of the table.]

     VALA
     All right, Daniel, what does it say?

     DANIEL
     Well, it seems to follow suit with many of the religions I've
     studied. They tend to weave their doctrines into simple fable-like
     narratives with characters that are meant to be identifiable to a
     common individual.

   [Vala turns and sits up, groaning and stretching lazily.]

     VALA
     Well, why don't you read one to me? I love a good yarn.

   [Daniel glances at her and turns a page of the book.]

     DANIEL
     Well, they all seem to teach meditation on one's worth and
     significance, the path of righteousness towards a state of higher
     being.

   [Vala takes a bite of an apple from the fruit bowl, then offers the
   apple to Daniel. Daniel looks at her with slight alarm.]

     VALA

     (oblivious to the reference)
     What? I'm starving.

   [Daniel takes a deep breath, but does not explain. Vala continues to
   eat the apple.]

     DANIEL
     The central icon of the religion seems to be fire.

     VALA
     I don't need a book to tell me that.

     DANIEL

     (thinking out loud)
     That would make sense. Fire is light, energy, warmth...and yet, on
     Earth, at some point, fire became associated with demonic imagery.
     Things that are evil. Hell, not heaven.

     VALA

     (still eating)
     And?

     DANIEL
     I was just wondering if the Ancients had something to do with that.

   [Vala stretches out across the table again, this time on her stomach,
   propped up by her elbows She reaches towards the tome.]

     VALA
     Tell you what, why don't you flip to the end, and see how it all
     turns out, hmm?

   [While speaking, Vala turns a large section of pages at once so that
   the last page of the book is showing. She pats it a few times and looks
   at Daniel. Daniel glares at her in irritation. They both hear a thud
   and turn to the door. The door opens on its own and Prior One enters.
   Vala jumps to her feet and hides the half eaten apple back in the fruit
   bowl. She attempts to disguise that she still has a piece of apple in
   her mouth.]

     PRIOR ONE
     The village of Ver Ager has been corrupted.

     VALA

     (mouth full of apple)
     We didn't do it. I promise.

     DANIEL
     We are connected to these people, Harrid and Sallis, by means of a
     communication device that was brought to our galaxy a long time ago
     by a race of people called the Alterans.

     VALA

     (swallowing the last of her apple)
     Also known as the Ancients?

   [Prior One does not react.]

     DANIEL

     (stuttering)
     L-look the point is, we meant no harm. Um, we're explorers.

     PRIOR ONE
     You know of others in Ver Ager?

     DANIEL
     Others?

     PRIOR ONE
     Unbelievers.

     VALA

     (moving around table)
     Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want us to tell on people who don't believe in
     the Ori?

     PRIOR ONE
     Devotion is rewarded.

   [Vala glances at Daniel in alarm before turning back to the Prior.]

     PRIOR ONE

     (continuing)
     Those who stray must be guided back to the path.

     VALA

     (skeptical)
     Seems to me those who stray get burned to death.

     PRIOR ONE
     The Ori gave all men and women free will.

   [Vala approaches and circles Prior One. Daniel stays seated, following
   the conversation closely.]

     VALA
     If the Ori are so powerful, why do they need us to tell them who
     believes in them and who doesn't?

     PRIOR ONE
     The Ori need nothing from us.

     DANIEL

     (smiling to himself)
     It is we who must seek the truth of the universe in order to achieve
     enlightenment.

   [Vala looks at Daniel. He shrugs slightly.]

     DANIEL
     Been down this road before.

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Mitchell is sitting in a chair, looking down into the isolation room,
   where Lam and medical staff are monitoring Daniel and Vala. The
   communication device is by the foot of their beds, glowing. Lee is
   sitting by the device, working on something. Landry approaches
   Mitchell's side. Mitchell starts to rise.]

     LANDRY
     At ease, Colonel. How are they doing?

     MITCHELL
     There's no change, sir.

     LANDRY
     I know you're concerned for them. So am I, but I've got something
     else for you to do.

     MITCHELL
     Sir?

   [Landry pulls up a chair and sits next to Mitchell.]

     LANDRY
     Just got a report from Dr. Lindsay on P3X-421.

     MITCHELL

     (thinking)
     Lindsay...anthropologist, right?

     LANDRY

     (nodding)
     She's been working with the human population on 421, helping them
     get over the loss of their former false god.

     MITCHELL
     Trouble?

     LANDRY
     Well, it seems a missionary of sorts came through the Gate yesterday
     and started spouting a religion we haven't encountered before--I
     mean, not that we have a problem with people exploring different
     faiths.

     MITCHELL

     (still concentrating on Daniel and Vala)
     I suspect we'll see a lot of opportunists try to fill the void by
     the Goa'uld, sir.

     LANDRY
     Hmm. This new found freedom is quickly going to bring about
     desperation if people don't learn to fend for themselves. A lot of
     these, uh shall we say, "sheltered civilizations" could potentially
     be taken advantage of by a charlatan with a flashy bag of tricks.

     MITCHELL

     (looking at Landry)
     And in this case?

     LANDRY

     (scoffing)
     Well, this missionary's apparently trying to prove the validity of
     his claims by performing miracles.

     MITCHELL
     Miracles?

   [Landry stands. Mitchell immediately follows suit in the presence of
   his superior officer.]

     LANDRY
     I'd like you take SG-12 and check it out.

   [Mitchell glances a couple more times through the window before
   responding.]

     MITCHELL
     Yes, sir.

   INT--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

     PRIOR ONE

     (in monotone)
     ...Amica was forgiven his transgression and found his way back to
     the path.

   [Daniel is still seated at the end of the table by the open book. Vala
   is seated in a chair next to him, her head leaning on her hand in
   boredom.]

     VALA
     I can't take much more of this.

     DANIEL
     Um, sorry to interrupt, but um, if you brought us here to try and
     convert us, I think it's fair to tell you that we're really not in
     the market for "new gods."

     PRIOR ONE
     The will of the Ori brought you here.

     DANIEL

     (offhand)
     I don't suppose we could talk to one of these "Ori"?

     PRIOR ONE
     Of course.

   [Daniel and Vala both stand upright, surprised at this response.]

     DANIEL

     (stuttering)
     Uh, well great. Th-th-that would be great.

     PRIOR ONE
     Speak, and they shall hear you.

   [Daniel and Vala realize the Prior is referring to prayer and sigh.]

     DANIEL
     Oh.

     VALA

     Okay look, you can torture us all you want with your rhetoric, but
     we're not going to crack--Well, I might--But we're not going to tell
     you anything because we don't know anything.
     (turns to Daniel)
     Am I right?

     DANIEL

     Uh, can I talk to your boss? Um, the uh...uh...
     (flips through book)
     The Doci, um, the one who speaks the word of the Ori.

   [The Prior turns his attention to Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (reading from text)
     Uh..."like Egidius of Vil Dare, I need to speak things that can only
     be spoken in the light of fire."

   [He looks at Prior One hopefully.]

     PRIOR ONE
     Come with me.

   [The doors open and Prior One walks out. Daniel and Vala follow.]

     VALA

     (to Daniel)
     Could you not have asked that an hour ago? We've been listening to
     him drone on and on...

     PRIOR ONE
     Not you.

   [Vala stops walking just inside the threshold.]

     VALA
     What? Not who? Not me? But I...

   [Daniel turns back and sees the doors close on Vala's face as she
   sighs. Daniel follows the Prior.]

     VALA

     (through closed door)
     I-I'll wait here.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A color guard of Jaffa step through an active Stargate. Teal'c and
   Landry stand at the bottom of the ramp. Armed SFs are scattered
   throughout the room. Gerak steps through the Stargate with his aide
   Yat'yir. Gerak wears a full Jaffa military uniform with a fur cape.]

     LANDRY

     (low, to Teal'c)
     Quite the entourage.

   [Landry leaves Teal'c's side and walks up the ramp to greet Gerak. He
   holds out his right hand for Gerak to shake.]

     LANDRY
     Welcome.

   [Gerak pauses, studying both Landry and Teal'c, who still stands at the
   ramp's base, before taking Landry's hand. Teal'c watches stoically,
   glaring at Gerak.]

   EXT--P3X-421, DAY

   [The villagers are all gathered around Prior Two, who is reading from
   his book.]

     PRIOR TWO

     "...as he lay there, dying in the sun, the sands of the desert all
     around him, Petrus spoke to the rock, not with his lips, but with
     his mind. And the rock wept tears of fresh water, and his thirst was
     quenched."
     (closing book)
     Fear not the Ori. Fear the darkness that would conceal the knowledge
     of the universe. Believe in the truth of all things, and you too may
     find the path to enlightenment.

   [Behind Prior Two, Mitchell, Lindsay, and SG-12 approach from the
   Stargate.]

     MITCHELL
     "And a man has no greater thing under the sun than to eat, drink and
     be merry." Ecclesiastes. My favorite.

   [The Prior turns at their approach. Mitchell continues with a disarming
   smile, his voice taking on a bit of a Southern drawl.]

     MITCHELL

     My grandma was a bit of a bible thumper. Weekends at Grandma's meant
     long, long Sundays at St. Hilda's Church of the Grand Epiphany.
     (normal voice)
     Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell. How you doing?

     PRIOR TWO
     I am a Prior of the Ori.

     MITCHELL
     It's nice to meet you.

   [The Prior passes Mitchell and heads in the direction of the Stargate.]

     PRIOR TWO
     Your arrival here was foreseen.

     MITCHELL
     No kidding. So, you see the future, do you?

     PRIOR TWO
     Lessons of days gone by teach us what will come to pass.

     MITCHELL
     I'm a bit of a history buff myself. Doesn't help me pick the lotto
     numbers, though. So, where're you from?

     PRIOR TWO
     Where we come from and where we are going are all the same.

     MITCHELL

     Oh, I get you. "Wherever you go, there you are."
     (aside to Lindsay)
     Think that's Buckaroo Banzai.
     (to Prior)
     Me, I'm from a little planet called Earth.

     PRIOR TWO
     The home of Daniel Jackson.

   [Mitchell makes a sideways glance at Lindsay.]

     LINDSAY

     (nervous)
     He never mentioned that before.

   [Mitchell turns back to the Prior, and they appraise each other.]

     MITCHELL

     (after a pause)
     You know Doctor Jackson, do you?

     PRIOR TWO
     From him did we learn of your need.

     MITCHELL
     Our need for what?

     PRIOR TWO
     The revelation of your destiny.

   EXT--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY

   INT--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [A set of tall doors opens, revealing the interior of the chamber. A
   statue of an ankh-like symbol with a light purple smooth oval stone
   sits between two pillars at the far end. It is otherwise unfurnished.
   The Doci stands in front of this symbol. One side of the room is
   decorated with a tall, ornate, cast iron fence, a double gate in its
   center. Beyond this fence is a wall of fire. Prior One and Daniel enter
   the room.]

     PRIOR ONE
     Doci.

   [The Doci turns from the symbol and faces Daniel. He is dressed in a
   long, high necked, white robe. On top of the robe is a full length,
   silver, patterned adornment similar in shape to the ankh symbol with a
   small purple stone set near the chest; the decoration continues past
   the robe and surrounds either side of the Doci's head like a collar.
   Like the Prior, his face is powder white, and his eyes have a milky,
   off color cast. His face is scarred in a purposeful way, with
   deliberate markings.]

     DOCI
     Leave us.

   [Prior One exits the chamber; the doors close behind him. Daniel half
   turns to watch the Prior's movements, gathering his thoughts.
   Eventually, he turns back to the Doci.]

     DANIEL

     (smiling tentatively)
     Hello. I'm uh--

     DOCI
     Daniel Jackson.

     DANIEL

     (nonplussed)
     Right.

     DOCI
     From the planet Earth.

   [Daniel blinks.]

     DANIEL
     Okay. So you know my name and where I'm from, so I assume you'll
     also know how I'm connected to this man's mind. Why I'm here...uh.
     You see, we're...we're explorers. We'd very much like to get to know
     you. Um. Your society. How you came to be.

     DOCI
     A Prior has been dispatched to the place from whence you come.

     DANIEL
     Really? You can-you can do that? I thought we were in another
     galaxy.

     DOCI
     It is the will of the Ori that we should spread Origin to all those
     blessed by their creation.

     DANIEL
     Okay, well, I think you should understand that there are many
     different kinds of people in the place "from whence I
     come"...um...people who believe in many different things.

     DOCI
     They shall find the path to enlightenment.

     DANIEL
     Right. Well I-I think you should also understand that they may not
     see your way as the only way.

     DOCI
     The power and the greatness of the Ori cannot be denied. Those who
     reject the path to enlightenment must be destroyed.

     DANIEL
     Right. I was afraid of that.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Landry and Teal'c escort Gerak and Yat'yir around a corner and down
   the hallway. Landry and Gerak converse while Teal'c and Yat'yir size
   each other up.]

     LANDRY
     George Washington, one of our country's founding fathers and first
     president, once said: "True friendship is a plant of slow growth,
     and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is
     entitled to the appellation."

     GERAK
     The First Prime of Horus, Karrok of the High Plains, once said:
     "There is more honor in dying at the hands of a brother than there
     is killing a would-be friend."

   [Teal'c, standing behind Landry, clenches his jaw. Landry considers
   this statement for a moment before responding.]

     LANDRY
     He was a wise man.

     GERAK
     He was killed shortly after losing one of the greatest battles in
     history.

     LANDRY

     (lightly)
     Oh. Well, I hope it wasn't his brother that shot him.

     GERAK
     It was me. The Jaffa was a fool in every respect. He did not deserve
     an honorable death.

     LANDRY

     (soberly)
     I see.

   [Klaxons blare and a strobe light comes on in the hallway.]

     HARRIMAN

     (over loudspeaker)
     Unscheduled incoming wormhole.

     LANDRY

     (chuckles uncomfortably)
     I better see what this is about. Uh, Teal'c, please escort our
     guests to the briefing room.

   [Landry makes a formal bow in the manner Teal'c often does. Gerak nods
   casually in return.]

   INT--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

     DOCI
     The Book of Origin says: "those who seek the path to enlightenment
     must not be led astray."

     DANIEL
     Right. See that can be interpreted a number of different ways. I
     think maybe I know what the Ori are--uh--who they are, um, and I'm
     not denying they are very powerful beings, but if I'm right, they're
     not gods. If they're like the ascended beings I know, they simply
     have a greater understanding of the knowledge of the universe.

     DOCI
     What is a god, but a being that is worshiped by those beneath? Is
     great knowledge, power, understanding not enough for you to revere
     the Ori?

     DANIEL

     Respect, yes, certainly. But that doesn't mean I would murder
     innocent people in their name. I guess what I'm trying to understand
     is whether the Ori have spoken to you directly and told you to
     worship them, or whether you've...misinterpreted some evidence
     you've found along the way and developed this religion on your own.
     I can't speak for everyone in my galaxy, but in my own humble
     opinion, I don't believe that any individual or society can achieve
     enlightenment through fear-mongering and forced servitude, no matter
     what power is presented as evidence. That's something the ascended
     beings I know very clearly seem to understand.
     Don't get me wrong, I mean, we should all be trying to better
     ourselves. I mean if-if ascension is the ultimate end we're trying
     to achieve, then so be it, but we should all be allowed to get there
     or not of our own free will. You can kill me for saying that, but
     that is what I believe and nothing you say or do will EVER change my
     mind.

   [Daniel waits nervously for the Doci's response.]

     DOCI

     (after a pause)
     Come.

   [The Doci goes to the gate and opens it. Daniel follows warily. They
   step out onto a balcony.]

     DOCI
     The Ori hear you.

   [Daniel looks down. The wall of fire extends as far as the eye can see.
   The Doci spreads his arms wide, and a white brightness appears in front
   of him. Daniel steps back in alarm. Strings of flames shoot out,
   passing Daniel, who cringes at their approach. The strings of flame
   enter the Doci. The Doci turns, and looks at Daniel through flame
   filled eyes. He begins to speak in an echoing voice that sounds like
   many voices speaking in unison behind the voice of the Doci.]

     POSSESSED DOCI
     We do not require blind faith. Only that you believe what you see
     and know to be true.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c is already seated. Landry stands by a chair at the head of the
   table. Gerak has draped his fur cape over the back of a chair and is
   pacing around the room. Yat'yir stands near him. Harriman places
   folders by every seat.]

     LANDRY
     I realize this is just a friendly meeting. But on behalf of our
     planet's leaders, I've been asked to present a few thoughts for you
     to consider. Uh, some points that we can discuss in the future.
     Possibly looking forward to an official treaty between our world and
     the Jaffa nation.

   [Gerak looks through the briefing room window into the Gate room.]

     GERAK
     Who is that?

   [Landry stands to join Gerak at the window. He looks down to see
   Mitchell, SG-12, and Prior Two coming out of the active Stargate.]

     LANDRY

     (sighing)
     Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, SG-12, and a gentleman we encountered
     on another planet who claims that he represents some gods called the
     Ori. I think we have yet to see the real fallout from dismantling
     the infrastructure established by the Goa'uld.

     GERAK
     Indeed. We have already seen the rise of individuals and
     organizations who have threatened to challenge us.

   [Yat'yir turns to stare at Teal'c, who returns the stare.]

     LANDRY
     There are as many humans out there as there are Jaffa. But if we
     don't continue to work together, the victory that we both worked so
     long and hard for could result in chaos.

   [Gerak looks down at the Gate room again before striding back to his
   seat.]

   INT--DOCI CHAMBER BALCONY, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

     POSSESSED DOCI
     We are Ori.

     DANIEL
     And you instruct these people to worship you?

     POSSESSED DOCI
     We are their creators. All who follow the path will join us in
     enlightenment.

     DANIEL
     Do you know who the Alterans are?

     POSSESSED DOCI
     Those who abandon the path are evil.

     DANIEL
     Evil? Why?

     POSSESSED DOCI
     They shielded you.

     DANIEL

     (flatly)
     Really. I didn't really think they did much of anything for us, but
     I guess I was wrong.

     POSSESSED DOCI
     The truth of the universe has been obstructed. All will know the
     power of the Ori.

   [Daniel blinks and takes a deep breath, very worried. The strings of
   flame shoot out from the Doci's chest and return to the wall of fire.]

     DOCI

     (in normal voice)
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Lam checks Daniel's heart with her stethoscope. Lee hovers nearby.
   Satisfied, Lam places the stethoscope back around her neck.]

     LAM
     Vitals are returning to normal.

     LEE
     I wonder what that was all about.

     LAM

     (checking the monitors for both patients)
     I don't know, but he was in some sort of stress.

   [Lee looks up to the observation room, where Mitchell and Prior Two are
   entering.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Mitchell and Prior Two look down into the isolation room. Mitchell
   stands with his hands crossed over his chest.]

     MITCHELL
     We can't seem to disconnect the stones or turn off the device.

     PRIOR TWO
     It is the will of the Ori.

     MITCHELL
     I figured you might say that. You sure there's nothing you can do?
     If you help us out here, I'll guarantee we'll be more receptive to
     those stories you want to tell. Call it a miracle if you want.

     PRIOR TWO
     When Hannor Mir fell from above and learned to fly on the way
     down...that was a miracle.

     MITCHELL
     Right.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teal'c, Landry, Gerak, and Yat'yir are seated around the briefing
   table.]

     YAT'YIR
     These planets you have mentioned. All have plentiful naquadah mines
     on them.

     TEAL'C
     And substantial human populations.

     YAT'YIR
     Whose side are you on, Jaffa?

   [Teal'c leans forward in his chair.]

     LANDRY
     There are no sides here. Just topics of conversation.

     GERAK
     I wish to meet this Prior of the Ori. If he preaches faith in false
     gods, then that is a concern for all of us. I wish to hear his
     claims and challenge him.

   [Teal'c, Landry, and Gerak all exchange looks.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [Daniel walks ahead of Prior One, heading to the doors at the end of
   the corridor, which open at their approach. Daniel enters the dining
   room where Vala waits. Prior One turns away from them as the door
   closes, standing guard at the entrance.]

   INT--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [Vala stands by a large wooden cabinet near the windows. Daniel circles
   the table to join her.]

     VALA
     What's going on?

     DANIEL
     This is bad.

     VALA
     Worse than being burned to death?

     DANIEL
     It appears our ascended Ancients and the Ori have a slight
     difference of opinion. See the Ori seem to think that because
     they're ascended, humans beings should worship them. All humans.

     VALA
     And if we don't?

     DANIEL
     Then we're not worthy of living and should be destroyed.

     VALA
     I don't think enlightenment means what they think it means.

     DANIEL
     See, apparently our ascended Ancients have been shielding our
     existence from the Ori.

     VALA
     They've been protecting us?

     DANIEL
     The Ori seem to think that our Ancients are evil because they
     haven't shared the secrets of the universe with us.

     VALA
     Well, I hate secrets--at least, the ones I don't know.

     DANIEL
     See, the problem is the Ori now know our galaxy's inhabited by
     humans because of US!

   [Daniel gestures angrily between Vala and himself. Vala points back at
   him.]

     VALA
     I refuse to accept the blame for that. Curiosity is part of human
     nature. Look, if the Ancients knew that the Ori were so bad, why
     didn't they stop us from coming here?

     DANIEL
     Free will.

     VALA

     Right.
     (pauses)
     If they have been protecting us, there's no reason to believe they
     won't continue.

     DANIEL
     The Ancients may be protecting us from the Ori, but not their human
     followers. See, Ancients won't interfere on any lower planes of
     existence. If anybody from our galaxy wants to worship the Ori,
     apparently, that's our choice. And they won't stop Priors from
     coming through the Gate because apparently, they've already sent
     one.

     VALA
     The Ori have given Priors special powers and that's not fair.

     DANIEL
     They're still human. Now, highly evolved humans can have some pretty
     amazing abilities. They're using the secrets of the universe that
     the Ori have given them to spread word of the Ori's godliness. And
     when people don't see the light, it's going to be--

   [Daniel makes a cutting motion across his throat with his hand.]

     VALA

     (despairing)
     What are we going to do?

     DANIEL
     I don't know. I'm starting to think that sending Priors is just the
     beginning. We could be talking Crusade here. We need to warn Earth.

     VALA
     We need to get out of these people.

   INT--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [Prior One walks up behind the Doci, who is staring out at the wall of
   fire. The Doci turns to face him.]

     DOCI
     Take the unbelievers back to Ver Ager. Let its cleansing mark
     forever the beginning of a new age. Evil has raised a great many
     unbelievers in a far-off place. They must be shown the path.

     PRIOR ONE
     Hallowed are the Ori.

     DOCI
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   [Prior One bows and leaves the chamber.]

   EXT--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, DAY

   [Villagers wander through the square on their daily business. None seem
   upset or bothered by the immolation they witnessed earlier.]

   INT--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

   [Daniel and Vala stand in the main room of the house and look out the
   window at the village.]

     VALA
     What are we doing? Why did he bring us back here?

   [They turn away from the window and move further into the room.]

     DANIEL
     I think he's using us to weed out any other heretics that might be
     here.

     VALA
     I still don't get why the Ori just don't do it themselves. They're
     supposed to be gods. Aren't gods all seeing, all knowing, all
     powerful?

     DANIEL
     Well, the universe is infinite, remember? Apparently, that's a lot
     to keep track of.

     VALA
     I suppose.

     DANIEL
     They didn't even know about our galaxy...well, until recently.

   [Daniel stands still, lost in thought. Vala notices his silence.]

     VALA

     (in a comforting tone)
     It's not our fault.

   [Vala stands in front of the mirror and gestures at her reflection,
   which is the image of Sallis.]

     VALA

     (appearing as Sallis)
     You'd think at least they'd keep on top of their own people.

   [Daniel crosses the room to look back out of the window. As he crosses
   past the mirror, the image of Harrid reflects in the mirror.]

     DANIEL

     (appearing as Harrid)
     I get the feeling the Ori let their devout followers...

     DANIEL
     ...do their enforcing for them. It confirms their loyalty.

     VALA

     (leaning against a pillar)
     Okay, why did we let the Prior bring us back here?

     DANIEL
     Well, because I don't think he was going to give us much choice. And
     besides, I'm starting to think that that might be our best way to
     contact Earth and warn them about what we know.

     VALA
     How?

     DANIEL
     Well, Fannis said that his sect had found other artifacts.

     VALA
     You think they also have a terminal device to go with the stones.

     DANIEL
     If they do and we can find it and hook up the stones, maybe we can
     get this communication thing going both ways.

     VALA
     Right. If the Prior is using us to weed out other unbelievers, how
     do we make contact with Fannis without giving him away?

     DANIEL
     We can't.

   [Both Daniel and Vala look troubled.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Prior Two is standing. Landry, Teal'c, Gerak, and Yat'yir all sit at
   the table. SFs guard every entrance to the room. Mitchell stands
   between where Teal'c and Landry are seated.]

     PRIOR TWO
     You do not believe in a higher power?

     LANDRY
     Well, it's complicated. There are a lot of different points of view
     about that subject around here.

     TEAL'C
     Jaffa have recently shed the dominance of false gods that have
     enslaved us for many generations.

     GERAK
     But many have long believed in the path to enlightenment.

   [Teal'c observes Gerak with interest.]

     PRIOR TWO
     Origin will guide you on this path. And those who revere its wisdom
     shall be uplifted. I have come to spread the word to the unbelievers
     who have been sheltered and raised by evil.

     MITCHELL

     (leaning down and speaking softly to Landry)
     You have no idea how much he sounds like my Grandma.

   EXT--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, NIGHT

   [Birds sing. A large white moon shines through the clouds to light the
   valley and village.]

   INT--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

   [Vala and Daniel are standing in the bedroom. Vala struggles with the
   clasp of a cloak. Daniel is across the room by the wardrobe, adjusting
   his own cloak.]

     VALA
     It's a pretty big village. I suspect that Fannis and his gang did a
     reasonable job hiding their sacrilegious artifacts.

     DANIEL
     Well, we have to do something.

   [There is a knock at a door which leads outside. Vala goes to the
   window. Daniel reaches in the wardrobe and retrieves a heavy metal
   vase. He looks at Vala. She looks out the window and sees a lone hooded
   figure holding a lamp. She is unable to identify who it is. She shakes
   her head at Daniel and shrugs. He opens the door, staying out of sight
   behind it. Fannis enters, smiling as soon as he sees Vala and throwing
   back his hood. Daniel comes up behind him, about to strike him down
   with the vase.]

     VALA

     (waving frantically)
     No no no!

   [Daniel holds back at the last moment as Fannis turns and cringes.]

     DANIEL

     (gasping in irritation)
     Fannis!

   [Fannis sighs in relief. Daniel pushes him further into the room and
   shuts the door.]

     DANIEL
     You shouldn't have come. They're using us to get to you.

     FANNIS
     So I suspected. Either that, or you have truly come to see the power
     of the Ori.

     VALA
     Not bloody likely.

     DANIEL

     (earnest pleading)
     You have to leave.

   [Fannis clasps his hand on Daniel's shoulder.]

     FANNIS
     If I can help you speak the reality of our existence to your people,
     maybe one day in turn, you will spread that word back here.

   [Daniel considers this, then nods to Vala. She turns and goes to get
   the book containing the black Ancient communication stones from its
   hiding place at the bed.]

     DANIEL
     You said you had other artifacts besides the stones.

     FANNIS

     (smiling)
     I'll show you.

     DANIEL
     No! Just tell me! Now, we're looking for a large dome-shaped object
     with a blue crystal on top. The stones fit inside of it.

     FANNIS

     (smiles)
     Come.

   [He turns to the door.]

     DANIEL

     (pleading)
     Fannis! You're risking your life.

   [Fannis turns back and approaches Daniel, speaking in a serious,
   earnest tone.]

     FANNIS
     Harrid, Sallis, and I, all those who believe as we do, have known
     for some time that we may give our lives for our cause. We can only
     hope one day the truth comes to bear as a result.

   [He turns back and walks to the door. Vala and Daniel exchange looks.
   Vala hands Daniel the book. Daniel hands Vala the vase. They don their
   hoods and follow Fannis.]

   EXT--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, NIGHT

   [An older man leaves an alley and walks into the main street. He passes
   three hooded figures. They are Daniel, Fannis, and Vala. Looking around
   to make sure no one is watching, the three walk down the alley to a
   small doorway.]

   INT--HIDDEN ROOM, VILLAGE OF VER AGER

   [Fannis and Daniel uncover and open a wooden crate. Nestled inside is
   an Ancient communication device, identical to the one at the SGC. Vala
   and Fannis grin at each other. Daniel takes the black stones out of the
   book, which he hands to Fannis. He hands one stone to Vala. They both
   stand over the device.]

     DANIEL
     And...

   [Vala and Daniel place the stones on the device.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Lee is standing close to Daniel's monitors. A nurse observes Vala's.
   Lee sees a spike in a reading.]

     LEE
     Whoa, uh, something just happened.

   [Lam bends over Daniel and uses her penlight to check for dilation
   response in his eyes. She places her fingers around his throat to check
   other vitals. Daniel grabs her wrist and opens his eyes, looking around
   warily.]

   INT--HIDDEN ROOM, VILLAGE OF VER AGER

   [Fannis smiles. Harrid and Sallis stand up straight from being hunched
   over the communication device. They look at each other and smile.
   Fannis continues grinning, then makes a choked sound in his throat,
   leaning back. Prior One comes down a staircase into the room, the blue
   orb of his staff glowing brightly. The Ancient communication device
   shuts off. Daniel is once again inside Harrid.]

     DANIEL
     Fannis?

   [Prior One reaches the bottom of the staircase. Fannis drops to his
   knees, unable to breathe. Vala, back in Sallis's body, spins to see
   what Fannis is staring at and spots the Prior. The Prior raises his
   hand and telekinetically throws Daniel through the air, knocking the
   breath out of him when he impacts the wall. Daniel is unable to move
   and is pinned three feet above the floor. Fannis collapses onto his
   back, still gasping for air.]

     PRIOR ONE
     And the people shall deliver the wicked unto your divine judgment,
     where their sins shall be weighed in balance with all that is just
     and true.

   [Vala stares at Prior One. Fannis becomes limp and stops breathing
   entirely. Daniel remains pinned and appears in pain.]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [A group of villagers drag Vala and Daniel into the square. Both have
   their hands tied in front of them. Vala is being carried, one villager
   holding her by the waist, one by her legs. She kicks and twists her
   body, trying to break free. Two other villagers struggle with Daniel,
   who's also fighting against them. Following behind them is Prior One,
   walking in his slow, processional gait.]

     VALA

     (desperately)
     The Ori are great! I love the Ori! I'm a believer! What's the matter
     with you people? I'm telling you, I've seen the light!
     (calling over to Daniel)
     I don't think they're buying it.

     DANIEL
     Well, I've heard you do better.

   [Daniel twists free enough to elbow one of the villagers restraining
   him. The other villager maintains his hold, and the first punches
   Daniel in the gut, doubling him over and making him cry out in pain.
   The villagers wrestle them both into the circular, maze like stone
   structure where Vala was sacrificed before. They are forced to their
   knees, with their hands shackled behind them on opposite sides of the
   yoke like bench in the center of the maze. Vala grunts in resistence. A
   large crowd gathers around. The Administrator walks along the edge of
   the pattern.]

     ADMINISTRATOR
     Glorious are the Ori, who lead us to salvation, who didst fight the
     evil that would doom us to mortal sin. Did they defeat the old
     spirits and cast them out. And now, with the strength of our will,
     they do call upon us to prevail against the corruption of all
     unbelievers.

     VALA

     (gulping)
     Well, second time's the charm.

   [Daniel twists his head to look back at her in disbelief.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     PRIOR TWO
     The Ori do not shield this knowledge as others might, selfish in
     their powerful advantage. They lead you to their realm in the path
     that is laid out in The Book of Origin. All you need do is follow
     their teachings.

   [Harriman enters the room and whispers in Landry's ear. Landry rises.]

     LANDRY

     I'm very sorry. You'll have to excuse us for a moment. Please
     continue.
     (to Mitchell)
     Colonel.

   [Landry and Mitchell follow Harriman out of the room.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIEFING ROOM

   [Lam is standing in the corridor, waiting to talk to them.]

     LAM
     They woke up just for a moment, and then they lost consciousness
     again.

   [Landry sighs in disappointment.]

     MITCHELL
     Did they say anything?

     LAM
     Yes, they did.

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

     ADMINISTRATOR
     Guide us on the path, so that we may triumph over the enemy of our
     salvation, and be with you in the end of ends on the Plains of
     Enlightenment.

   [As the Administrator speaks, Prior One takes a prominent place among
   the crowd. Daniel glances at the crowd. Vala fights back tears. Both
   look resigned.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Mitchell enters the room and draws his sidearm, pointing it at Prior
   Two. Following him are other armed SFs. The guards already stationed in
   the room react to their colleagues by also aiming their weapons at
   Prior Two. Gerak and Yat'yir stand. Teal'c remains seated.]

     GERAK

     (angrily)
     What's the meaning of this?

     LANDRY
     I'm very sorry. We've just received some information about our
     visitor here that demands we take every precaution.

     MITCHELL
     We'll have to take the staff, sir.

   [He motions to an SF, who reaches out, grabs the staff, and moves
   several feet away.]

     MITCHELL
     And you'll have to come with us.

     GERAK
     I demand to know what you've learned.

     PRIOR TWO

     (reasonably)
     All I wish to do is spread the word of the Ori to your world.

     LANDRY
     Actually, that was never going to happen.

     PRIOR TWO
     Then I must leave at once.

     MITCHELL
     That's not going to happen, either.

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

     PRIOR ONE

   bucket of flammable fluid ignites on its own.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     PRIOR TWO
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   [Prior Two reaches out his hand, and his staff flies out of the SF's
   grasp into his own. The blue orb at the top shines with a bright glow.
   Teal'c stands.]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [Villagers tip the bucket, and the fiery fluid drains into the track
   that channels through the circular maze. Vala, facing the fire, and
   Daniel twisting around, both watch its progress with alarm.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Prior Two bursts into flame. Everyone else rears back in
   astonishment.]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [The fiery liquid has already tracked through most of the maze and
   quickly approaches the center. Daniel and Vala each try to stay as
   close to the center as possible, cringing against the heat of the
   flames.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Prior Two stands calmly as the fire engulfs him, then disappears, the
   flames rising into nothingness. Everyone left in the room stares at the
   smoke; there is no other trace of Prior Two.]

     VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER
     Code Blue. Medical Emergency in Observation Lab One. Repeat. Code
     Blue.

   [Mitchell sets the safety on his sidearm and runs out of the room.
   Teal'c follows.]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [Daniel begins to gasp for breath. Vala shudders and tries to make
   herself smaller. Prior One and the villagers watch impassively as the
   flames inch closer.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Mitchell and Teal'c enter, followed by an SF. Medical staff and Lee
   swarm around Daniel and Vala, who are in distress. Monitors are beeping
   rapidly and erratically.]

     LAM
     Same as before, only this time, it's both of them.

   [Mitchell and Teal'c head to the communication device. Lee spots where
   they're going and tries to head them off.]

     LEE
     Now, now, hold on. This device draws its power directly from
     subspace. It will react very badly to an explosion. You can't blow
     it up.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps we should send it through the Stargate?

     MITCHELL
     Genius.

   [Mitchell and Teal'c unhook the device from the leads attaching it to
   the monitoring equipment. Lee is forced to duck when Mitchell and
   Teal'c lift the device and start carrying it. Once the device passes
   over his head, Lee stands and follows. All the while, Lee protests
   their actions.]

     LEE
     No. Well, it also uses subspace to communicate with another galaxy
     across the universe. I mean, there's no reason to believe that
     Daniel and Vala won't stay connected to it, even from another
     planet.

     MITCHELL
     I have a different idea. Tell them to start dialing the Gate.

   [Teal'c and Mitchell hurry from the room with the device. Lee stops at
   the door.]

     LEE

     (calling after them)
     Where to?

     MITCHELL

     (calling back)
     Wherever.

     LEE

     (muttering to himself)
     Wherever? Where...All right.

   [Lee shrugs, picks up the phone and starts dialing]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   Vala's backs are practically touching each other as they lean away from
   the flames. They are both gasping for air.]

   spins and a second chevron locks into place.]

     Out of the way! Out. Of. The. Way!

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   gasping for oxygen, panicking at the flames surrounding them. They
   strain against the shackles to no effect. Prior One watches these
   events with no reaction.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The computer screen confirms the encoding of a sixth chevron.]

     HARRIMAN
     Chevron Six encoded.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate's inner ring spins.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Mitchell and Teal'c continue to run while carrying the device.]

     MITCHELL

     (yelling)
     Not yet, Walter! Not yet!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Landry places a hand on Harriman's shoulder. Harriman presses a button
   on his control panel.]

     HARRIMAN
     Halting dialing sequence.

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [Vala and Daniel are helpless against the surrounding flames.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [A heart monitor shows a flat line, sounding a steady whine. Lam
   listens to Vala's heart with her stethoscope.]

     LEE
     Blood pressure's dropping. The heart rate's rising. They're going
     into shock!

   INT--SGC CORRIDORS

   [Teal'c and Mitchell spin around a corner and run down the corridor
   with the device, dodging personnel as they turn and enter the Gate
   room.]

     MITCHELL

     (as he passes through the door)
     Now!

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Resuming dialing sequence. Chevron Seven, locked!

   [The computer monitor confirms the seventh chevron locking.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Mitchell and Teal'c heave the Ancient communication device into the
   air just as the wormhole activates. The device disappears into the
   Kawoosh, disintegrating. Mitchell and Teal'c dive to the floor at the
   bottom of the gate ramp.]

   EXT--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

   [Daniel and Vala can hardly breathe through the flames and smoke. In
   the next instant, it is Harrid and Sallis in their spots, struggling as
   the flames surround them. They appear terrified and distraught.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

     LAM
     Charging to 200.

   [A nurse squirts gel on defibrillator paddles Lam is holding. Lam
   spreads the gel by rubbing the two paddles together and moves towards
   Daniel, who's in full cardiac arrest.]

     LAM
     Clear!

   [Daniel's scrub shirt has been cut open, a couple of monitor leads are
   stuck to his chest. As Lam reaches down with the paddles, Daniel's eyes
   open. Lam halts moments before she shocks him. Daniel looks around
   wildly. Vala is being attended to by Lee. She wakes up suddenly,
   half-rising from the bed and gasping for air. Lee looks at her in
   shock, then smiles. Lam turns at her gasp and appraises their condition
   by looking at the monitors. The monitors beep erratically, then
   gradually the beeping smoothes to steady intervals. Daniel looks at
   Vala. Vala leans on her elbows and looks around in a panicked manner,
   putting a hand to her throat as she tries to take in oxygen. She looks
   towards Daniel.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c and Mitchell stand and look up at the control room.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The phone rings. Landry moves to answer it.]

     LANDRY
     General Landry.

   [He listens on the phone for a minute, then hangs up and walks back and
   looks through the window at Mitchell and Teal'c.]

     LANDRY

     (through intercom microphone)
     Dr. Lam says that Daniel and Vala have regained consciousness. Well
     done!

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c nods in acknowledgment and gives a small smile.]

     MITCHELL

     (gesturing with his arms wide)
     See, THAT'S what I'm talking about.

   [Teal'c and Mitchell grasp each other by the arm in congratulations.]

   EXT--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY

   INT--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

   [The Doci stands at the balcony, looking out at the wall of fire.
   Behind him in the room, Prior One and the Administrator approach. When
   the Administrator draws near, he bows low. The Doci turns to
   acknowledge him.]

     DOCI
     You have served the Ori well.

     ADMINISTRATOR

     (bowing head)
     I bow in humble account.

     DOCI
     Come, and gaze upon the flames of enlightenment.

   [The Doci moves to the side and gestures. The Administrator approaches
   with humble trepidation and stands beside him on the balcony. Prior One
   watches.]

     DOCI
     Let its power wash over you.

   [The Doci steps back. The Administrator spreads his arms wide, and a
   white brightness appears. The Doci and Prior One look on as the
   Administrator staggers slightly at the impact of the power from the
   Ori. His black hair whitens, his skin pales, and his eyes take on a
   milky countenance. He now looks identical to the Priors. He lowers his
   arms and turns to the Doci.]

     DOCI

     (snarling)
     Great holy armies shall be gathered and trained to fight all who
     embrace evil. In the name of the gods, ships shall be built to carry
     our warriors out amongst the stars, and we will spread Origin to all
     the unbelievers. The power of the Ori will be felt far and wide, and
     the wicked shall be vanquished.

     ADMINISTRATOR/PRIOR THREE

     (bowing head)
     Hallowed are the Ori.

     DOCI
     Hallowed are the Ori.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is standing by the center worktable, wearing green BDU's.
   Teal'c stands beside him, also wearing SGC garb. Vala, dressed in a
   blue air force jumpsuit, is sitting on the table. Daniel's right arm is
   outstretched. Vala holds a red crystal over his wrist, and the Goa'uld
   kor mak bracelet releases and uncurls, balancing straight on top of his
   wrist. Daniel picks up the bracelet while she repeats the process on
   her own wrist.]

     DANIEL

     (softly)
     Thank you.

   [Vala gives him a small quiet smile. Mitchell appears at the doorway.]

     MITCHELL

     (leaning on door frame)
     General Landry is ready for us.

   [Teal'c nods and smiles at Mitchell in acknowledgment. The three exit
   the room.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Daniel, Vala, Teal'c, and Mitchell are seated at the table. Landry
   paces the room, studying the pattern of the etched star chart window.
   Vala's body language has changed from her previously brazen, confident
   manner. She sits huddled, her knees against her chest, arms wrapped
   around her legs. Daniel sits beside her, his elbows leaning on the
   armrests, fingers interlaced in a contemplative gesture. Mitchell is
   sitting in a relaxed, casual posture, leaning back slightly. Teal'c is
   sitting stoically next to him.]

     LANDRY
     So you think we should expect more of these Priors to show up?

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     I would be very surprised if they didn't.

   [Landry sits at the head of the table and Mitchell leans forward in his
   chair.]

     MITCHELL
     How? We know one came through the Stargate, but if their galaxy is
     so far away--

     VALA

     (quietly)
     I suspect the Ori have the power to make a lot of things happen.

     DANIEL

     (shifting in his chair)
     Still, for the Priors, I think we can assume it's a one-way trip.

     MITCHELL

     (in a serious tone)
     Don't think they have a problem with self-sacrifice.

     LANDRY
     You think the Ancients here in our galaxy will continue to stop the
     Ori from using their power to attack us directly?

     DANIEL
     I hope so. I...

   [Daniel shrugs and shakes his head.]

     MITCHELL
     So how do we fight these guys? And I mean the message as much as the
     men. A lot of folks out there are going to buy what these guys are
     selling.

     TEAL'C
     Hopefully, now many have been educated to the ways of false gods.

     VALA

     (shaking her head)
     Yes, but we're not talking about humans with snakes in their heads
     with a slightly better understanding of technology.

     DANIEL
     See, their power isn't false. The Priors are going to offer to
     people what will seem like proof of God.

     LANDRY
     Proof of powerful beings is not proof of God.

     DANIEL
     I'm not saying it is.

     MITCHELL
     Look, just because we know there is some beings on a higher plane of
     existence than ourselves does not mean there's not an order of being
     higher than them. At least I reckon that's what my Grandma'd say.

     VALA

     (smiling at Daniel)
     And the universe is supposedly infinite.

   [Daniel does a double take at Vala's comment.]

     LANDRY

     Which in my book makes it's impossible to know everything. I mean,
     somewhere in there, you gotta fill in the blanks with a little
     faith.
     (smiles at Mitchell)
     I had a grandma too.

   [Teal'c smiles. Landry stands. Mitchell rises as well.]

     MITCHELL
     So, business as usual, sir?

     LANDRY

     Let `em bring it. We'll use our strengths against their weaknesses.
     That's a pretty good strategy for any kind of business you're in.
     (In a softer tone to Daniel and Vala)
     I'm glad you two are okay.

   [Daniel looks down, lost in thought. Vala looks towards the ceiling,
   shaking her head.]

     MITCHELL
     Amen.

   INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE

   [Daniel is sitting at his computer, typing on the keyboard. O'Neill, in
   full dress uniform, enters the office. Daniel looks up from typing and
   acknowledges O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Hey.

   [Daniel blinks as he realizes O'Neill is no longer a familiar presence
   at the SGC.]

     DANIEL
     Wow. What the hell are you doing here?

     O'NEILL

     (annoyed)
     Nice to see you, too.

     DANIEL

     (standing)
     No, no, sorry. It's just...I wasn't expecting to see you.

     O'NEILL
     Nah. Well, I was in the neighborhood.

   [Daniel nods, confused.]

     O'NEILL
     And I've got a little surprise for...Mitchell.

   [O'NEILL winces slightly.]

     DANIEL
     Oh. Yeah. He loved the last one. The fact that you didn't tell him
     that we were all moving on to different positions.

     O'NEILL

     (in low voice)
     Yeah.
     (pauses)
     Sorry you missed Daedalus.

     DANIEL
     No, you're not.

     O'NEILL

     (unabashed)
     You're right, I'm not.

   [There is an awkward pause.]

     O'NEILL
     Listen, I just had a briefing with Landry...about...your stuff.

     DANIEL

     (voice trails off)
     Yeah.

     O'NEILL
     Sounds like it could be a problem.

     DANIEL

     (shrugging)
     Well, we've been up against some pretty bad guys before.

     O'NEILL
     Yeah, not so pretty. Overdressed, yes.

     DANIEL
     Been through some tough situations.

     O'NEILL
     That we always won.

     DANIEL

     (with a self-conscious smile)
     Yeah...but didn't you feel that was because we had someone looking
     out for us?

   [O'Neill looks at Daniel shrewdly.]

     DANIEL
     I don't think I would say this to anyone else, but for the first
     time, I'm scared.

   [O'Neill raises his eyebrows. Daniel looks away and sighs.]

     O'NEILL

     (after a pause)
     I'm hungry.

   [Daniel looks back towards Jack, and after a moment, smiles slightly.]

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Me too.

   [O'Neill gestures towards the door with his head.]

     O'NEILL
     Wanna?

     DANIEL

     (shrugging)
     Mm-hmm.

   [They leave the office.]

   EXT--SKY, EARTH, DAY

   [An F-302 flies through the air. There are few clouds. Mitchell sits in
   the cockpit; O'Neill is behind him in the co-pilot seat.]

     MITCHELL

     (drawling)
     Yeah, man. This is good.

   [O'Neill smiles.]

     MITCHELL
     Still a rush.

     O'NEILL

     (in bored tone)
     Yeah.

     MITCHELL
     I don't know why I didn't get back on the horse sooner, except I
     really didn't think you could take one of these things for a joy
     ride.

     O'NEILL
     Now, see, that's one of the great things about being a general. You
     pretty much get to do whatever you want.

     MITCHELL
     I suppose after you've saved the world seven or eight times...

     O'NEILL

     (smirking)
     Who's counting, huh?

     MITCHELL
     Teal'c.

   [O'Neill studies Mitchell with a penetrating look.]

     MITCHELL

     (continuing)
     Actually, he mentions it quite often.

     O'NEILL
     So, Mitchell, I hear you haven't picked out your team yet.

     MITCHELL
     I'm hoping I won't have to, sir. Why, did General Landry say
     something about it, sir?

     O'NEILL
     He did.

     MITCHELL
     Are you going to tell me, sir?

     O'NEILL

     (firmly)
     He said you're going to be fine, Mitchell.

     MITCHELL

     (smiling)
     Thank you, sir. You mind if I kick in the afterburners, sir?

     O'NEILL
     Oh, please.

     MITCHELL
     Thank you, sir.

   [The F-302 races across the sky.]
