   PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1

   [Flashbacks from 5.15 "Summit".]

   [Ren Au hands a vial to Daniel.]

     REN AU
     These two liquids mixed together form the most virulent poison.

     DANIEL
     Am I supposed to hold my breath?

     REN AU
     The poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

     JACOB
     There's enough material in that vial to kill every Tok'ra on this
     base twice over.

   [Flashback from 7.15 "Chimera.]

   [Osiris beams out of Daniel's bedroom.]

     TEAL'C
     Anubis once probed Thor's mind and in doing so they would have
     gained access to Asgard beaming technology.

   [Flashbacks from 8.08 "Covenant".]

     VOGLER
     Did you really think that they were gonna let you tell a secret like
     this?

     COLSON
     Brian, what are you talking about?

     VOGLER
     They call themselves the Trust.

     CARTER
     They've been funding various secret endeavours, all aimed at
     controlling alien technology for their own purposes.

   [Flashbacks from 8.07 "Affinity".]

   [Daniel has a mystery caller on the phone.]

     CALLER
     The symbols, Doctor Jackson. We know it's the language of the
     Ancients. We need it translated into Goa'uld.

     HOSKINS
     So either you give us what we want...

   [He cocks the weapon and points it at Krista.]

     HOSKINS
     ...or I will kill her.

   [End flashbacks.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX NIGHT

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Harriman is sitting at a monitor, making notes. A technician enters.]

     TECHNICIAN
     What's going on?

     HARRIMAN
     Not much.

   [The technician drags a chair over to sit next to Harriman.]

     TECHNICIAN
     I hate the graveyard shift. Nothing exciting ever happens on it.

     HARRIMAN
     Hey, just because it's 3am here doesn't mean it's not daylight on
     other planets.

   [Harriman leans forward conspiratorially. The tech also leans forward.]

     HARRIMAN
     There could be a team coming in hot, any second now.

     TECHNICIAN

     (awed)
     Yeah, that's true.

   [Both turn slowly to look at the gate.]

     TECHNICIAN
     So, coffee?

     HARRIMAN
     Yeah.

   [They both walk to the rear of the Control Room, backs to the
   Stargate.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Let me ask you something. When it's late at night and there's not
     that many people around do you ever get the urge just to dial up the
     gate and check out another planet, just for a few minutes?

     HARRIMAN
     That would be a no.

     TECHNICIAN
     Me...me...me neither.

   [A bright beam of light illuminates the room.]

     HARRIMAN
     What the hell?

   [Alarms start beeping. Both men look at each other then turn slowly
   towards the gate room. Harriman's mouth drops open in shock. They walk
   to the Control Room window, to see that the Stargate has disappeared. A
   couple of SFs in the gate room look up at them from the base of the
   ramp.]

     TECHNICIAN
     The gate's gone.

     HARRIMAN

     (shocked)
     I...I can see that.

     TECHNICIAN
     Are we gonna get in trouble for this?

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX DAY

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Daniel is interviewing Harriman and the technician. The interview is
   being recorded and filmed.]

     DANIEL
     What about your instruments. Were you detecting any signs of gate
     activity?

     HARRIMAN
     No, sir.

     DANIEL
     Did anyone approach the gate at any time?

     HARRIMAN
     No.

     TECHNICIAN
     No.

     DANIEL
     So no unusual activity of any kind.

   Both men shake their heads, Harriman decisively.

     DANIEL
     Okay.

   [Daniel switches off the tape recorder.]

     TECHNICIAN
     So, are we going to be facing any kind of disciplinary action for
     this?

     DANIEL
     No, Sergeant, I think it's safe to say there was nothing you could
     have done.

     TECHNICIAN
     Thank God! I mean there wasn't. One minute we were getting coffee,
     the next minute....

     DANIEL

     Wait a minute, wait a minute.
     (loudly)
     You were getting coffee?

     TECHNICIAN
     Um...well...it's...

     DANIEL
     I'm joking, I'm joking. It's just a joke. I'm sorry. Okay, that's
     all. Thank you guys, I appreciate that. Okay.

   [Daniel exits, leaving both Harriman and the tech looking relieved.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill and Daniel are looking down into the gateroom. Carter is
   sitting at a monitor on the briefing room table.]

     DANIEL
     I'd hate to be the guy that has to explain this to the President.

   [O'Neill turns to stare at Daniel. Daniel turns to O'Neill, surprised
   to see him glaring.]

     CARTER
     Sir, I've got the video surveillance footage.

   [O'Neill and Daniel turn away from the window and walk across to Carter
   at the table.]

     CARTER
     The gate disappeared at 0307. There were two airmen in the gateroom
     and two technicians in the control room but none of them saw or
     heard anything out of the ordinary prior to the flash.

   [The monitor shows the gate being beamed away.]

     DANIEL
     Is it just me or does that look like an Asgard beam?

     CARTER
     It does, which makes no sense. Why would they take our gate?

     O'NEILL
     Yeah. Usually they ask nicely before they ignore us and do whatever
     they damn well please.

     DANIEL
     What about the Prometheus? Didn't the Asgard install beam technology
     as well as a hyperdrive?

     CARTER
     It's in the hangar. We're still making adjustments to the new
     engines. There is another possibility. We know that Anubis possessed
     Asgard beam technology. We also know that Ba'al took over much of
     his fleet.

     DANIEL
     You think Ba'al stole our gate?

     CARTER
     To be honest, right now I don't know what to think.

     O'NEILL
     Well, I need some answers.

     CARTER
     That's not going to be easy, sir. Without a gate, we have no access
     to offworld intel. We have no way of knowing what's going on out
     there.

     O'NEILL
     You'll think of something. In the meantime...I have a phone call to
     make.

   [O'Neill glares at Daniel again.]

     DANIEL
     Is Teal'c still on P4S-161?

     CARTER
     Yeah, his meeting with the rebel Jaffa leader should be over by now.
     When he can't contact us he'll follow protocol and head to the Alpha
     site.

   [Daniel nods.]

   EXT--ALPHA SITE

   INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM

   [Teal'c enters the Control Room, dressed in robes.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Pierce.

     PIERCE
     Teal'c.

     TEAL'C
     What is the situation?

     PIERCE
     We've been out of contact with Earth for seven hours now. We can
     establish a wormhole but all we get is a do not proceed response to
     our IDC.

     TEAL'C
     As was the case when I attempted to return from my mission.

     PIERCE
     We've had lockdowns before, but the fact that they're not responding
     to any of our radio calls has me concerned. Right now we have no
     idea what's happening at Stargate Command.

     TEAL'C
     I will return to P4S-161. The rebel Jaffa will provide me with a
     cargo ship which I will then take to Earth.

   [Teal'c begins to turn away.]

     PIERCE
     Teal'c.

   [Teal'c turns back to face Pierce.]

     PIERCE
     We're not jumping to conclusions. This may be just a malfunction,
     but it's also possible Earth has been compromised.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c leaves.]

   INT--SGC CARTER'S LAB

   [Daniel enters the lab.]

     DANIEL
     Find anything?

     CARTER
     Yeah, as a matter of fact I have.

   [Daniel walks up to Carter, who is sitting at a monitor.]

     CARTER
     I've been going over gate room security tapes from the sensor logs.
     For two days before the gate disappeared we were getting this
     anomalous reading. We assumed it was residual feedback from a recent
     overhaul of the super conductors, but...I don't think so. Look at
     this.

   [Carter plays a video tape on the monitor, which shows a scientist
   kneeling at the gate. A couple of beeps can be heard on the video.]

     DANIEL
     What was that?

     CARTER
     I don't know. But I checked the time code and this corresponds with
     the exact moment that the sensors began recording the anomaly.

   [Carter zooms in on the image of the scientist at the gate.]

     DANIEL
     I think we need to talk to this guy.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill is looking at a personnel file.]

     CARTER
     Doctor Kevin Hartkins. He's been with the program seven months.
     Clean record, nothing out of the ordinary, except that he's gone
     missing.

     DANIEL
     He failed to report for duty this morning. We checked his apartment,
     it was cleaned out.

     O'NEILL
     This is starting to sound familiar.

     DANIEL
     You think it's the Trust.

     CARTER
     Well, they've been busy lately. They had Teal'c under surveillance,
     they blackmailed you and they tried to kill Alec Colson. Obviously,
     the operation is a lot bigger than we first thought. Now, as far as
     we know the NID has been clean for over a year. But there are still
     dozens of ex-agents who are unaccounted for. And they continue to
     receive financing from unknown sources.

     DANIEL
     Please, if they could take the gate out from under us they could
     empty the vault at Fort Knox.

     CARTER
     Not necessarily. If they could take the gate any time they wanted,
     they would have, but that doesn't explain what Hartkins was doing,
     or the anomalous signal.

     O'NEILL
     Got a theory?

     CARTER
     The Prometheus has Asgard beam technology but not Asgard sensors.
     Which means that we can't pinpoint specific targets unless they've
     been tagged in advance. What if whoever did this has the same
     problem?

     DANIEL
     Do you think the anomaly was a locater beacon?

     CARTER
     Yeah, which Hartkins placed directly on the gate. I mean, there's no
     other way they could pull this off.

     O'NEILL
     So my stamp collection is safe. How does that help us find the gate?

     CARTER
     Well, if they want to keep using the beam, they'll have to keep
     using the beacons. We could request NSA satellite time to see if we
     could detect the signal.

     O'NEILL
     Do it.

   EXT--P4S-161 STARGATE

   [Teal'c exits the Stargate. As he comes down the steps, he prepares his
   staff weapon for firing. Many Jaffa are lying on the ground, dead.
   Teal'c checks the pulse of one then rises, weapon ready, as someone
   comes out of the bushes, also armed.]

     TEAL'C
     M'zel.

   [Teal'c lowers the staff weapon as the other man waves at him.]

     M'ZEL
     Teal'c.

   [M'zel approaches Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     What has happened here?

     M'ZEL
     When I arrived, they were all dead.

     TEAL'C
     All?

     M'ZEL
     I will show you.

   [Both men walk away from the Stargate and the dead Jaffa.]

   EXT--WAREHOUSE

   [A warehouse is surrounded by armed men and two vehicles. Another
   vehicle arrives and three of the armed men go towards it. Carter and
   Daniel exit the vehicle and immediately crouch down behind it. Carter
   speaks to one of the men.]

     SOLDIER
     We took out a couple of guards and we have the area secured.
     Satellite intel puts the signal somewhere inside this complex.

     CARTER
     Alright. You three are with us. Keep your men on the perimeter,
     no-one in, no-one out.

     SOLDIER
     Understood.

   [Carter moves away towards the building's doorway, followed by a couple
   of the soldiers and Daniel. One of the men places an explosive device
   on the door and detonates it. The door opens.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [A smoke grenade is thrown inside. After the grenade detonates, the
   soldiers entered, followed by Carter and Daniel. As Carter checks the
   warehouse, Daniel moves to an area containing equipment.]

     DANIEL
     Sam!

   [Daniel throws back a sheet covering a number of rockets.]

     CARTER
     Daniel, these are VX rockets.

   [Daniel picks up a cylinder, containing a fluorescent blue liquid.]

     DANIEL
     Yeah? What's this?

     CARTER
     Methyl Phosphonofluoridic acid.

     DANIEL
     Which is?

     CARTER
     Nerve gas.

     DANIEL
     Okay, putting that back.

   [Daniel places the cylinder back on the table.]

     CARTER
     There's enough here to kill several hundred thousand people.

     DANIEL
     What would the ex-NID be doing stockpiling this stuff?

     CARTER
     I've no idea.

     SOLDIER
     Gun!

   [The soldiers start firing at a man who appears from behind a truck. He
   returns fire, hitting the nerve gas canisters. Carter zats him. As the
   soldiers move towards the man, Daniel notices that the damaged
   canisters are smoking.]

     DANIEL
     Ah! We've got a problem here. What do we do?

   [Carter turns to see the canisters.]

     CARTER
     It's too late.

     DANIEL
     Nothing's happening.

     CARTER
     This doesn't make sense. The effects are almost instantaneous. We
     should all be dead.

   EXT--P4S-161

   [Teal'c and M'zel come upon the main camp.]

     M'ZEL
     You see?

   [The ground is littered with bodies. Teal'c is visibly shaken and
   upset.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [O'Neill is studying photographs of the canisters, rockets etc.]

     CARTER
     We managed to identify the liquid we found in the warehouse.

   [Carter hands a small vial of blue liquid to O'Neill.]

     CARTER
     It's symbiote poison. Specifically, the new formula we were working
     on in conjunction with the Tok'ra. [O'Neill carefully places the
     vial on the table and wipes his fingers.]

     CARTER
     It's more stable than the original and easier to produce but just as
     deadly to the Goa'uld.

     DANIEL
     And the Jaffa.

     CARTER
     Exactly, which is why we agreed not to use it, except in defensive
     situations. Sir, the people behind this have the gate and they have
     rockets capable of delivering the poison in aerosol form over large
     areas. I think The Trust intends to launch a full scale chemical
     attack against the Goa'uld, without any regard for the millions of
     Jaffa lives that could be lost in the process.

     O'NEILL
     So, they didn't get the memo.

     DANIEL
     The guy from the warehouse isn't talking but he was carrying this.

   [Daniel hands a badge to O'Neill, who studies it.]

     DANIEL
     It's an Area 51 identification badge.

   EXT--AREA 51 COMPLEX

   INT--AREA 51 OFFICES

   [A scientist enters a room where Daniel and Carter are waiting. A guard
   is standing outside the room.]

     BRICKSDALE
     Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson. Sorry to keep you waiting.

   [Carter and Daniel stand. They are both wearing khaki jumpsuits.]

     CARTER
     Doctor Bricksdale, I believe you've been briefed on our situation.

     BRICKSDALE
     Yes, I have

     CARTER
     Well, as a result of our investigation we have reason to believe
     that your security has been compromised.

     BRICKSDALE
     With all due respect, Colonel, we're not the ones who lost a
     Stargate.

     DANIEL
     But alien technology has gone missing from Area 51 before.

     BRICKSDALE
     Yes, however our security measures have been significantly increased
     since then. No-one's allowed to bring anything in or out. No
     computers, no cell phones, not even their street clothes, as you've
     seen. All personnel are subject to a thorough search and scan every
     time they leave.

     CARTER
     Look, whoever took the Stargate has access to Asgard beam
     technology. Last year, when Osiris came to Earth she used that same
     technology which she activated remotely with a wrist device. After
     she was captured that wrist device was brought here, and you worked
     on it.

     BRICKSDALE
     And it's been here ever since.

     DANIEL
     Well, if you don't mind, we'd like to see it.

   EXT--ALPHA SITE

   INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM

     PIERCE
     Doctor Harris checked out some of the dead Jaffa on P4S-161. You
     were right. It was the Tok'ra symbiote poison.

     TEAL'C
     I would not have believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes.

     PIERCE
     I knew the Tok'ra had lost patience with the alliance but I never
     thought they'd do anything like this.

   [M'zel enters.]

     M'ZEL

     (angrily)
     Teal'c! I have received word from our Jaffa brothers. Three more
     Goa'uld planets have been attacked. Millions are dead.

   [Teal'c looks stunned.]

   INT--AREA 51 SECURED STORAGE ROOM

   [Bricksdale, Carter and Daniel enter a room, having shown their passes
   to a couple of guards. Bricksdale places his hand on a palm reader and
   a drawer opens. Inside is a wrist device.]

     BRICKSDALE
     You see? It's right where we left it.

     CARTER
     Sorry if I'm a little skeptical but we've been down this road
     before.

   [Carter scans the device.]

     CARTER
     It's real

     BRICKSDALE
     Like I said. We figured if Osiris' ship was still up there, we could
     use the wrist device to get onboard. Unfortunately, it's not only
     keyed to the presence of naquadah in the blood of the user, but also
     specific Goa'uld DNA. We tried to create an adaptor using samples of
     both elements, but we didn't get anywhere.

     DANIEL
     So the ship is probably still in orbit but cloaked.

     CARTER
     In which case, we have no way to find it.

   INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM

     M'ZEL

     (angrily)
     The Tok'ra will be made to pay for this treachery.

     PIERCE
     Let's just calm down a second. We need to figure out what's going
     on.

     M'ZEL
     What more do you need to know? The Jaffa are being murdered,
     poisoned like vermin.

     PIERCE
     The Tok'ra have had this chemical weapon for a long time. Why would
     they suddenly decide to use it now?

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps the failure of the alliance convinced them that there was no
     other way.

     PIERCE
     There's something else going on. It's not a coincidence that this
     happened immediately after we lost contact with Earth.

     TEAL'C
     It does seem unlikely. We must speak to the Tok'ra directly.

     PIERCE
     That's not so easy. Ever since they left the Alpha Site we haven't
     had much intelligence on their movements. We have no idea where the
     new base is.

     TEAL'C
     We still know the location of some of their operatives. I believe
     our best chance for contact is P3S-114. A Tok'ra operative named
     Zarin is undercover, commanding one of Ba'al's garrisons on that
     world.

     M'ZEL
     I will come with you.

     PIERCE
     Whoa, hold on a minute, here. You're talking about walking into
     Goa'uld occupied territory. There's no Jaffa fifth column there to
     help you out. Without sympathetic warriors in Zarin's ranks, how do
     you plan to avoid being captured?

     TEAL'C
     We do not.

     PIERCE
     What?

     M'ZEL
     Only by being captured will we be brought before the commander.

     PIERCE
     That's how you're going to make contact?

     M'ZEL
     We must speak to the Tok'ra. There is no other way.

     PIERCE
     It's too risky. You walk in there unannounced and Zarin could have
     you sacrificed just to maintain her cover.

     TEAL'C
     That is a great possibility.

     PIERCE
     You realise, the second you walk through that gate you're on your
     own.

     TEAL'C
     Understood.

   [Teal'c and M'zel leave.]

   EXT--EARTH WAREHOUSE AREA

   [Bricksdale is standing, nervously waiting. As he begins to make a
   phone call, a car arrives. He closes his phone. Hoskins gets out of the
   car.]

     HOSKINS
     So what's the big emergency?

     BRICKSDALE
     I can't do this anymore.

     HOSKINS
     You've already taken the money, Doctor. A little late for cold feet.

     BRICKSDALE
     You don't understand. They came to see me. They asked me about the
     wrist device.

     HOSKINS
     Who?

     BRICKSDALE
     Two people from Stargate Command.

     HOSKINS
     And you arranged a meeting with me?

   [Hoskins looks around, nervously.]

     BRICKSDALE
     What?

   [A black van races into the alley towards them.]

     HOSKINS
     You were followed.

   [Hoskins fires as a number of armed men exit the van. As the men return
   fire, Hoskins shoots out the lock on a wooden door near him and goes
   inside. Another van races up, just as the SG forces surround
   Bricksdale, who puts his hands high in the air. As Bricksdale is pushed
   down onto the car's bonnet, another team follow Hoskins into the
   building. Hoskins fires on the soldiers, who duck behind crates.]

     SOLDIER
     Nobody fire, we need him alive.

   [Hoskins climbs out onto the roof, then runs along until he jumps down
   to the ground. As he activates a device, Carter stands from behind a
   vehicle and zats him. Carter moves towards Hoskins and picks up the
   device which is beeping softly. Suddenly, she is beamed away.]

     We've got a small problem here. Take a locator beacon and get down
     to Hoskins' last position.

     BROOKES

     (over radio)
     What happened?

     JENNINGS

     (into radio)
     We've got an uninvited guest.

   rockets, one of which is aimed at the Stargate.]

   EXT--P3S-114

   INT--P3S-114 THRONE ROOM

   [Zarin is sitting on the throne. Three Jaffa enter and kneel in front
   of her.]

     ZARIN
     Speak.

     JAFFA
     My Lord Zarin. Two enemy Jaffa have been captured near the gate. One
     of them is the Shol'va, Teal'c.

     ZARIN
     Are you certain?

     JAFFA
     I am. Lord Ba'al will be most pleased, will he not?

     ZARIN
     Yes. Of course. You have done well. Now bring them to me.

     JAFFA
     Yes, my Lord.

   [The three rise and leave.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Daniel is interviewing Bricksdale. There are a couple of SF guards in
   the room.]

     DANIEL
     I'm going to ask you again. Where's Colonel Carter?

     BRICKSDALE

     (frustrated)
     I don't know!

   [Daniel gestures the guards to leave the room and locks the door behind
   them. He sits opposite Bricksdale.]

     DANIEL
     You're gonna need to start co-operating.

     BRICKSDALE
     I can't!

     DANIEL
     A decorated officer in the United States Air Force and a member of
     one of our government's most top secret organisations is missing,
     and you're implicated.

   [Bricksdale looks down, a hand to his forehead.]

     DANIEL
     I don't think you're gonna just walk away from this.

     BRICKSDALE
     They'll kill me.

     DANIEL
     We can protect you.

   [Bricksdale shakes his head, scared.]

     DANIEL
     And we can also choose to ignore your two million dollar Cayman
     Island account.

   [Bricksdale looks up at Daniel, shocked.]

     DANIEL
     Didn't think we'd find out about that, huh?

     BRICKSDALE
     So if I help you, I can keep the money?

     DANIEL
     We could come to an arrangement.

   [Bricksdale sits back, happier.]

   INT--P3S-114 THRONE ROOM

   [Teal'c and M'zel are brought to Zarin by three Jaffa. They are pushed
   to their knees.]

     JAFFA
     The prisoners, my Lord.

     ZARIN
     Leave us.

   [The main Jaffa appears surprised.]

     JAFFA
     My Lord?

   [Zarin rises from the throne.]

     ZARIN
     I intend to question them myself. Leave us, now!

   [The three Jaffa and other guards in the room leave.]

     ZARIN
     Are you mad? What are you doing here?

   [Teal'c and M'zel stand.]

     TEAL'C
     We must speak with you.

     ZARIN
     Speak with me? Do you not realise that by coming here you have
     placed all our lives in danger?

     TEAL'C
     Are you not in control of this garrison?

     ZARIN
     I am. And as such, it is my responsibility to see to it that you are
     tortured for information. Until such time that Ba'al arrives to
     witness your execution.

   [Teal'c and M'zel look at each, eyebrows raised.]

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

     DANIEL
     So, what's it gonna be?

     BRICKSDALE
     You said Colonel Carter was missing?

   [Daniel nods.]

     BRICKSDALE
     Well, she's probably on the ship.

     DANIEL
     Osiris' ship. So you did manage to get on board?

   [Bricksdale nods.]

     BRICKSDALE
     About a year ago some men came to see me. They knew everything about
     my work, the Stargate, Osiris. They knew there was a possibility
     that a cloaked ship had been left in orbit and they wanted it badly.
     I told them that the key was the wrist device, but I couldn't get it
     out of there, at least not through the front door.

     DANIEL
     What do you mean?

     BRICKSDALE
     One day I was in the lab working on the adapter. The next thing I
     know, I found myself on the ship. I had remotely activated the
     transport beam.

     DANIEL
     Which you failed to report.

     BRICKSDALE
     It was killing me that I wasn't able to tell anybody I'd figured it
     out. I had to keep telling them it wasn't working. Anyway, after
     that, I went back and forth half a dozen times. But at the end of
     the day, the wrist device was always back where it belonged.

     DANIEL
     And you beamed the others up using locator beacons.

     BRICKSDALE
     Well, the beam was the only thing that worked without the command
     codes. That's where you came in.

     DANIEL
     Translation.

   [Daniel closes his eyes in disgust.]

     BRICKSDALE
     Osiris worked for Anubis, and Anubis had all his command codes
     translated into Ancient. And once they had full control of the ship,
     thanks to you, they had no need for me. They kept a permanent
     presence up there, twenty four-seven, worked in shifts. I went back
     to Area 51 and sabotaged the adapter. Project was shelved and no-one
     was the wiser.

     DANIEL
     Can you get the wrist device to work again?

     BRICKSDALE
     Absolutely.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP CARGO HOLD

   [Carter, lying on weapon containers, regains consciousness. She sits
   up, arms tied behind her back. Brookes walks over to Hoskins.]

     BROOKES
     Launch window in three minutes. Ready for upgrade.

     HOSKINS
     Get down to the engine room. Check the power relays.

     BROOKES
     Yes, sir.

   [Jennings notices that Carter is conscious.]

     JENNINGS
     Sir.

   [He gestures at Carter. Hoskins turns towards her.]

     HOSKINS
     Colonel Carter. Welcome aboard.

     CARTER
     Where are we?

     HOSKINS
     We're in a polar orbit around the moon. Cloaked, of course.

     CARTER
     This is the ship Osiris left behind.

     HOSKINS
     We really have to thank you. If you hadn't have caught her we never
     would have had this opportunity.

     CARTER
     You know they're gonna come after you.

     JENNINGS
     Prometheus is undergoing a refit.

     CARTER
     They still have sub-light engines. Once they've realised you're in a
     ship they'll launch. And even with a cloak you're giving off an
     energy signature.

     HOSKINS
     We're operating at minimal power. Maybe after a year of intensive
     scans they might be able to find us. But this won't take that long.

   [Jennings loads a cylinder of the symbiote poison into a rocket.]

     CARTER
     You're gonna launch a chemical attack against the Goa'uld.

     JENNINGS
     We already have. We're starting with Ba'al's territory, Since he's
     the most immediate threat right now.

     CARTER
     You realise you're killing millions of innocent Jaffa.

     HOSKINS
     Spare me, Colonel. The Jaffa are a race of warriors, bred
     specifically to serve the Goa'uld and enslave humans throughout the
     galaxy.

     CARTER
     They're indoctrinated from childhood to believe that the Goa'uld are
     their Gods. They don't have a choice.

     JENNINGS
     So they're just following orders, right? Where have I heard that
     argument before?

     CARTER
     What about the rebel Jaffa? They're growing in numbers every day.

     JENNINGS
     We consider them acceptable losses.

     HOSKINS
     It's very simple, Colonel. Earth faces an imminent threat and we
     have a weapon that can eliminate that threat. We intend to use it.

   [The rocket is armed.]

     JENNINGS
     We're ready.

   [Jennings walks over to a computer.]

     HOSKINS
     What's the next target?

     JENNINGS
     P3S-114.

     HOSKINS
     Dial it.

     JENNINGS
     Yes, sir.

   [The dialling sequence begins on the Stargate.]

   INT--P3S-114 THRONE ROOM

     ZARIN
     You force me to choose between abandoning my mission, and allowing
     you to die.

     M'ZEL
     I would worry more about my own life if I were you, Tok'ra.

   [M'zel walks up to Zarin and places his hands around her throat.]

     TEAL'C
     M'zel! I feel as you do, brother. But this is not the way.

   [M'zel continues to choke Zarin, but turns to look at Teal'c. He lets
   Zarin go and steps back.]

     ZARIN
     Why are you here?

     M'ZEL
     We know about the attacks.

     ZARIN
     What attacks?

     TEAL'C
     The Tok'ra have been using symbiote poison against the Goa'uld.
     Jaffa of three worlds have been annihilated thus far.

     ZARIN
     Impossible.

     M'ZEL
     We have seen it with our own eyes. An entire Jaffa army lying dead
     on the ground with no wounds, no signs of battle. How do you explain
     this?

     ZARIN
     I cannot. But I can assure you that the Tok'ra are not responsible.
     If these attacks had been planned I would have been informed.

   [Teal'c and M'zel look at Zarin, considering her words.]

     JENNINGS
     Initiating launch sequence.

     CARTER
     You can't do this. It's murder.

     JENNINGS
     That's where you're wrong, Colonel. It's war.

     JENNINGS
     Launching in three...two...one.

   [The rocket is shot through the gate. Carter closes her eyes in
   despair.]

   EXT--P3S-114

   [A number of Jaffa are walking through a grassed area. They see the
   rocket flying through the air.]

   INT--P3S-114 THRONE ROOM

   [The sound of the rocket hitting is heard.]

     ZARIN
     What was that?

   [A number of Jaffa enter. Teal'c and M'zel fall to their knees as they
   hear them coming.]

     JAFFA
     My Lord, we are under attack.

     ZARIN
     How?

     JAFFA
     A weapon was fired through the gate. It exploded over the sea.

   [Zarin suddenly jerks in pain and grabs the back of her neck. She is
   having difficulty breathing. The main Jaffa runs up to her.]

     JAFFA
     Lord Zarin!

   [The Jaffa holds Zarin as she falls to the ground.]

     JAFFA
     Lord Zarin!

   [Zarin dies.]

     TEAL'C
     Brothers, we must leave immediately.

     JAFFA
     Kree! An'oc.

   [The Jaffa guard prime their weapons and aim them at Teal'c and M'zel.
   The lead Jaffa aims a zat at them.]

     JAFFA
     You are not going anywhere Shol'va!

     TEAL'C
     You do not understand.

   [M'zel doubles over in pain, followed by the other Jaffa. The sound of
   a symbiote screeching can be heard.]

     TEAL'C
     M'zel, there may still be time.

   [Teal'c holds M'zel as he falls to the ground. All the Jaffa have
   collapsed.]

     M'ZEL
     I die free!

   [Teal'c gently places M'zel's head on the ground as he dies.]

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     Yes, sir.

     PENDERGAST
     She's out there somewhere.

   INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Daniel enters the room. Bricksdale is sitting at the table. Daniel
   slams a case onto the table. Opening it, he swivels the case round to
   show Bricksdale the wrist device.]

     DANIEL
     Make it work.

   [Bricksdale smirks at Daniel.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP CARGO HOLD

     JENNINGS
     Our next target is P5R-357.

     HOSKINS
     Let's do it.

     CARTER
     I wouldn't bother.

   [Both men turn to face Carter.]

     CARTER
     Ba'al abandoned that planet six months ago when the naquadah mines
     went dry.

     JENNINGS
     She's lying.

     CARTER
     Go ahead. Waste another rocket, that's one less planet you'll be
     able to destroy.

     HOSKINS
     She does have more up-to-date intelligence.

     JENNINGS
     She's bluffing.

     HOSKINS
     You can make this a lot less painful if you help us select optimum
     targets.

     CARTER
     What are you talking about?

     HOSKINS
     You know as much about the current tactical and strategic positions
     of the different System Lords as anyone on Earth.

     CARTER
     I don't know as much as you think.

     HOSKINS
     You know enough to help us get maximum effect with minimum
     collateral damage. You're the one who wants to save innocent lives.

   [Carter smiles mirthlessly.]

     CARTER
     Nice try.

     JENNINGS
     So. Are we going for P5R-357, or not?

   [Hoskins ponders, looking at Carter.]

     HOSKINS
     Go to the next one on the list.

   [Jennings shakes his head, obviously not happy.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [As Daniel gears up, Siler works on the wrist device. O'Neill enters.]

     O'NEILL
     Alright, tell me again why I should agree to this?

     DANIEL
     Because it's the only way we have to get on the ship, and if they've
     changed the command codes I'm the one who has the best chance to
     decipher the Ancient symbols.

     O'NEILL
     And if there are ten armed goons when you get there you're the one
     that's gonna get...

   [O'Neill gestures a finger across his throat.]

     DANIEL
     Better ideas?

   [Daniel looks at O'Neill and Siler. Both are silent.]

     O'NEILL
     Look, Daniel, just because I don't have a better idea is no reason
     to do anything.

   [Both Daniel and O'Neill look confused.]

     DANIEL
     Look, once I shut down the cloak, Prometheus will be able to
     pinpoint the ship's location. Then all I'll have to do is disable
     the hyper-drive and wait for the cavalry. They'll never see it
     coming.

     O'NEILL
     Which is one of the advantages of a totally insane idea.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, where did I learn that from?

   [Daniel and O'Neill grimace at each other.]

     DANIEL
     Okay.

   [Siler hands the wrist device to Daniel. As Daniel activates a zat,
   Siler moves to stand behind O'Neill. Seeing this, O'Neill moves back
   also. Daniel turns to look at a scientist standing behind him. The man
   moves away quickly.]

     DANIEL
     See you soon.

   [Daniel activates the wrist device and is beamed out.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP BRIDGE

   [Daniel materialises on the ship. Seeing that the room is empty, he
   moves to a console and tries to access the system. Access is denied.]

     DANIEL
     Come on!

   [Typing further, he gets a System Error message.]

     DANIEL
     Fine!

   [Moving away from the console, he opens a drawer containing power
   crystals. He fires the zat at the crystals, which die.]

     We've got a problem. I just monitored a sixty percent drop in our
     power consumption.

   Brookes.]

     HOSKINS
     Stay with her.

   [Jennings turns to look down at Carter.]

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Daniel stealthily moves down the corridor, zat at the ready. As he
   turns a corner he is zatted from behind. Hoskins and Brookes come
   around the corner, zat aimed at Daniel.]

     HOSKINS
     Get up to the bridge. Get that cloak back online.

     BROOKES
     Yes, sir.

     COMM OFFICER
     We're in weapons range, sir.

     COMM OFFICER
     I don't think so. They seem to be operating at minimal power, no
     evasive manoeuvres.

     What about the hyper-drive.

     COMM OFFICER
     Still no signal from Doctor Jackson.

     PENDERGAST

     Right now, sir, they are sitting ducks. If they spot us they can run
     and we won't be able to catch them. We can't afford to let them get
     away, General. I recommend we open fire immediately.

   INT--OSIRIS' SHIP CARGO HOLD

   [Daniel sits down next to Carter. They both look at each other, smiling
   slightly. Hoskins stands over them, holding a zat. Jennings enters,
   wiping his hands on a rag.]

     JENNINGS
     Where the hell did he come from?

   [He throws the rag down in anger.]

     HOSKINS
     He had the wrist device.

     JENNINGS
     Any chance there's more of them onboard?

     HOSKINS
     It only lets one person up at a time.

     Hoskins, this is Brookes.

     HOSKINS

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     BROOKES

     The cloak's been disabled. I don't know if I can get it back online.

     This position is compromised. We need to get out of here now.

     BROOKES

     (over radio)
     Yes, sir.

     JENNINGS
     What about them?

     HOSKINS
     We can't take them with us.

     I don't mind going for a little ride.

     CARTER
     Me neither.

   [Hoskins aims the zat at them.]

     HOSKINS
     Sorry about this, Doctor Jackson.

   [The gate suddenly activates. Jennings and Hoskins turn towards it.]

     JENNINGS
     Incoming!

   [Jennings and Hoskins dive to the floor as the event horizon whooshes
   out. As Hoskins starts to rise, Daniel jumps up and pushes him to the
   floor. Carter kicks Jennings' feet from under him. Hoskins' zat and
   radio skitter across the floor.]

     (over radio - via Stargate)
     This is Teal'c of SG-1. Please respond.

   in the stomach and face.]

     This is Teal'c of SG-1. Repeat, this is Teal'c.

   Hoskins' radio.]

     Does anyone read? Repeat, this is Teal'c.

     DANIEL

     (into radio)
     Teal'c, this is Daniel, we need your help, come on through.

   [Hoskins notices the zat and rushes to pick it up. As he aims it at
   Daniel, Teal'c comes through the Stargate. Hoskins, hearing Teal'c come
   through, turns to fire at him but Teal'c shoots him with his staff
   weapon. Hoskins falls to the ground, dead. Teal'c walks down the steps
   to Hoskins, still aiming at him.]

     Well, they left most of it behind, but they still have enough to
