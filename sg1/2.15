   EXT--OUTER SPACE--PLANET DESIGNATION P3W-451

   [Planetary sunrise as seen from space. Pan to the right and see a
   yellow star, similar to Earth's sun. As pan to the right continues, we
   see that this star system is a binary, with the yellow star orbiting a
   white dwarf companion. Around the white dwarf flows a continual stream
   of matter leeched from the yellow star. A few minutes later, the white
   dwarf collapses and becomes a black hole, which begins to pull space
   debris and other matter into its gravity well. Its orbit takes it
   extremely close to P3W-451. Fade from space view of P3W-451 to its
   surface.]

   EXT--PLANET P3W-451

   [A figure dressed in BDU's is running through sandy ground toward an
   unrevealed destination. The reason he's running is also unrevealed. As
   the camera pans up from this single person, we see that he's
   accompanied by two men and a woman -- a Stargate team. The figure in
   the lead looks back over his shoulder at his companions. We can see the
   patches of the SGC/Earth symbol on their shoulders. All the voices are
   distorted because of their closeness to the black hole.]

     BOYD
     Come on!

   [All four of them continue running toward their destination. One man
   loses his footing in the sand and stumbles, falling face first. His
   team leader stops to help him up, grabbing him by the collar. The
   captain reaches the summit of the hill first and starts down it, with
   his teammates following him.]

     CAPTAIN
     It's right on top of us!

     BOYD
     Dial home, Captain! That's an order!

   [All four of them are panting and heaving as they struggle to get up a
   hill to an unseen object. As the others reach the summit and go down a
   small incline to reach the object, the female stumbles. Major Boyd
   helps her up and over the hill ahead of him. The Dial Home Device is in
   view. The captain reaches it first.]

     CAPTAIN
     We're not going to make it, sir!

     BOYD
     We'll make it! Dial now!

   [He rolls up his sleeve, revealing a GDO. He looks back at something
   that's obviously scared the four of them, back to his team and then
   back to whatever they're running from.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY

   [Fade to exterior scene of Cheyenne Mountain, two guards dressed in
   cammos are walking in front of the entrance to the mountain and a
   humvee is parked nearby.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill and Carter standing in front of a map in the control room.]

     O'NEILL

     (whispering)
     Look, I know I should know this by now. I swear it'll be the last
     time I ask. These wormholes we go through, they're not always there,
     right?

     CARTER

     (keeping her voice low, too)
     No, sir. It can only form between two open gates.

     O'NEILL
     What's with the worm part? The worm thing. I-I don't get that.

     CARTER
     That's just a metaphor.

     O'NEILL
     Right. I knew that.

   [Carter puts the pad she's holding down on the desk and turns back to
   face O'Neill as she begins to gesture.]

     CARTER
     Imagine the galaxy is an apple. We burrow our way through the apple
     like a worm, crossing from one side to the other instead of going
     around the outside.

     O'NEILL

     (Thinks then nods)
     Okay.

     CARTER
     Now, of course, the diameter of the apple is just a two-dimensional
     representation of space-time and well, the hole isn't a hole per se,
     but an interdimensional conduit...

   [Looking at O'Neill, she sees the blank look on the colonel's face.]

     CARTER
     Colonel?

   [His eyes are closed as he digests the information.]

     O'NEILL
     Okay.

   [He closes his eyes and shakes his head.]

     O'NEILL
     I'll be all right.

     CARTER

     (Smiling, amusedly)
     Okay.

   [The klaxons sound as the Stargate's inner bevel begins turning,
   signaling an incoming traveler. Lieutenant Simmons Simmons gets up from
   a nearby desk where he's working and heads toward the control room.]

     SIMMONS

     (To Carter and O'Neill)
     We've got an unscheduled incoming traveler.

   [Carter and O'Neill follow him.]

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN

     (over P.A. System)
     Closing the iris.

   [Simmons sits down in front of the main dialing computer and looks at
   the monitor. O'Neill and Carter stand behind him.]

     SIMMONS
     Getting a signal.

     O'NEILL
     Who've we got out there?

     SIMMONS
     SG teams 4, 6 and 10 are the only units presently off world, sir.

   [Simmons turns and looks at O'Neill over his shoulder, then turns his
   attention back to the screen in front of him.]

     O'NEILL
     Daniel's with 6, isn't he?

     CARTER
     Yeah, he's on a dig on P3X-808.

     SIMMONS
     Computer can't identify the signal. It's not a GDO transmission.

   [Simmons turns and looks at Carter and they both turn their attention
   back to the screen.]

     CARTER
     Let me hear it.

   [She listens closely to the signal.]

     CARTER
     Intermittent RF pulses, low frequency.

   [The camera centers on the computer screen in front of them and Simmons
   reaches up to activate the external computer speakers so they can hear
   the signal. General Hammond enters the control room.]

     HAMMOND
     What have we got?

     O'NEILL
     Don't know, sir. Some kind of signal.

     CARTER
     There's a repeating signal. Lieutenant, play it through the
     computer. We can run it a lot faster.

     SIMMONS
     Trying 200 percent.

   [The lieutenant types the command into the computer.]

     CARTER
     Go 6.

   [Simmons types her order into the computer and it becomes a signal it
   recognizes as Simmons and Carter look at the monitor.]

     SIMMONS
     Computer now recognizes the signal as SG-10's iris code.

     O'NEILL
     That's Henry Boyd's team.

   [Simmons turns to look at Carter. The shot then turns to Hammond.]

     HAMMOND
     Why would their code be coming through so slowly?

     CARTER
     I have no idea, sir, but if we don't open the iris--

     O'NEILL
     The next thud we hear will be Henry Boyd's team.

   [Simmons's looking at Hammond as the general and O'Neill talk.]

     HAMMOND
     Do it.

   [The lieutenant turns back to the computer and types in the command.
   The iris slowly opens.]

     O'NEILL
     Come on, Hank. The door's open.

   [O'Neill anxiously waits, then the wormhole abruptly collapses.]

     HAMMOND
     What happened?

     CARTER
     I don't know, sir.

     O'NEILL
     General, SG-1 would like the rescue mission.

     HAMMOND
     Not yet, Colonel.

     O'NEILL
     Hank would do the same for us.

     HAMMOND
     I know he would, if and when I gave the order.

   [Hammond looks at Simmons.]

     HAMMOND
     In the meantime, I want a probe on the ramp and ready to go ASAP.

   [Simmons gets up from the chair and leaves the control room to see to
   the preparations of the probe.]

     HAMMOND
     Colonel, have units SG-1 and 3 geared up and standing by.

   [O'Neill and Carter leave the control room to see to prepping the two
   rescue teams. Hammond turns to look at the Stargate, then turns to
   leave the control room.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [A MALP is being prepped by SGC technicians as Hammond, Carter, O'Neill
   and Teal'c are seen through the opened doorway headed toward the Gate
   room.]

     HAMMOND
     SG-10 was on a routine exploratory mission of P3W-451.

     CARTER
     It's a binary system. We just recently discovered it.

     TEAL'C
     Were there any indications of an enemy attack?

   [Hammond walks through the Gate room and through the opposite door.]

     HAMMOND
     None. One thing Major Boyd's team reported was that whatever
     indigenous life there may have been on 451 recently became extinct.
     They were trying to determine the cause. In the event, I authorize
     this mission, SG-3 will back you up.

   [Hammond turns the corner and heads up the steps to the Control Center
   followed by the team.]

     O'NEILL
     In the event, sir?

     SIMMONS

     (At the Command Console)
     Chevron 3 encoded.

     HAMMOND
     Let's see what the pictures the probe sends back. Make the proper
     threat determination.

     O'NEILL
     General--

     HAMMOND
     You could Gate into an ambush for all we know.

     O'NEILL
     I recommended Major Boyd for this command. Now, if he's in trouble,
     I want to go in.

     HAMMOND
     I'm aware of that, Colonel.

     SIMMONS
     Chevron 4 encoded.

     O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

     SIMMONS
     Chevron 5 encoded.

     TEAL'C
     Major Boyd is a capable warrior, O'Neill. You trained him well.

     O'NEILL

     (worriedly)
     Yeah.

     SIMMONS
     Chevron 6 encoded.

   [He continues to watch the dialing computer's monitor, and from the
   Gate room, Carter is seen looking over the MALP momentarily before
   heading up to the Control Room.]

     SIMMONS
     Chevron 7 locked.

   [The Stargate opens.]

     FEMALE TECHNICIAN

     (from inside the Gate room)
     Okay for MALP transport, sir.

   [The MALP heads up the ramp and goes through the wormhole and an SG
   team stands at the base of the ramp awaiting orders while the three
   members of SG-1 look on. On the other side, it begins transmitting
   imagesofwhatitseesbacktotheSGC.Blurryimagesinred appear on the
   monitor.]

     HAMMOND
     I don't understand. It's just--

     O'NEILL
     Red, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Are we receiving telemetry?

     SIMMONS
     Yes, sir, but at an even slower rate than before.

     CARTER
     There's an image here. Input the video feed into the computer, but
     compensate for a longer light wavelength. Step it up in 20
     millimicron increments.

     HAMMOND
     Captain?

     CARTER
     Sir, it's possible that the image we're receiving from the probe has
     red-shifted, distorted toward the infrared end of the spectrum.

     HAMMOND
     Why?

     TEAL'C
     The same reason their codes came through so slowly.

     CARTER
     Yeah, whatever that is.

     SIMMONS
     It's working.

   [They are looking upon what appears to be a frozen image of Major Boyd
   on screen.]

     O'NEILL

     (To no one in particular)
     What the hell's going on, Hank?

     TEAL'C
     Is something pursuing them?

     HAMMOND
     See if you can play back the video transmission in real time. We
     need to find out--

     SIMMONS
     This is all we've received so far, sir. 11 frames of digital picture
     in the last 6 minutes.

     CARTER
     That represents a fraction of a second.

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps a malfunction?

     O'NEILL
     No. The picture tells us everything we need to know. That team is in
     trouble, probably under attack. Permission to go in, sir?

     CARTER
     Negative, sir.

     O'NEILL
     What do you mean, 'negative?'

     CARTER
     I'm sorry, Colonel. With all due respect, but if I'm right, we can't
     help them. Now the camera may still respond to commands.

     CARTER

     (to Simmons)
     See if you can tilt it up and give us a wider image.

   [Simmons types the command into the computer.]

     CARTER
     I think I know what Major Boyd seems so afraid of.

   [The MALP camera tilts up and we see a blurry patch of sky that Carter
   points at.]

     CARTER
     There. Isolate that area and digitally enhance.

   [The image focuses into that of a black hole as seen from the
   perspective of the MALP and SG-10. Everyone turns to look at Carter.]

     HAMMOND

     (Anxious)
     What am I looking at?

     O'NEILL

     (Awed)
     That's a black hole, sir.

     CARTER
     A newly formed one by the looks of it. P3W-451 was orbiting its
     companion star. The orbit's probably pulling them closer and closer.

     HAMMOND

     (confused)
     Why don't they just Gate out of there?

     CARTER
     They're trying to, sir, but the closer you get to a black hole--

     O'NEILL
     Time slows down.

     TEAL'C
     It almost appears to stand still.

     CARTER
     From our perspective, yes, but you have to remember that time is
     relative. As far as SG-10 is concerned, only a few seconds have
     passed. They're still trying to save themselves.

     HAMMOND
     What will happen to them?

     CARTER
     Well, sir, the time dilation is a result to the intense gravity,
     which is directly proportional to their proximity--

     HAMMOND

     (annoyed)
     Captain!

     CARTER

     (Pausing)
     Sorry, sir. Their bodies will be pulled apart by increasing tidal
     forces.

     TEAL'C
     They did manage to activate the Stargate once.

     CARTER
     Yeah, but from their perspective, it couldn't have been open for
     more than a second.

     HAMMOND
     Is there nothing we can do to save them?

     O'NEILL
     They've had it, sir.

     HAMMOND
     You know that for a fact, Colonel?

     O'NEILL
     No, sir. I don't, but have a look at Major Boyd's face. What does
     that say to you?

   [Boyd's face appears to be one indicating desperation. Hammond looks at
   it solemnly.]

     HAMMOND
     Very well.

   [He turns to look at Simmons.]

     HAMMOND
     Disengage the Stargate.

     CARTER
     Sir. By some fluke of Stargate technology, we are witnessing
     something that the laws of physics say we can't possibly witness.

     O'NEILL

     (pissed)
     We are witnessing good men die in slow motion, Captain.

     CARTER

     (realization, then quietly)
     You're right, sir.

     HAMMOND
     Shut it down.

   [Simmons inputs the order, but the computer flashes the following
   message: "Shutdown Sequence Incomplete. Cannot Disengage." Simmons
   looks at the screen and tries again, twice. He turns to Hammond.]

     SIMMONS
     Sir, it won't disengage.

     HAMMOND
     Try again.

     SIMMONS
     I already have, sir. Twice. It won't shut down.

   [O'Neill stares at the Stargate, uncertain as to what's going on. Then
   back to the monitor image of the black hole.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY

   [A team of United States Air Force Special Forces operatives pile out
   of the back of a Humvee parked just outside the mountain.]

     SOLDIER
     Go! Go! Move! Move!

   [They take positions outside the entrance and appear to be securing the
   mountain from anyone exiting. Another Humvee rolls in and stops and
   three officers step out of the vehicle. The apparent commander heads
   toward one of the soldiers.]

     CROMWELL
     Sergeant, how long have you been out of contact with this facility?

     SERGEANT
     Coming on four hours ago, sir. But it was 'funky' for a while before
     that.

     CROMWELL

     (Gruff, typical drill sergeant-like)
     Is that proper military terminology? What exactly does 'funky' mean,
     Sergeant?

     SERGEANT
     Everyone was talking real slow, like when the batteries die on your
     Walkman.

     CROMWELL

     (Looks upon the sergeant disbelievingly.)
     Uh huh.

   [He points to a nearby hole covered with a metal lid.]

     CROMWELL
     Will that shaft take me directly to Sub-level 28?

     SERGEANT
     Yes, sir, but I don't know how you're going to get down there.

     CROMWELL
     Not to worry, we brought our own transportation.

   [He gestures to the shaft cover as his men come over. One of them
   produces a length of rope.]

     CROMWELL
     Gentlemen, hook 'em up. Bring it!

   [One of the men opens the shaft cover and Cromwell shines a light down
   it, aiming his weapon at the same time.]

     CROMWELL
     Clear.

   [The men prepare to rappell down the shaft.]

   INT--SGC--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

   [Hammond picks up the red phone that will connect him with the
   President.]

     HAMMOND
     This is Major General George Hammond. I have an urgent matter to
     discuss with the President.

   [He looks at the phone curiously, puts down the receiver and then
   leaves his office.]

   INT--SGC COMMAND CENTER

   [Carter is on a telephone headset giving instructions to Siler who is
   in the Gate room. The Stargate wormhole is still active.]

     CARTER
     Sergeant, try disconnecting the superconductive interface.

     SILER
     Already tried that, Captain. It's stuck.

     CARTER

     (To Teal'c)
     Teal'c, Siler could use a hand.

     TEAL'C
     I will assist.

   [Teal'c leaves the control room, and Carter heads up the stairs but
   meets General Hammond on the first landing.]

     HAMMOND
     Captain Carter.

     CARTER
     General. I was just on my way to report, sir. The capacitors should
     have fully discharged by now, but somehow, the Gate is drawing power
     directly.

     HAMMOND
     Isn't there supposed to be a theoretical time limit to how long a
     wormhole can be maintained?

     CARTER
     Yes, sir. We just passed it.

     HAMMOND
     Well, then how is this possible?

   [They head back down the stairs.]

     CARTER
     Well, since time is passing more slowly on P3W-451, relative to
     Earth, we're experiencing a paradox the Stargate was never designed
     for.

   [Hammond and Carter approach the window looking out over the Stargate.
   Teal'c is approaching the event horizon. The surface seems to be
   swirling and rippling oddly.]

     HAMMOND
     Why in God's name is it doing that?

     CARTER
     I have no idea, sir.

     O'NEILL
     It started just after you got online with the President.

     HAMMOND
     I never got through to the President.

   [Simmons turns and sheepishly looks over his shoulder at Hammond.]

     SIMMONS
     Beg your pardon, sir. It seems we've lost communication below
     Sub-level 24.

     HAMMOND
     Where is the nearest secure phone above that?

     SIMMONS
     NORAD, main level.

     HAMMOND
     I won't be gone long. In the meantime, Colonel--

     O'NEILL
     Understood, sir.

   [O'Neill gets up and looks at the Stargate, an idea in mind. He then
   looks at Carter, a curious look on his face.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter, what would happen if we simply pull the plug?

   [She looks at him, then the two of them look at the shimmering
   Stargate.]

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [Siler and O'Neill approach the fenced off area in one of the
   corridors. O'Neill unlocks the door and they go in.]

     O'NEILL
     All right, Carter. We've reached the main power vault.

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     We'll isolate the capacitors first.

   INT--SGC CONTROL CENTER

   [Simmons and Carter are near a power source in the Control Room.]

     SIMMONS
     Panel 6.

     CARTER
     Colonel, pull breakers 90 through 94 on panel 6.

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [O'Neill and Siler stare at a panel of circuit breakers.]

     O'NEILL
     Roger that. Stand by.

   [Both heavily gloved, they start shutting off switches.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL CENTER

   [Carter goes over to the microphone and switches it on.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     CARTER

     (over the P.A.)
     Stand clear, people. I have no idea what this is going to do.

     TEAL'C

     (To the technicians)
     We must vacate this area.

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [They finish throwing all the switches, and sparks begin to shoot out
   from a couple of panels.]

     O'NEILL
     All right. We're kind of shorting out up here.

   INT--SGC CONTROL CENTER

     CARTER

     (To Simmons)
     Main breaker?

     SIMMONS
     It'll overload.

     CARTER
     We got to do it. Colonel, pull the main breaker.

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [Siler and O'Neill head over to the main breaker. They both start
   throwing switches.]

     O'NEILL
     On one. 3. 2. 1.

   [O'Neill and Siler pull the main breakers simultaneously. The lights go
   off, then a feedback of power sends a current into Sgt. Siler.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Power surges around the Gate as Teal'c looks on, then currents of
   electricity begin to spark around the Gate power mechanisms. Teal'c is
   on the ramp and dives out of the way of the power surges.]

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [Sparks shower around O'Neill.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter runs to sit down at the monitor.]

     CARTER
     Colonel, are you all right?

     SIMMONS

     (Into the P.A. microphone)
     Medical emergency to the Gate room.

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

   [O'Neill makes his way over to Siler who's regaining consciousness.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Colonel, are you all right?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter waits and watches as the wormhole fades momentarily.]

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

     O'NEILL
     Siler's hurt. Did it work?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER
     Negative, sir. Even with the power cut, it still won't shut down.

   INT--SGC MAIN POWER VAULT

     O'NEILL
     How's that possible?

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     CARTER
     It must be deriving its energy from the black hole itself.

   [She turns to look at Simmons, then runs down the steps.]

     CARTER
     Get a med team to the main power vault. We got to get these fires
     out!

     SIMMONS

     (runs to the phone)
     Med team to the main power vault.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Armed soldiers pile into the corridor.]

     FEMALE VOICE

     (over P.A.)
     The Mountain is now on emergency internal power.

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c is struggling to rise from the floor. Carter races in to assist
   him to his feet.]

     CARTER
     Help is on the way.

   [Two med techs join them.]

     TEAL'C
     Do not concern yourself with my injury.

     CARTER
     You're badly burned, Teal'c, even for you.

   [Teal'c slowly turns as the med techs try to give him aid. His eyes
   fall on the event horizon.]

     TEAL'C
     The Stargate.

   [Smoke from the fires seems to be wafting through the wormhole. Carter
   walks up the ramp to the Stargate as Teal'c looks on and gets medical
   attention. Carter takes off her dog tags and holds them up to the
   wormhole. She watches as they're pulled into it. Startled, she whirls
   around to look towards the control room.]

     CARTER
     Lieutenant, close the iris!

     SIMMONS

     (through the P.A. mike.)
     It's an outgoing wormhole. Nothing can come through this way.

     CARTER
     Except for the black hole's gravity. Now close it! That's an order!

     SIMMONS

     (To another tech.)
     Close the iris.

   [Carter turns to watch as the iris closes. Simmons looks on as well.]

   INT--SGC--ELEVATOR

   [Hammond is on his way to the NORAD main level. As he reaches the main
   level and steps out of the elevator, a bright light is shined in his
   eyes as a young major recognizes him. The major steps in front of the
   men to keep them from shooting the commander of the SGC.]

     DAVIS
     Hold your fire! It's the general!

     HAMMOND
     What the hell's going on? Who are you?

     DAVIS
     Major Davis, sir. I'm with the Office of the Joint Chiefs. If you'll
     come with me, please.

     HAMMOND
     What are these men doing in my facility?

     DAVIS
     We were under the impression that there had been an alien incursion,
     sir. A Special Forces team had already been sent down before we
     understood what was going on. If it's all right with you, sir, I'd
     like to brief you on the way to your aircraft. Time is of the
     essence.

     HAMMOND
     We've got an emergency situation Major! I'm not going anywhere until
     I talk to the President!

     DAVIS
     He wants to talk to you personally, sir. Your aircraft is standing
     by on the tarmac. It is urgent that we leave immediately.

   [Hammond relents as the meaning of Davis' words finally sink in. He
   gestures for the major to precede him up the hallway and out the door.]

     HAMMOND
     Lead the way.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Fraiser is running through a darkened corridor on her way to main
   power vault. She stops when she sees the sparks from the cutting
   torches as whoever is using them finally breaks through the metal. The
   special forces team bursts through the door and she is spotted.]

     CROMWELL
     Freeze! Up against the wall!

   [She turns and puts her hands on the wall opposite her.]

     CROMWELL
     Move! Move! Tags!

   [She nervously holds out her tags and he looks at them.]

     CROMWELL
     Doctor Fraiser.

   [Angrily turning around to face him who is pointing a gun at her.]

     FRAISER
     Yeah. Who the hell are you? Put that down!

     CROMWELL

     (still pointing his weapon at her)
     Colonel Frank Cromwell, Air Force Special Operations. Five hours
     ago, all contact was lost with this facility. I am here to find out
     why.

     FRAISER
     Colonel, I have been called to a medical emergency.

     CROMWELL
     My superiors have reason to believe the SGC had been overrun by
     alien hostiles.

     FRAISER
     Well, all I can say is that they've been misinformed.

     CROMWELL

     Well, from what I've read about what goes on in this place, Doctor
     Fraiser--hell, you could be one of them for all I know. Move out!
     (She does as ordered)
     Take the six!

   [They head down the darkened hallway after her.]

   EXT--MOUNTAIN ROAD--NIGHT

   [Light rain is falling on a jeep and a Humvee driving down the road
   leading from the mountain. Focus on the interior of the jeep.]

     DAVIS
     We were hoping that someone such as yourself would come back up and
     confirm our hypothesis.

   [Hammond glares at Davis.]

     HAMMOND
     Which is?

     DAVIS
     We now know that the SGC is experiencing what is called time
     dilation. Time is quite literally passing slower within the facility
     than it is topside.

     HAMMOND
     That would explain the communications problem.

     DAVIS
     Yes, sir. We also know that there are only two things according to
     relativity that would cause this effect: velocities near the speed
     of light or extreme gravity.

     HAMMOND
     Approximately ten minutes ago, we established a wormhole to a planet
     at or very near the event horizon of a black hole.

     DAVIS

     Since time is more or less at a standstill on the other side, you've
     been unable to disengage the Stargate.
     (Hammond looks at him quizzically)
     That was our hypothesis, sir. Keep in mind we've had a few more
     hours than you have to think about this.

   [Hammond notes this.]

     DAVIS
     They'll be conferencing you with the President aboard the aircraft,
     sir.

   [They have arrived at the tarmac.]

     HAMMOND
     Thank you, Major.

   [Hammond exits the vehicle.]

     DAVIS
     Good luck, sir.

   [Aircraft takes off with the general aboard, headed for Washington
   D.C.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [The infirmary doors open and med techs are wheeling the gurney with
   Sgt. Siler on it. O'Neill follows. Carter looks on as the sergeant is
   wheeled in as Teal'c's is seen being attended to by one of the medical
   staff.]

     O'NEILL
     Siler took a pretty good hit. How're you doing, Teal'c?

     TEAL'C
     I suffered simple electrical burns, O'Neill. Nothing more.

     CARTER
     He'll be out of commission for a few days.

   [A rumbling sound is heard throughout the complex. O'Neill looks at
   Carter.]

     O'NEILL
     Carter?

     CARTER
     Gravity waves. Colonel, I assumed that the wormhole itself would
     insulate us from the black hole's gravitational field, but it seems
     that our space-time has begun to warp just like on P3W-451.

     O'NEILL
     Will you stop that?

     CARTER
     We're in trouble, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Thank you. Think of something.

   [O'Neill leaves the infirmary.]

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [O'Neill heads down a darkened corridor and guns cock as he runs into
   Fraiser and the Air Force Special Operations team. Fraiser calls out to
   O'Neill and Cromwell steps forward.]

     FRAISER
     Colonel!

     CROMWELL
     Clear!

   [O'Neill recognizes Fraiser, then sees Cromwell behind her.]

     O'NEILL
     Cromwell?

     FRAISER
     You know this guy, sir?

     O'NEILL

     Oh, yeah.
     (To Fraiser as he gestured up the corridor.)
     Go. Go on.

   [Fraiser leaves as he faces Cromwell.]

     O'NEILL
     It's been a while.

     CROMWELL
     Yeah. Five hours. Got everybody pretty worried upstairs. Where's the
     general?

     O'NEILL
     What's the five hours?

     CROMWELL
     That's how long this facility's been out of contact with the outside
     world. Pentagon suspected alien hostiles.

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     And they sent you?

   [Irritably, he walks past Cromwell. They then head for the control room
   overlooking the Embarkation Room. Cromwell gets his first view of the
   Stargate.]

     CROMWELL

     (whistles)
     So...this is the Stargate. What's the problem?

   [O'Neill taps the monitor with Boyd's frozen image.]

     O'NEILL
     Well, we gated to a planet that's being sucked up by a black hole.
     Very bad. Very dangerous.

     CROMWELL
     And why is that?

     O'NEILL

     (sarcastically)
     Things tend to get sucked in.

   [Carter enters the Control Room.]

     CARTER
     Took the liberty of closing the iris, sir.

     O'NEILL

     Captain Carter, Colonel Cromwell.
     (She salutes, and he returns it)
     He's come to rescue us. I wouldn't count on it.

     CROMWELL
     Pentagon was concerned you were under alien attack when we lost
     contact.

     CARTER
     How long ago was that?

     CROMWELL
     A little over five hours ago. Why?

     CARTER
     My watch reads 1330 hours. What does yours say?

     CROMWELL
     Running slow, Captain. It's almost 1900.

     CARTER
     Damn it. Colonel, I have to get off this level.

     SIMMONS

     (over the P.A., his voice distorted and slow)
     Captain Carter

   [Carter turns at the sound of Simmons calling her name and walks over
   to the control room's window and the P.A. mike.]

     CARTER
     What have you got, Lieutenant?

     SIMMONS

     (voice still distorted)
     The field is expanding. I'm reading over 7 Gs at the iris.

     CARTER

     Keep your distance, Lieutenant.
     (To O'Neill)
     Sir, for some reason, the warping of our space-time seems to be in
     advance of the gravitational field rather than as a result of it.
     It's probably a lensing effect generated by the Stargate itself, but
     I can't be sure.

   [O'Neill nods slowly. Cromwell turns to look at O'Neill.]

     CROMWELL
     Don't even pretend you understood that.

   [O'Neill rolls his eyes and looks away briefly.]

     CARTER
     The point is, sirs, time is passing more slowly down here than it is
     outside the mountain.

     CROMWELL
     Time is time.

     CARTER
     No, sir. Not according to relativity. Now with the intense gravity
     field of something like a black hole, time actually slows down.

     CROMWELL
     We're not in a black hole.

     O'NEILL
     Not yet.

     CARTER
     But we are connected to its gravitational field through the Stargate
     and it's expanding in this direction like a bubble slowly extending
     outward. That's why I have to leave, sir. I have to contact the
     Pentagon and try to find a solution before the gravity field extends
     beyond the Gate room.

   [Hammond enters the control room speaking.]

     HAMMOND
     I just came from there myself, Captain. Colonel Cromwell, I believe.

     CROMWELL

     (salutes)
     General Hammond.

     O'NEILL

     (incredulous)
     You just came from Washington, sir?

     HAMMOND
     There and back again. After someone upstairs managed to explain what
     was going on to me, we called an all-night session with the
     President and the Joint Chiefs. I've been gone nearly eighteen
     hours.

     O'NEILL

     (dryly)
     I thought you were on the phone.

     CARTER
     It means the time dilation is getting worse as the field expands.

     HAMMOND
     That's the consensus. We've set up a command post directly above,
     right on top of the mountain to monitor the expansion.

     CARTER
     I have to get up there.

     HAMMOND
     The experts we consulted believe we're going to have to commence an
     auto destruct sequence to destroy the Stargate itself.

     O'NEILL

     (irritated)
     Sweet.

     HAMMOND
     They assure me that the gravity field now present around the Gate
     will help to contain the blast within the mountain and pose no
     threat to the civilian population.

     CARTER
     With all due respect, sir. I don't think so.

     HAMMOND
     If we don't try, we lose the planet right through that.

     CARTER
     We may well succeed in destroying the base, sir, but leave the Gate
     and the wormhole intact. What happens to the planet then?

     HAMMOND
     Orders have been given at the highest level, Captain. It is our duty
     to carry out those orders.

     CARTER
     But, sir--

     HAMMOND
     The decision's been made, Captain. Don't forget those people up
     there've been working on this a lot longer than you have. It's what
     they came up with.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir.

     HAMMOND
     I'm ordering the complete evacuation of the SGC, effective as of
     right now. I'll need two volunteers to stay behind in order to give
     our personnel a head start.

     O'NEILL
     I'll stay, sir.

     CROMWELL
     Me too, sir.

   [O'Neill looks at Cromwell, then looks around the room hopefully.]

     O'NEILL
     Anyone else?

     CROMWELL
     Looks like you're stuck with me, Jack.

     HAMMOND
     Done! It takes two officers to initiate the countdown.

   [He walks over to the mike and looks out over the Gate room.]

     HAMMOND
     Attention! This is General Hammond. All personnel are ordered to
     evacuate this facility immediately! Repeat, all personnel report to
     the main level immediately! That is all!

   [Various shots around the SGC of everyone complying with Hammond's
   order.]

   INT--SGC INFIMARY

   [Siler lies in his bed and Teal'c comes over to assist in getting him
   out of there. A gurney is pulled next to the bed.]

     FRAISER
     Okay. Let's move him. On my count. 3. 2. 1.

   [Pulling the sheet, Teal'c assists the doctor and nurse in transferring
   Siler to the gurney.]

     FRAISER
     Easy. Watch his chest. Move him out! Let's go!

   [They roll him out of the room.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Hammond, Carter, O'Neill and Cromwell are standing. The monitors in
   the control room read "EVAC".]

     HAMMOND
     Wait five minutes, then start the countdown. Good luck.

     CROMWELL
     Thank you, sir.

     CARTER
     Make sure you give yourself enough time to get out, sir.

     O'NEILL
     Time...right.

   [Carter and Hammond leave. Cromwell and O'Neill look at each other.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--DAY

   [Trucks exit the mountain and personnel including the general and
   Carter exit from the door near the ground entrance. A sergeant
   approaches him, and he returns his salute.]

     SERGEANT
     General. We were getting worried.

     HAMMOND
     How long have I been gone?

     SERGEANT
     22 hours, sir. General Cohen's waiting for you in the command post.

     HAMMOND
     Thank you, Sergeant.

   [He turns to look at Carter, who is standing beside him.]

     HAMMOND
     By my reckoning, I was gone 20 minutes.

     CARTER
     Well, sir, accounting for time spent coming and going, I would guess
     that time within the SGC facility has slowed to an average of about
     600 percent below normal. When you ordered Colonel O'Neill to wait 5
     minutes, you were really telling him to wait 6 hours, maybe more.

     HAMMOND
     Captain, relativity gives me a headache.

   [Hammond walks away from her and into the command tent, and Carter
   follows after a few seconds.]

   INT--SGC COMMAND CENTER

   [Cromwell looks up at the MALP telemetry and sees Henry Boyd. He turns
   back to look at O'Neill.]

     CROMWELL
     Who's this?

     O'NEILL
     Henry Boyd. Good officer. Smart. Kinda reminds me of Carter a
     little. This was their first mission as a team.

     CROMWELL
     He looks scared to death.

     O'NEILL
     He's on a planet that's about to be swallowed up by a black hole and
     he knows it.

   [Fade from Major Boyd's face on the monitors.]

   INT--COMMAND TENT TOPSIDE

   [Fade from previous scene to Carter working on some calculations on a
   dry erase board. An airman offers her a cup of coffee, which she
   takes.]

     CARTER
     Thank you.

   [He offers her a doughnut, which she starts to take, then puts back
   into the box.]

     CARTER
     Uh--no, thank you.

   [She licks the glaze off her fingers. She sighs and takes a sip of
   coffee. Teal'c approaches her and looks upon her calculations. He puts
   a gentle hand on her shoulder.]

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps with rest, the answers will come.

     CARTER
     Hey, Teal'c. You know anything about quantum gravity?

     TEAL'C
     Nothing.

     CARTER
     Apparently, neither do I.

     TEAL'C
     What do these equations represent?

     CARTER
     Probably a life's work. I don't have that much time, unfortunately.

   [She sits down. He sits down next to her.]

     TEAL'C
     How may I be of assistance?

     CARTER
     We're experiencing a time dilation in a radius wider than the Gate
     room itself. Most of the SGC in fact and it's expanding. But it's
     all happening in advance of the gravity field that's causing it. Now
     according to everything I thought I knew about relativity, that is
     just not possible.

     TEAL'C
     Yet it is so.

     CARTER
     Right. I mean, i-if it wasn't, we'd all be pulled apart by now. You
     know, they're proceeding with a plan that makes assumptions about
     gravity and space-time with absolutely no regard for the fact that
     it completely contradicts our observations.

     TEAL'C
     I see.

     CARTER
     In other words, Teal'c, they don't really know what the hell is
     going on, so they're just going to blow it up. There doesn't seem to
     be a damn thing I can do about it.

   [She sighs, and she and Teal'c sit there staring at the calculations on
   the board. Scene fades to next.]

   INT--SGC COMMAND CENTER

   [Fades from previous scene to O'Neill and Cromwell as they get ready to
   set up to initiate the auto destruct.]

     O'NEILL

     (Quietly)
     Let's get set up. Computer needs your authorization code before
     it'll accept the command. Go ahead and enter it.

   [They both start typing in to their respective computers. While the
   computers process, Cromwell turns to address O'Neill.]

     CROMWELL
     Maybe now you know how it feels.

     O'NEILL

     (Not looking at him)
     You done?

     CROMWELL
     Roger that.

     O'NEILL
     When the time comes, hit the 'enter' key on my mark...and then run
     like hell.

     CROMWELL
     Got it.

   [O'Neill shakes his head irritably then looks at his watch.]

     O'NEILL
     Two minutes.

   [Cromwell turns to look at O'Neill, who still has his back to him.]

   INT--COMMAND POST TOPSIDE

   [A computer image of the Gate room displays the expansion of the time
   dilation field. Carter is at the monitor, and General Hammond sits down
   next to her. She points to the screen.]

     CARTER
     The gravity field extends to the blast doors of the control room
     now, sir. It's not good.

     HAMMOND
     I take it you still believe our plan isn't going to work?

     CARTER
     To be honest, sir, I'm afraid that the gravity field will dampen the
     effects of the explosion. We'll lose the SGC, but the wormhole will
     be intact. What's left of the mountain will collapse into the
     wormhole. Six months after that, the state of Colorado. Six months
     after that--

   [She turns away from the general and sighs.]

     CARTER
     At least Daniel will live out there.

     HAMMOND
     If you're wrong, and for once I hope you are, we can restart the SGC
     with the second Stargate at Nellis and in time we--

     CARTER
     Wait a minute. Sir, that's it. We do use a bomb, but we focus the
     energy of the blast.

   [He looks at her quizzically.]

     CARTER
     When Colonel O'Neill and I were sent to the Antarctic Gate, it was
     because we were under enemy fire.

     HAMMOND
     It caused an energy surge.

     CARTER

     Yes, and that surge caused the wormhole to jump from one destination
     to another.
     (To elucidate, she holds up a doughnut and motions to the hole.)
     If we can channel enough energy in the direction of our Stargate, it
     should cut the connection with the black hole and cause the matter
     stream to jump to any Gate along the way.

     HAMMOND
     Leaving our Stargate connected to some other world.

     CARTER
     Yes, sir, but then all we have to do is shut it down. Sir, we have
     to stop Colonel O'Neill.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [O'Neill has entered something into the computer by keyboard and is
   straightening up. He glances at the monitor on which Major Boyd's face
   is still displayed. He then walks over to a console and glances at his
   watch.]

     O'NEILL
     One minute.

   [Cromwell looks at him.]

     CROMWELL
     Maybe the last one.

   [He takes a couple of tentative steps in O'Neill's direction.]

     CROMWELL
     We used to be friends, Jack.

     O'NEILL

     (Not looking at him)
     Yep.

     CROMWELL
     I was sick to my stomach when I found out you were still alive. I
     wanted to go back for you.

     O'NEILL
     Why don't we just do this and get the hell out of here, all right?

     CROMWELL
     Somebody dropped a dime on the incursion. You got hit, you went
     down. I made a judgement call to save the rest of the team.

     O'NEILL

     (Angrily turns to face him.)
     And I saw you take off. And then I saw four months of my life
     disappear in some stinking Iraqi prison.

     CROMWELL
     I thought you were dead!

     O'NEILL
     You thought wrong! What do you want? You want me to forgive you, is
     that it?

     CROMWELL
     Yeah, I guess I do.

     O'NEILL
     Well, that's tough. What happened to "nobody gets left behind"?

     CROMWELL

     (Points to the monitor and Boyd's image)
     Well, what about him?

     O'NEILL
     That is a totally different scenario.

     CROMWELL

     (Forcefully)
     That is the same damn thing, Jack.

   [The glass from the control room windows begins to buckle and shatter
   and is drawn toward the Stargate. O'Neill and Cromwell drop to the
   floor as the broken glass impacts against the iris. Carter and Siler
   walk into the control room.]

     CARTER
     Don't activate the auto destruct, sir. It won't work. I have another
     idea.

   [She looks out upon the Gate.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Siler, a bandage on his head is dispensing out a rope that is being
   pulled by the gravitational pull of the wormhole while Carter watches.
   She walks over to Cromwell and O'Neill who have donned special
   G-suits.]

     CARTER
     The g-suits should help you withstand the higher gravity on the way
     down.

     CROMWELL
     What's this bomb we're delivering?

     CARTER

     It's a shaped charge. We want to focus the explosive force toward
     the wormhole, hopefully with enough energy to cause it to jump...
     (to O'Neill)
     ...like what happened to us in Antarctica.

     O'NEILL

     (Quietly)
     Right.

     CROMWELL
     Where is it?

     CARTER
     They're modifying the warhead yield to my calculations, and it's
     being flown in from Travis.

     CROMWELL
     How long's all that going to take?

     CARTER
     Well, sir, with any luck, about 5 more minutes, relatively--

     O'NEILL
     Relatively speaking?

   [The ropes's ends extend out over the iris.]

     SILER
     Anytime you're ready, sirs. I don't know how much longer that iris
     is going to hold.

     CARTER

     (To Siler)
     We have to wait for the bomb.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AN ELEVATOR

   [The elevator doors open revealing Teal'c who is carrying the bomb. He
   heads down the hallway.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Teal'c walks up the steps and hands the bomb over to Carter and
   Siler.]

     O'NEILL

     (To Teal'c)
     You got better quick.

     TEAL'C
     It has in fact been several days.

     O'NEILL

     (Looks at him briefly)
     Yeah. I knew that.

     CARTER
     Everyone who doesn't have to be here should go topside.

   [They are connecting the bomb.]

     O'NEILL
     Cromwell.

   [He motions the other man to end of the rope and they begin to attach
   themselves to it.]

     TEAL'C
     Cannot the bomb be detonated by remote?

     CARTER
     It has to be set a certain distance from the Gate and at an exact
     angle. The timer can't be set until they're into position because of
     the variance in time dilation.

     CROMWELL
     Man, she is--

     O'NEILL
     Way smarter than we are. I know.

   [Cromwell and O'Neill begin climbing across the console along the line
   toward the Stargate as the others watch from the control room.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [O'Neill and Cromwell are seen sliding horizontally along the rope. The
   bomb is also being guided through the window of the control room and
   towards the Gate. Carter and Teal'c look on intently from the control
   room as Siler slowly feeds the rope through the window.]

     CROMWELL
     Just like old times, huh, Jack?

     O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. Black holes, wormholes. Just like old times.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN TOPSIDE--NIGHT

   [General Hammond stands in front of the command tent. Lieutenant
   Simmons walks up to him and offers him a cup of coffee, which he
   takes.]

     SIMMONS
     Sir?

     HAMMOND
     Thank you, Lieutenant.

     SIMMONS
     Do you think they'll be able to shut it down, sir?

     HAMMOND
     We'll know sometime tomorrow.

   [Simmons leaves and the general drinks his coffee.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Cromwell and O'Neill are still making their way "down" the ropes.
   Carter, Teal'c and Siler watch from the control room.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [An overhead shot of the wormhole shows a vortex has been created
   behind the Stargate.]

     O'NEILL

     (Straining)
     Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're pulling some major gees now.

     CROMWELL
     I feel like I put on a couple hundred pounds.

     O'NEILL
     I wasn't going to say anything.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     TEAL'C
     They appear to be moving very slowly.

     CARTER
     Only from our perspective.

     SILER
     Ah, Captain.

   [A chair begins to roll tow ardtheconsole.Anotherglasspanelbreaksand
   shatters and heads toward the two dangling men.]

     CARTER
     Colonel! Colonel, look out! Colonel!

   [Her voice echoes through the room. The glass is very slowly moving out
   of its frames.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

     CROMWELL
     Did you hear that?

   [O'Neill looks back at the control room and sees the glass headed their
   way.]

     O'NEILL
     Look out!

   [Glass comes flying toward them and they tuck to avoid it as it passes
   them and shatters against the iris. A piece lodges in Cromwell's line.
   They recover, but Cromwell has cuts on his arm and face.]

     CROMWELL
     Are you all right?

     O'NEILL
     This is close enough! Set the timer! 20 seconds!

     CROMWELL
     We won't make it out.

     O'NEILL
     20 seconds!

   [Cromwell moves up to the bomb and hits a few buttons while O'Neill
   looks at the iris which is straining under the pull.]

     CROMWELL
     Set!

     O'NEILL
     Do it!

   [The iris starts to break apart and crumbles into the wormhole. O'Neill
   is nearly drawn into it, but Cromwell flips over and grasps onto
   O'Neill. From Carter and Teal'c's perspective, the two men are in slow
   motion.]

     CROMWELL
     I got you!

     O'NEILL
     Get up there and arm that damn bomb!

     CROMWELL
     I've got you! Just climb!

     O'NEILL
     Arm the damn bomb!

     CROMWELL
     Climb!

   [The glass shard lodged in Cromwell's rope eventually cuts it through
   and Cromwell is pulled toward it, but O'Neill catches hold him before
   he goes in. O'Neill struggles to hold Cromwell as Teal'c and Carter
   look on. , Cromwell looks at O'Neill. O'Neill strains and pulls, but
   the look on Cromwell's face is calm and peaceful. He knows that if
   O'Neill holds onto him, he'll end up taking both of them into the black
   hole. Cromwell doesn't try to latch on to him. He lets go and falls
   into the black hole even as O'Neill tries to grab onto him. O'Neill
   hangs there precariously watching the maelstrom, then he struggles set
   himself straight again on the rope and he peers back down regretfully
   at the wormhole. He then starts to climb up the rope to set the bomb.
   He gets there, pulls a pin and tries to climb out of there. The time
   ticks down from 18 seconds. Teal'c watches O'Neill climb then hurries
   to the rope to assist even as Carter calls for him to help.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c, pull him up!

   [Teal'c strains to pull O'Neill up with Carter and Siler assisting him.
   Intermittent cuts from O'Neill climbing to Teal'c and Carter pulling
   him to the counter on the bomb counting down. Teal'c pulls and as the
   counter hits zero, O'Neill slowly looks up and the bomb explodes and
   fades the Gate room to white.]

   INT--SGC INFIRMARY

   [White fades to an overhead light over an infirmary bed. Monitors beep
   as Fraiser moves the light out of the way and Daniel joins Fraiser by
   O'Neill's bedside as he is finally awake. A bandage is in place on
   O'Neill's neck where the glass cut him. Daniel is self-hugging. Carter
   and Hammond move in behind Daniel.]

     DANIEL

     (Concerned and solemn)
     Hey, Jack. Did I miss anything?

   [Teal'c joins them, too.]

     O'NEILL

     (weakly)
     I made it.

     HAMMOND
     We all made it, thanks to you and Captain Carter.

     O'NEILL
     How?

     CARTER
     Teal'c managed to pull you far enough away from the bomb before it
     went off.

     O'NEILL

     (To Teal'c)
     Thanks.

     TEAL'C
     You are welcome.

     CARTER
     The majority of the blast energy went right where it was supposed
     to. The wormhole jumped to P2A-270 and once it did that, we shut it
     off.

     O'NEILL
     Good thinking, Captain.

     CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

     HAMMOND
     A new trinium-strengthened iris is being installed right now. We
     should be back in business in no time.

     O'NEILL
     What day is it?

   [Daniel looks at Carter then back at O'Neill.]

     DANIEL
     Well, this might be a little difficult to accept, but since you
     reported for duty yesterday, two weeks have actually gone by.

     O'NEILL
     Two weeks? Think I'll sleep in.

     HAMMOND

     (Smiles warmly)
     You do that.
