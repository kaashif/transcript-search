# Stargate Script Search Tool

This is a dump of the text from
[here](http://www.stargate-sg1-solutions.com/wiki/Transcripts). Eventually
I will also write a tool that will let you search for text by scene,
character, season, episode etc.


##Copyright

The scripts and anything I have written are under the MIT license. The
transcripts themselves are provided under the Fair Use doctrine of US
copyright law. The credit for typing out the transcripts goes to the
individual authors, the names of whom are included in each file.
