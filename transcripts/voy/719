Natural Law
Stardate: 54827.7
Original Airdate: 2 May 2001
[Shuttlecraft]
(A standard Starfleet shuttlecraft is flying over a lush green forest.)
CHAKOTAY: Beautiful, isnt it?
SEVEN: A sensor analysis would have provided the necessary information.
CHAKOTAY: Just admiring the view.
SEVEN: The conference begins in less than an hour.
CHAKOTAY: Theres always time for Warp Field Dynamics, but you dont see natural beauty like this every day.
(Whumph)
CHAKOTAY: What was that?
SEVEN: Some kind of energy barrier directly below us. It spans thousands of square kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: Why didnt our sensors detect it?
SEVEN: Uncertain. It has an unusual tetrion signature. Species three one two used a similar technology. Theres a power surge coming from the barrier.
CHAKOTAY: Shields at full.
SEVEN: Theyre creating some kind of feedback. Weve lost impulse engines.
CHAKOTAY: Go to warp.
SEVEN: The warp core is offline.
CHAKOTAY: Warp engines dont just shut down when you scrape an energy barrier.
SEVEN: Its affecting all our systems.
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds.
CHAKOTAY: Well have to beam to the surface.
SEVEN: We cant transport through the barrier. Transfer auxiliary power to the weapons array.
CHAKOTAY: What are you trying to do?
SEVEN: If I can realign our phasers to the correct frequency, I may be able to open a rift.
CHAKOTAY: Big enough to get a shuttle through, I hope?
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in ten seconds, nine, eight.
SEVEN: Phasers reconfigured.
(Chakotay fires the phaser and flies the shuttlecraft through the resulting hole. They lose the nacelles as they go through, and beam out as the shuttlecraft tumbles to the ground.)
[Jungle]
SEVEN: The barriers closed again.
(Chakotay's leg has been cut. He can barely walk on it.)
SEVEN: I should examine you.
CHAKOTAY: I dont think its serious.
(He sits on a nearby log.)
SEVEN: You have a hairline fracture.
CHAKOTAY: We've got bigger problems. Ill be fine.
SEVEN: Im detecting shuttle debris scattered over several square kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: Some of it might still be functional.
SEVEN: If we can find the right components, we may be able to construct a beacon. Send a distress signal.
CHAKOTAY: Through the barrier?
SEVEN: Maybe.
CHAKOTAY: If we hurry we might still make that conference. Well, if we have to be stranded somewhere, we couldnt ask for a nicer place.
SEVEN: We wouldnt be stranded at all if you hadnt insisted on admiring the view.
[Delta Flyer]
(Paris pilots the Flyer to an orbital platform.)
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Guest Vessel 74656, this is Ledos Port Control. Shut down your engines.
PARIS: This is Lieutenant Tom Paris. Is there a problem?
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: You were observed committing piloting violation two five six.
PARIS: I'm sorry, Im not familiar with your regulations. It wont happen again.
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Youll be informed of the penalty.
PARIS: What kind of penalty?
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Thats not my decision. Your docking permit says youre assigned to the starship Voyager?
PARIS: Thats right.
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Your commanding officer will be notified of your infraction.
[Ready Room]
PARIS: Piloting lessons?
JANEWAY: Apparently, the standard penalty for your infraction is a three day course in flight safety, followed by a test.
PARIS: Well, did you explain we wouldnt be here that long?
JANEWAY: Actually, while you were completing your mission, Seven was invited to a four day conference.
PARIS: Here on Ledos?
JANEWAY: I decided to give the entire crew shore leave. It'll give you plenty of time to brush up on your piloting skills.
PARIS: I dont need lessons.
JANEWAY: Apparently the authorities disagree.
PARIS: But Captain
JANEWAY: You may not have known the Ledosians rules, but you know ours. Comply with local law. Understood?
PARIS: Yes, maam.
[Jungle]
(Seven finds a small piece of the shuttlecraft.)
SEVEN: The relays are fused. Its useless.
(Chakotay's tricorder has picked up something else.)
CHAKOTAY: Looks like were not the only ones here.
SEVEN: Indigenous wildlife, perhaps.
CHAKOTAY: Im reading residual lifesigns. Theyre humanoid.
SEVEN: Ledosian?
CHAKOTAY: No. But they share the same genetic traits. Whoever they are, they may be able to help us.
SEVEN: Unless theyre hostile.
CHAKOTAY: Why dont we give them the benefit of the doubt. The lifesigns lead in that direction.
SEVEN: I suggest you rest your leg while I investigate.
CHAKOTAY: Its better is we stick together, at least until we know whether theyre hostile.
[Above a clearing]
(Chakotay leans on Seven's shoulder as they make their way up a slope to look down on a group of people. One seems to be making a stone tool. They are wearing minimal leather garments and strings of beads.)
CHAKOTAY: Im guessing theyre pre-warp.
SEVEN: Obviously they cant help us.
CHAKOTAY: No, I dont suppose they can. But theyre fascinating, aren't they? I never expected to run into people like these on such a technologically advanced planet.
SEVEN: This isnt an anthropological mission, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: Youre right. We should keep searching for debris. Argh!
(He collapses in pain.)
SEVEN: Youre developing an infection. You should rest.
CHAKOTAY: Ill have to stay here and try to keep out of sight.
SEVEN: Ill contact you if I find anything useful.
CHAKOTAY: I guess I dont have to tell you to avoid interacting with these people.
(Chakotay rests against a tree trunk.)
[Jungle]
(Seven locates another small piece of the shuttlecraft. It is still working.)
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to Chakotay.
[Above a clearing]
SEVEN [OC]: Seven of Nine to Chakotay.
(A red hand is reaching for the comm. badge. Chakotay pushes it away and opens his eyes to see three natives in front of him.)
SEVEN [OC]: Commander, respond. Ive found something. Seven of Nine to Chakotay.
(One native snatches the comm. badge and smashes it with a stone. Seven puts the retrieved part in a case and walks on.)
[Cave - night]
(Seven sneaks past a group of natives gathered around a fire and tracks Chakotay's bio-signal to a cave. She finds Chakotay lying on a blanket, surrounded by natives.)
SEVEN: Step away from him.
(Her wrist beacon frightens them.)
CHAKOTAY: Its all right, Seven. Theyre friendly. Theyre treating my wound.
(His injured leg has been put in a splint. She turns off her beacon.)
SEVEN: You said we were supposed to avoid interaction.
CHAKOTAY: They found me. There was nothing I could do.
SEVEN: You should have tried to contact me.
CHAKOTAY: I didnt want to expose them to our technology.
SEVEN: You hid your comm. badge?
CHAKOTAY: Actually, your call scared them. They broke it.
SEVEN: I suggest we leave before they break anything else.
CHAKOTAY: Look, theyre friendly, and I am hurt.
SEVEN: What are you suggesting?
CHAKOTAY: We may as well stay the night.
SEVEN: Commander.
CHAKOTAY: Its good shelter. And my leg feels better since they put this dressing on. Im going to get some rest. I suggest you do the same.
(Seven sits near Chakotay. One young girl reaches out and touches her cortical implant.)
[Corridor]
KIM: Chell says we shouldnt miss the Flame Gardens.
NEELIX: I hear the arboretum is beautiful, too.
TORRES: We can do both.
KIM: Tom. You joining us? Oh, thats right, you have to go to pilot school.
TORRES: I hear the course takes days.
PARIS: Yeah, for most people. But I did a little research. If the instructor agrees, you can skip the lessons and go right to the test. So I will be seeing you in a couple of hours.
NEELIX: You  have to admire his optimism.
[Transporter Room]
TRANSPORTER OPERATOR: Just a moment, sir.
(An elderly man is beamed aboard.)
KLEG: I am Mister Kleg, the flying instructor. Are you Lieutenant Paris?
KIM: He is.
PARIS: Its an honour to meet you, sir. May I show you to the Delta Flyer?
KLEG: Why?
PARIS: So you can explain what I did wrong, and then administer the test.
KLEG: It sounds to me like you need lessons in patience as well.
TORRES: Oh, Tom is very patient, sir.
NEELIX: Never impulsive.
KIM: Take all the time you need. Hell enjoy the extra attention.
KLEG: Well, Im please to hear it. Well start with a review of safety procedures. Do you have a visual display system I can access?
PARIS: I think I can find one.
TORRES: Have fun.
KIM: Energise.
(Kim, Neelix and Torres are beamed away.)
PARIS: So how long will this review take?
KLEG: Oh, typically about four hours. But there's no rush.
PARIS: Of course not.
[Clearing - day]
(Chakotay is drawing a map in the dust for a local man. The young girl comes to watch, too.)
CHAKOTAY: River.
(The man looks blank, so he pours water onto the wavy line.)
CHAKOTAY: River.
(The man holds one arm horizontal across his body and the other underneath with the fingers moving. Chakotay copies him, then puts a stone next to the line on the ground.)
CHAKOTAY: Mountain.
(He points to it behind them.)
CHAKOTAY: Mountain.
(The man makes a fist rising upwards. Chakotay adds gestures to his own words.)
CHAKOTAY: Where are we?
(The man points to the place on the ground, then touches Chakotay's rank insignia.)
CHAKOTAY: This?
(The man takes a small item from his pouch, then gestures to Chakotay and himself and holds his palm out flat.)
CHAKOTAY: You want to trade? Well, I suppose it won't hurt.
(They trade items. The man gathers air into his hand and brings it to his heart.)
CHAKOTAY: I'll take that as a thank you.
(Seven returns.)
SEVEN: Did you make a favourable exchange?
CHAKOTAY: I didn't want to insult their customs. Any luck?
SEVEN: I may have found a way of communicating.
CHAKOTAY: Me too. I've learned to say thank you.
(He demonstrates. The girl is watching Seven.)
SEVEN: I was referring to communication with Voyager. It may be possible to construct a beacon by connecting these components to the shuttle's deflector.
CHAKOTAY: Did you find it?
SEVEN: I detected it six kilometres from here. I believe it's intact.
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I'm up to that long a trip.
SEVEN: I'll go.
CHAKOTAY: I've started mapping the area. Here's the river we passed. This is where we beamed down. And we're here now.
SEVEN: Then the deflector should be approximately here.
CHAKOTAY: Six kilometres is a long way. Maybe one of them could guide you.
SEVEN: I'm still trying to limit our contact with these people.
CHAKOTAY: The sooner you get to the deflector, the sooner we can get out of here. They know the terrain. Maybe they can get you there faster.
SEVEN: And watch me construct a tetrion-based signalling device.
CHAKOTAY: All right, but be careful. Seven. This is how they say goodbye.
(A fist over the heart, then the arm extends out with an open downward palm. Seven leaves. She manages to trip over a tree root and lose her tricorder down a hole in the ground. As she cannot reach it, she moves on. Back at the clearing, the man makes Chakotay a stout walking stick.)
CHAKOTAY: Thank you.
(He hobbles over to a group of teenagers, and gestures fist over heart opening all fingers palm outwards.)
CHAKOTAY: Hello.
(Then he sees that they are painting copies of his tattoo on each other.)
[Jungle]
(It's dark, and a storm is brewing. Seven stumbles over a log and finds that she is walking in circles. Her hair is coming loose from its pleat. She sits down and hugs herself. There is a rustling nearby.)
SEVEN: Identify yourself.
(The girl comes and puts a blanket over Seven's shoulders, then scrapes a couple of stones together before squeezing the oils from nearby fruits on them to make a fire.)
SEVEN: An exothermic reaction.
(Seven turns off her wrist beacon as the fire brightens. She is offered part of a stick of dried food.)
SEVEN: I'm not hungry.
[Delta Flyer]
(In the shuttlebay, an impartial eye is not impressed with the craft's design.)
KLEG: Inadequate system integration. Visibility impaired by lateral sensor array. Insufficient console accessibility.
PARIS: You know, I couldn't agree more. Those are some of the defects that led to my so-called pilot error.
KLEG: Polarity thrusters? Oh, they've been known to cause accidental acceleration.
PARIS: Exactly my point. Why should I be held responsible for the ship's design flaws?
KLEG: According to the maintenance records, you were this vessel's chief designer. I make it a point of professional pride to research every case I'm assigned to. Are you familiar with that term, Lieutenant? Professional pride?
PARIS: Yes, sir. In fact, that is why I'm so eager to get underway. I want to prove to you that I'm a good pilot.
KLEG: There are protocols, Mister Paris. System by system diagnostics, pre-flight simulations.
PARIS: You must have other students who need your attention. It wouldn't be fair to
KLEG: Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'm planning to spend as much time with you as you need.
[Jungle - day]
(Seven wakes. The sky is clear and the birds are singing. The girl makes an open palms rising upwards gesture.)
SEVEN: Good morning.
(Seven makes a half-hearted response to the gesture. The girl offers food again, and this time it is accepted. Seven draws a map in the dirt)
SEVEN: Im trying to go here.
(The girl points.)
SEVEN: Can you show me?
(The girl leads the way. They stop by some bright plants.)
SEVEN: Yes. I thought it was this way.
(But the girl shows her a triple waterfall instead.)
SEVEN: Yes, its quite an impressive view. Now we really have to
(But the girl sits to look for a while, so Seven joins her.)
[Clearing]
(Chakotay goes to the man and touches his head and the back of his hand, indicating Seven's implants.)
CHAKOTAY: My friend, she hasnt come back. I need to find her.
(Chakotay draws in the dirt.)
CHAKOTAY: She looks like this. Where?
(The man gestures stay her, then brings a young woman to him, with a small piece of shuttle circuitry tied over her left eye)
CHAKOTAY: Where'd you get this?
(They show him a bag full of metal bits.)
CHAKOTAY: My friend. Where?
[Debris field]
(The nosecone of the shuttlecraft is stuck in the ground. The girl goes to touch a sharp edge.)
SEVEN: Dont touch that! Please.
(Her tone of voice is enough. The girl moves away as Seven works.)
[Astrometrics]
JANEWAY: Problem?
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay failed to report in at the scheduled time. We tried hailing, but there was no response.
KIM: We contacted the conference coordinator. He said Seven and Chakotay never showed up.
JANEWAY: Anything on sensors?
KIM: We've located a hull signature over the southern subcontinent, but its only a wing.
JANEWAY: Nothing else? No lifesigns?
KIM: No, maam.
JANEWAY: Thats awfully low for something to be in orbit.
TUVOK: Its not in orbit. Its resting on an energy barrier.
KIM: We think the shuttle may have collided with it.
JANEWAY: Why didnt they see it?
TUVOK: Standard scans didnt reveal its presence. We were only able to detect it with our Borg sensors.
JANEWAY: If all you found was a wing, maybe the rest of the shuttle made it through the barrier.
TUVOK: Logic suggests that possibility. Unfortunately, the barrier's deflecting all our scans. Theres no way to know if the shuttle or its occupants are on the other side.
JANEWAY: Hail the Ledosian ambassador.
[Bridge]
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Wed have warned your Commander, but his flight plan didnt go anywhere near that area.
JANEWAY: He must have altered his route for some reason.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: And collided with the barrier. Im sorry.
JANEWAY: Were not assuming theyre dead.
TUVOK: We believe they may have found a way through.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Thats very unlikely.
JANEWAY: Theyre resourceful people. Can you tell us anything about the barrier?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: It shields the territory of an indigenous society, the Ventu.
JANEWAY: Then the areas habitable. If you lowered the barrier, we could scan for our peoples lifesigns.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Im afraid we cant do that.
JANEWAY: Why not?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: It was erected by aliens hundreds of years ago. They havent been back. The technology is a mystery to us.
TUVOK: Why did these aliens build the barrier?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: To protect the Ventu.
JANEWAY: From whom?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Us. Our ancestors fought them, polluted their habitat. Im afraid we werent very enlightened back then.
JANEWAY: Earth went through its dark periods too, Ambassador. Would you have any objections if we tried to lower the barrier, just to scan for our people?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I told you, its not possible.
TUVOK: Perhaps if you gave us information about the barriers power source?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: The generator is inside. Theres no way to access it. Even if your people did survive, Im afraid theres no way to get them out.
Captains log, stardate 54827.7. Although the Ledosians are sceptical, theyre allowing us to try to locate our people. Meanwhile, we've begun to analyse the shuttle fragment.
[Engineering]
TORRES: The burn patterns suggest a tetrion flux.
TUVOK: We found a reference to similar technology in Sevens Borg database.
JANEWAY: You think the Borg erected it?
TUVOK: No, but it may have been constructed by people they later assimilated. Species three one two.
JANEWAY: If Seven were here, she might be able to figure out a way to get through it.
TORRES: Maybe she already did. Some of the damage to the wing was caused by feedback from the shuttles phasers.
JANEWAY: Seven and Chakotay might have used them to penetrate the barrier for some reason.
TUVOK: If I can determine the appropriate frequency, I may be able to do the same thing. But there is risk involved.
JANEWAY: What sort of risk?
TORRES: It looks like the feedback from the barrier is what destroyed the shuttle. If were not careful the same thing could happen to Voyager.
[Debris field]
(The girl is making bracelets from pieces of magnetic rock. Seven activates her communication device, but the energy arcs to a nearby group of pebbles and fails.)
SEVEN: May I see those?
(Chakotay arrives with the man.)
CHAKOTAY: Seven, is everything all right?
SEVEN: I need your tricorder.
CHAKOTAY: Nice to see you, too.
SEVEN: I lost mine. Theres a strong magnetic field here thats preventing me from generating a deflector beam. But the field drops off approximately four point eight kilometres in that direction.
CHAKOTAY: Can you transmit the signal from there?
SEVEN: Not through the barrier, but I may be able to neutralise it by generating a dampening field with our deflector.
CHAKOTAY: Even if youre right, this must weight five hundred kilos. How would we move it?
SEVEN: Some of them could help us.
CHAKOTAY: We shouldnt involve them.
SEVEN: Do I detect a change in attitude, Commander?
CHAKOTAY: Your concern was justified. Theyve been gathering debris from the shuttle, using it to imitate us. I dont want them helping.
SEVEN: Whats the alternative? Staying here? Allowing them to find all of the debris? If we neutralise the barrier, Voyager can transport us and our technology off the surface.
CHAKOTAY: Is there a possibility that this dampening field could disrupt the barrier permanently?
SEVEN: Unlikely. Once the deflector is deactivated the barrier should reinitialise.
CHAKOTAY: Lets hope youre right.
[Delta Flyer]
(The Flyer is negotiating a test course marked with beacons.)
KLEG: So you can execute a turn at less than three hundred kph. Well done, Lieutenant.
PARIS: Thanks. You know, I dont want to seem impatient again, but is there any way youd let me take that test now?
KLEG: I thought Id made myself clear about that. All my students complete the entire course.
PARIS: I understand, sir, but two of my friends are missing, and Id like to help find them.
KLEG: Well, thats an admirable sentiment. But if I give you special treatment it wouldnt be fair to the others who have to take this course. Besides, why stop now? Youre getting very close to becoming an adequate pilot.
[Rocky Rise]
(The Ventu are helping drag the nose cone, which presumably contains the shuttle's deflector, up a slope.)
SEVEN: Here, Commander.
(The natives put down their ropes and stand aside.)
SEVEN: Not so close.
[Bridge]
(Voyager tries to phaser the barrier. They get feedback along the energy line.)
KIM: Phasers are starting to overload.
JANEWAY: Can we divert any more power to the shields?
TUVOK: The shields are amplifying the feedback.
TORRES: The barrier's interfering with every system we activate.
JANEWAY: Cease fire. Im open to suggestions.
TUVOK: We may be able to reconfigure a photon torpedo to detonate at the appropriate frequency.
JANEWAY: What about feedback?
TUVOK: A torpedo shouldnt create any. Theoretically.
JANEWAY: Do it.
[Rocky Rise]
(Chakotay and Seven set up the communicator. The natives lean in to watch.)
SEVEN: Theyre too close.
CHAKOTAY: Back, behind the rise. Stay back.
(Seven starts up the deflector and moves away, as the girl sneaks around for a closer look.)
[Bridge]
KIM: The energy barriers coming down.
JANEWAY: I thought you were still reconfiguring the torpedo.
TUVOK: I am. Its being deactivated from the inside.
JANEWAY: Harry, scan for lifesigns.
KIM: Aye, Captain.
[Rocky Rise]
(The girl comes forward to touch the shuttle debris whilst wearing one of the magnetic stone bracelets.)
SEVEN: Take it off!
(The girl gets zapped.)
[Bridge]
KIM: Im only reading one comm. badge. Its Sevens.
JANEWAY: Open a channel. Janeway to Seven.
[Rocky Rise]
JANEWAY [OC]: Are you and Chakotay all right?
SEVEN: Yes, Captain.
JANEWAY [OC]: Stand by for transport.
SEVEN: Lock on to Commander Chakotay. I need more time.
JANEWAY [OC]: Is there a problem?
SEVEN: Someones been injured. She requires medical attention.
JANEWAY [OC]: Do you need the Doctor?
SEVEN: I believe I can treat her. A medkit would be useful.
JANEWAY [OC]: Acknowledged.
Captain's log, supplemental. Seven has remained on the surface to tend to the injured Ventu girl, while Chakotay is being treated in Sickbay.
[Sickbay]
EMH: The poultice healed the fracture and the infection. Im impressed.
CHAKOTAY: Theyre impressive people. I just hope we havent traumatised them.
JANEWAY: You did what you had to do to get out of there.
CHAKOTAY: Still, I think we transport all the shuttle debris back to Voyager as soon as possible.
JANEWAY: Agreed.
[Cave]
(The girl wakes up.)
SEVEN: Would you like some breakfast? Im not hungry either.
(The girl touches the metal on Seven's hand.)
SEVEN: I admire your curiosity, but you should be more careful. Its time for me to leave.
(Seven gestures goodbye, the girl replies where?)
SEVEN: Back to my home.
(The girl offers her the blanket.)
SEVEN: Thats very kind, but I have no use for it. I supposed I should respect your customs. Thank you.
BARUS [OC]: These botanical specimens indicate a high level of serum nitrates.
[Clearing]
BARUS: Catalogue those foliates.
SEVEN: Explain your presence here.
BARUS: Oh. You must be from Voyager.
SEVEN: Who are you?
BARUS:: My name is Barus. Im the expedition leader.
SEVEN: What kind of expedition are you leading?
BARUS: Were conducting scans to evaluate the potential of this habitat.
SEVEN: Potential for what?
BARUS: Anthropological research, resource development. Weve been waiting years for this.
SEVEN: What about the people who live here?
BARUS: Well help them, of course.
SEVEN: How?
BARUS: With medicine, infrastructure, education. Whoever lowered this barrier did the Ventu a great favour.
[Ready room]
CHAKOTAY: That barrier has to go back up.
SEVEN: Isnt it possible the Ledosians will improve the lives of the Ventu?
CHAKOTAY: Improve them? How?
SEVEN: Theyre intelligent people. Exposure to education and technology may give them better opportunities.
CHAKOTAY: Can you honestly say that you know whats better for them?
SEVEN: No, I cant.
JANEWAY: Then what do you think we should do?
SEVEN: Im uncertain.
JANEWAY: Its not like you to be on the fence.
SEVEN: When Commander Chakotay and I first encountered the Ventu, I found them primitive, of little interest to me. But as I spent time with them, I came to realise that theyre a resourceful, self-reliant people. Their isolation may limit their potential, but if that isolation ends, so will a unique way of life.
[Bridge]
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We appreciate your help in opening this territory to exploration, Captain. Its an unprecedented opportunity.
JANEWAY: A short-lived opportunity, Im afraid.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I dont understand.
JANEWAY: After I transport our deflector back to Voyager, the energy barrier will go back up.
TUVOK: Naturally, youll want to get your people out, so they wont be trapped inside as ours were.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: You have no right to limit our access to our own territory.
JANEWAY: Im not trying to do that, but we have a strict policy about leaving our technology in the hands of other cultures. It often has damaging consequences.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I dont think you realise how important this is. Its not only the resources that interest us. The Ventu are our evolutionary ancestors. Our living history.
JANEWAY: I understand this is disappointing for you, but Im afraid I have no choice.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: In the spirit of cooperation, I hope you'll reconsider.
JANEWAY: Were eager to resume course. Would an hour be enough time to evacuate your people?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Ill make the arrangements.
(Later -_
KIM: Weve transported all the remaining debris to the Cargo Bay.
SEVEN: I have a lock on the deflector assembly.
JANEWAY: What is it?
TUVOK: Theres a Ledosian vessel on an intercept course. Its charging weapons.
JANEWAY: Shields!
TUVOK: Direct hit to the transporters. Theyre offline.
JANEWAY: Get a weapons lock and hail them.
KIM: Theyre hailing us.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Captain Janeway.
JANEWAY: What's going on?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Our government has decided not to let you restore the barrier.
JANEWAY: And that justifies an unprovoked attack?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We only targeted your transporters to avoid harming your crew. I hope youll show the same restraint.
JANEWAY: I dont find weapons fire of any kind restrained.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: If you want to avoid further conflict, I suggest you leave.
(Transmission ends.)
JANEWAY: Take us out of orbit.
CHAKOTAY: What about the deflector?
JANEWAY: Is Tom still in the Flyer?
KIM: Yes, maam.
JANEWAY: Hail him.
[Delta Flyer]
KLEG: Excellent, Mister Paris. Now, come about slowly.
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Paris. Respond.
KLEG: Captain, Id appreciate it if you didnt interrupt my student during his examination.
JANEWAY [OC]: Im sorry
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: But somethings come up.
PARIS: [OC]: What is it, Captain?
JANEWAY: Tom, Im sending you some encrypted orders.
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: Yes, maam.
KLEG: This is highly irregular.
(Paris does a ninety degree turn on the y axis.)
KLEG: Youre going much too fast.
PARIS: Yes, sir. Im in a bit of a hurry.
KLEG: If you have any desire to pass this test, you will reduce your speed immediately.
PARIS: I wish I could do that, sir. I really do.
(The Ledosian ship fires at them.)
KLEG: What was that?
PARIS: Paris to Voyager.
[Bridge]
PARIS [OC]: I'm under attack.
JANEWAY: Give him some help, Mister Tuvok.
(Voyager drives off the Ledosian ship.)
[Delta Flyer]
(Paris beams the Ledosian expedition party aboard.)
BARUS: What have you done?
PARIS: We had to get you out of there before we close the barrier.
BARUS: You can't do that.
(He walks into a forcefield.)
PARIS: Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Paris to Voyager. I've got them.
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Find the deflector.
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: I'm getting a lock on it now.
(Whumph!)
PARIS: My transporters are offline.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: You'd better get out of there, Tom.
PARIS [OC]: Not yet.
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: I've got an idea.
KLEG: I am sorry to inform you, Mister Paris, but you have failed this examination. You will no longer be allowed to operate a vessel within Ledosian space.
PARIS: Something tells me that's not going to be a problem.
(The Flyer swoops down through the atmosphere, phasers the deflector into molecules and gets out just as the barrier closes behind it.)
[Cargo bay]
CHAKOTAY: This is a beautiful blanket.
SEVEN: Take it if you'd like. I don't need it.
CHAKOTAY: If environmental systems ever go down, you might get cold. You know, I
SEVEN: I'd like to
CHAKOTAY: You first.
SEVEN: Please, continue.
CHAKOTAY: In all the excitement, I never apologised.
SEVEN: For what?
CHAKOTAY: Causing you to miss that conference.
SEVEN: As a matter of fact, I wanted to thank you for that.
CHAKOTAY: I thought you were angry.
SEVEN: I was, but you were right. Warp Mechanics can be studied any time. The Ventu, on the other hand.
CHAKOTAY: Something's still bothering you?
SEVEN: I'm concerned for their well-being.
CHAKOTAY: They know how to take care of themselves.
SEVEN: That's not what I mean. Members of the Ledosian expedition had the opportunity to scan my deflector modifications. In time, they may find a way to duplicate our technology and remove the barrier themselves.
CHAKOTAY: I supposed it's possible.
SEVEN: If I'd never made those modifications
CHAKOTAY: We might still be stranded there. I don't know about you, but I'm glad to be back on Voyager.
SEVEN: As am I.
