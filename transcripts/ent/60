   Twilight
   Original Airdate: 5 Nov, 2003

   [Archer's quarters]

   (Archer is woken by jolts.)
   ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
   (He goes into the corridor)
   GUARD: Im sorry sir. Ive orders to keep you here.
   ARCHER: Orders? From whom?
   GUARD: The Captain.
   (There's another jolt, then Archer hits him.)

   [Bridge]

   REED: Were losing forward hull plating!
   (T'Pol is in Starfleet uniform.)
   T'POL: Target their engines.
   REED: No effect.
   ARCHER: What the hells going on?
   T'POL: Someone take him back to his quarters!
   (Two crewmen grab him.)
   REED: Weapons are offline.
   HOSHI: Captain!
   (Everyone stares in horror at the viewscreen, as the Xindi weapon blasts Earth into tiny pieces.)

   [Archer and T'Pol's home]

   (Archer wakes in a light, airy room. His hair is shot through with grey. He goes through to the kitchen where T'Pol is pouring orange juice.)
   ARCHER: Hello?
   T'POL: Youre up early.
   ARCHER: TPol?
   T'POL: I know this all seems unfamiliar. I promise Ill explain everything. Why dont you sit down. Breakfast is almost ready.
   ARCHER: Where are we?
   T'POL: Jonathan, please, sit down. Ill answer all of your questions. Today is a very important day. I have a great deal to tell you. Whats the last thing you remember?
   ARCHER: I was in the Command centre looking at long range scans.
   T'POL: Do you remember what happened after you left the Command centre?
   ARCHER: We were in a corridor. You and I, on our way to the Bridge.
   T'POL: This will be difficult for you to accept, but that was twelve years ago.

   [Corridor]

   ARCHER: You coming tonight?
   T'POL: I hadnt planned on it.
   ARCHER: I can make movie night mandatory for senior officers. Youll enjoy it. Rosemarys Baby, itll scare the hell out of you.
   (The ship shudders.)
   ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. Report.

   [Bridge]

   REED: Theres a power surge in the starboard nacelle. It seems to have been caused by an anomaly.
   ARCHER [OC]: Take us out of warp.
   TRAVIS: The helms not responding. The starboard injectors are fused.
   HOSHI: Im reading more anomalies ahead.
   REED: After course. Twenty degrees to port.

   [Corridor]

   (An anomaly rips alone the corridor. They run to a junction but bulkheads blow out and T'Pol's foot is trapped by debris. Archer tries to free her.)
   T'POL: You have to get out of here!
   ARCHER: Im not leaving you.
   (Another anomaly comes down the corridor, throwing him back and rippling through him.)

   [Sickbay]

   PHLOX: How do you feel?
   ARCHER: Like a shuttle pod landed on my head. Was anyone else hurt?
   PHLOX: No. Captain, there are a few questions I have to ask you.
   ARCHER: Well, it'll have to wait. I want to get to the Bridge.
   (He gets up and fetches his uniform.)
   PHLOX: Im afraid I have to insist. When did you last speak to Commander Tucker?
   ARCHER: This morning, staff briefing. Why? Whats going on, Phlox?
   PHLOX: The anomaly in the corridor left something behind. Weve never seen it before. This is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus. Youve been infected by several clusters of parasites. They havent caused any tissue damage but theyre impairing certain synaptic functions. Theyre preventing you from forming new long term memories.
   ARCHER: Long term.
   PHLOX: You can recall events that happened before the infection, but everything after fades within a few hours. Captain, youve been in Sickbay for the past three days. You last spoke to Commander Tucker about seven hours ago. He came to see you, right here.
   ARCHER: You cant remove these parasites?
   PHLOX: So far, they havent responded to any traditional therapies, but Im synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. You can be assured I wont stop working on this until I find a cure.
   T'POL [OC]: The doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next several weeks. Commander Tucker and I did our best to keep you updated each day on the progress of our mission.

   [Captain's mess]

   TUCKER: It looked like we had a lead on that Xindi ship, the one we planted that tracking devise on, but it turned out to be a garbage scow.
   T'POL: They were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic signature.
   ARCHER: I had an idea this morning, after you told me what happened. I came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers. We can travel farther on less fuel. Let me guess. I already gave you these specs.
   TUCKER: A week ago, but your upgrades are working nicely. Well, I should get back to Engineering. See you both later.
   (Tucker leaves.)
   ARCHER: I imagine that must happen often. Maybe these daily briefings arent such a good idea. Looks like its just a waste of your time, and Trips.
   T'POL: I disagree. We both rely on your experience. You can still contribute to the success of this mission.
   ARCHER: Im sure you have work to do. Ill be in my quarters.
   T'POL: In the corridor, when the anomaly hit, I urged you to leave me behind. If you had, its likely Id be the one suffering from this condition.
   ARCHER: Fortunately, I dont take orders from you.
   T'POL: Captain, I never expressed my gratitude for what you did.
   ARCHER: I suppose theres not much point in thanking me. A few hours from now I wont remember.

   [Corridor]

   HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to TPol.
   T'POL: Go ahead.
   HOSHI [OC]: Were receiving a haul through the subspace buoy. Its Starfleet.
   T'POL: Im on my way.
   T'POL [OC]: This was not a conversation I was looking forward to.

   [Archer and T'Pol's home]

   T'POL: It was Admiral Forrest. The Command Council had reviewed the Doctors report on your condition. They relieved you of duty and granted me a field commission.
   ARCHER: Forrest made you Captain. I suppose congratulations are in order, even if they are belated. I guess these parasites werent so easy to remove after all.
   T'POL: Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside normal space-time. They exist in a state of interspatial flux. None of his treatments had any effect on them.
   ARCHER: What about the mission? Did you find the Xindi weapon?
   T'POL: After several months of searching, we learned where the weapon was being constructed, but the Xindi knew we were getting close. They dispatched two vessels to intercept us.

   [Bridge]

   (Two reptilian ships are attacking Enterprise. Travis is injured - or dead)
   REED: That last one took out warp engines.
   HOSHI: Theyre locking on to the starboard docking port.
   T'POL: Send security teams.
   (The Reptilians are looking for Archer. One finds his quarters and kills his guard then goes in, but Archer puts up a good fight and eventually stabs him through the chest with a statuette.)
   HOSHI: Im reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E.
   T'POL: Have your men set up a defence perimeter on B deck.
   REED: Weve lost weapons.
   T'POL: Is their ship still docked with us?
   REED: It is.
   (T'Pol steers Enterprise so that the docked ship smashes into the other Xindi vessel and breaks up. The starboard nacelle is damaged too.)
   REED: Both ships are disabled.

   [Situation room]

   PHLOX: Weve lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical.
   T'POL: The Xindi?
   REED: Weve taken nine prisoners but the Brig was only designed for two. Im not sure what to do with the others.
   TUCKER: Blow them out the airlock.
   T'POL: Put them in crew quarters under heavy guard. How are the repairs coming?
   TUCKER: We should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of hours. The warp drive's another question. The starboard nacelles a lost cause, half the coils have been fused.
   T'POL: How long to repair them?
   TUCKER: If we were at Jupiter station, three weeks. Out here Id have to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch. Six months minimum. For now the best I can give you is a warp one point seven.
   REED: Were not going to get very far at that speed.
   T'POL: Resume our previous heading. Dismissed.
   (The others leave.)
   TUCKER: How can we keep going with one warp engine?
   T'POL: Theres no option.
   TUCKER: What the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship?
   T'POL: I chose the logical course of action.
   TUCKER: Since the Captain got sick, this missions taken one wrong turn after another.
   T'POL: If you believe Ive acted improperly, I suggest you contact Admiral Forrest.

   [Archer and T'Pol's home]

   ARCHER: You said we eventually found the weapon. How could we manage that without warp engines?
   T'POL: We located the facility where the Xindi constructed the probe, but it had already been deployed.
   ARCHER: Earth?
   T'POL: Destroyed. They didnt stop at your homeworld. They attacked every human outpost they could find. Mars, Alpha Centauri, Vega colony, all were destroyed.
   ARCHER: How many of us are left?
   T'POL: Less than six thousand.

   [Outside]

   (A small village of curved roofed metal houses.)
   T'POL: Were on the fifth planet in the Ceti Alpha system. Its far from the Expanse.
   ARCHER: What happened to the crew?
   T'POL: Most of them are still aboard the ship. Its in orbit, patrolling this system.
   ARCHER: How did all these people get here?
   T'POL: Survivors from human colonies realised they needed a place to take refuge. Several convoys headed for this system. One of them was lead by Enterprise.

   [Bridge]

   REED: Theres a ship approaching at high warp. Its Vulcan.
   HOSHI: Theyre hailing us.
   T'POL: Ambassador.
   SOVAL [on viewscreen]: I need to speak with you, TPol.

   [Ready room]

   T'POL: Come in
   SOVAL: That uniform doesnt suit you, Captain.
   T'POL: I doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire.
   SOVAL: I want you to return with me to Vulcan.
   T'POL: I'm no longer under your authority.
   SOVAL: Its not an order, its a request for your own safety. Two weeks ago, the High Command received a distress call from the Earth convoy in the Mutara system. By the time our ships reached them, they found nothing but a field of debris. The weapon signatures were Xindi. Even if your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha, its most likely youll find an armada waiting for you.
   T'POL: Were prepared to confront them.
   SOVAL: It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise. It forced you to make an impulsive decision. If you return with me now, the High Command is prepared to reinstate your rank.
   T'POL: I wont leave them.
   SOVAL: Them or him? There are specialists on Vulcan that can help Archer.
   T'POL: Youd take him as well?
   SOVAL: If you return to Vulcan. You owe the humans nothing. They chose to leave Earth before they were ready. If theyd accepted our counsel, this tragedy would have been avoided.
   T'POL: We could have saved them.
   SOVAL: How?
   T'POL: We held back their warp programme for one hundred years. A policy which you supported. If we would have helped them develop faster ships, better defences.
   SOVAL: Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic. Well be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider.

   [Archer's quarters]

   ARCHER: Come in. Did things go well with the Vulcans?
   T'POL: How did you know that they were?
   ARCHER: There was obviously a reason I chose these quarters. You can see a lot from this window. What did they want?
   T'POL: They were here to replenish our supplies.
   ARCHER: Ha. Ive been thinking about everything you told me. I realise Im not fit to command the ship, but theres got to be some way I can help. I could give Trip a hand in Engineering.
   T'POL: We tried something similar to that a few months ago. It was uncomfortable for you.
   ARCHER: So Im supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day?
   T'POL: You often take Porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on D deck. The children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions.
   ARCHER: In other words, just stay out of the way.
   T'POL [OC]: After nearly a year, we arrived in this system. Our convey was the only one to reach it. The others had all been attacked and destroyed.

   [Ready room]

   TUCKER: This planet's barely Minshara-class. Maybe we shouldve picked one with a little more blue and green on it. Id like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony sites.
   T'POL: You're needed on Enterprise. The civilian leaders are going to want to meet with you.
   TUCKER: Me? Youre the one they deal with.
   T'POL: Im resigning my commission.
   TUCKER: Youre sure you want to do this?
   T'POL: Captain Archer will be better off on the surface with the others. Hell need a caretaker, someone he trusts. I cant be in two places at the same time.
   TUCKER: Youre making one hell of a sacrifice. Why?
   T'POL: I have my reasons.

   [Archer and T'Pol's home]

   T'POL: The civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw materials. We used them to construct the settlement. At this point, you often wonder if youre a victim of some elaborate deception.
   ARCHER: The thought did cross my mind.
   T'POL: Margaret Mullin. You met her when you were twenty four years old, during flight school in San Francisco. The night before you graduated, you asked her to marry you, outside of her apartment on Westgate Avenue. She turned you down. She said she didnt want to become a Starfleet widow.
   ARCHER: How the hell did you know that?
   T'POL: Our relationship has evolved over the years.
   ARCHER: Exactly how far has it evolved? (Later, Phlox has arrived. His hair is longer, but that's all.)
   PHLOX: Nothing seems to have changed since your last exam.
   ARCHER: Is this why you came all the way from Denobula, to give me a check-up?
   PHLOX: You didnt tell him? After this settlement was established, it became clear that I was never going to find a treatment for your condition if I remained here, so I returned home and consulted with some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula. My colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short of vaporising you in a subspace implosion. They assured me the technology to do what was required did not exist, and they were correct. It took almost a decade to develop, but now Im ready to put it to the test. The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy, levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered starship.
   T'POL: Were going to Enterprise.

   [Docking hatch]

   (They are piped on board in traditional Naval fashion. Tucker has gone grey, too.)
   TUCKER: Its good to see you sir.
   ARCHER: Captain Tucker. I dont think you need to call me sir anymore.
   TUCKER: Old habits. I apologise for the low lighting. Were running on reserve power. Antimatters at a premium these days.
   ARCHER: How long has it been since you took command?
   TUCKER: Nine years. Ive got some people whod like to say hello.
   (Reed has grown a beard.)
   REED: You're looking well, sir.
   ARCHER: Thank you, Commander is it?
   REED: Actually, Ive been promoted to Captain.
   TUCKER: Malcolms taking over the Intrepid from Ramirez.
   ARCHER: Did everyone get their own ship while I was gone?
   HOSHI: Not everyone, sir.
   ARCHER: Hoshi.
   (They hug.)
   TUCKER: Theres a reception in the Mess hall if youre feeling up to it.
   PHLOX: A visit to Engineering may be in order first.

   [Engineering]

   PHLOX: Ill be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate the parasites. Well start with this cluster today.
   ARCHER: Why not remove all of them at once?
   PHLOX: This procedures never been attempted before. We should move cautiously.
   T'POL: When can you begin?
   PHLOX: The emitters should be calibrated within the hour.

   [Archer's quarters]

   ARCHER: Come in.
   T'POL: You left the reception early.
   ARCHER: It was a little disturbing. From my perspective, I saw most of those people just a few hours ago. It couldnt have been easy for you, telling me the same story over and over again for twelve years.
   T'POL: I dont always tell it in detail.
   ARCHER: I hope Ive told you before, but, Im very grateful for everything youve done for me. If this works
   PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
   ARCHER: Go ahead
   PHLOX [OC]: Were ready.

   [Bridge]

   REED: Im picking up an intermittent duranium signature.
   TUCKER: Is it a ship?
   REED: Im not certain. Its in a close orbit around the sun.
   TUCKER: Weve better check it out. Lay in a course.

   [Engineering]

   (Archer is lying in a perspex tube, with a couple of green lights flashing above his forehead.)
   PHLOX: Increase to eight hundred millicochranes.
   (The engineer at the warp controls presses buttons.)
   PHLOX: Increase to eight fifty.
   (A bunch of parasites vanish from the monitor, and they help Archer up.)

   [Bridge]

   REED: Theres a small vessel just outside the chromosphere.
   TUCKER: Is it Xindi?
   REED: The hull configuration doesnt match. Theres one biosign on board.
   TUCKER: Open up a channel. This is Captain Charles Tucker. Is there something we can help you with?
   HOSHI: Hes moving.
   TUCKER: Follow him.
   REED: His warp coils are charging.
   TUCKER: Target one of his nacelles.
   (Three shots later, the little ship is disabled.)
   TUCKER: Bring it into the Launch bay.

   [Sickbay]

   PHLOX: Just as my simulations predicted. Theres no trace of the parasites I targeted. Well, I understand I may have a passenger on my voyage home.
   T'POL: Im remaining at the settlement for the time being. He may need my help during his recovery.
   PHLOX: Have you told the Captain how you feel about him? Its obvious youve become quite attached. Its nothing to be ashamed of. Vulcans experience the same emotions as any other species. Theyre simply better at hiding them.
   T'POL: Im not hiding anything. He risked his life to save me. Im merely repaying a debt.
   PHLOX: I can only imagine what it must have been like. Spending all those years in that house, learning so much about him, yet he remembers nothing about you beyond the day he became ill. If were successful, perhaps things will be different.
   T'POL: Theres a discrepancy in these scans.
   PHLOX: What is it?

   [Brig]

   YEDRIN: (a Yridian) I deal in Rigelian flamegems. I was waiting for a prospective buyer when you attacked me.
   TUCKER: You picked an odd place for a business transaction.
   REED: We searched your ship. We didnt find any cargo.
   YEDRIN: Thats because I jettisoned it all. I thought you where going to arrest me. Flamegems are illegal in this region.
   REED: We found your species in our Vulcan database. It appears Yridians are information dealers.
   TUCKER: Who hired you? Was it the Xindi?
   YEDRIN: Xindi?
   TUCKER: Maybe we didnt give his vessel a close enough look. Go back to the launch bay, use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat little pieces. Keep at it until you find some evidence that supports his story.
   YEDRIN: Youre going to destroy my ship? Its not you they want. Its the Denobulan.
   REED: Phlox?
   YEDRIN: I was hired to follow him.
   TUCKER: Hired by who?
   YEDRIN: I dont know, they work through intermediaries. I was paid to follow the Denobulan if he ever left his home world.
   TUCKER: What did you tell them? Answer me.

   [Sickbay]

   TUCKER: Whats the problem?
   PHLOX: Your engineers wont let us continue with the Captains treatment.
   TUCKER: Those are my orders. Look, Id do anything to help the Captain, but weve got bigger problems at the moment.
   PHLOX: This maybe the only solution to your problems, Captain.
   T'POL: Destroying these parasites is most likely the key to saving humanity, and Earth.
   TUCKER: Earths gone.
   PHLOX: This image was taken a few minutes ago. You can see the region where I eradicated the first cluster of parasites. Its gone in this image, as well.
   TUCKER: Doc.
   PHLOX: This scan was taken over twelve years ago. The cluster has disappeared from all the scans Ive taken over the last twelve years. It's as if it never existed at all
   T'POL: By destroying the organisms in the present, we appear to have neutralised them in the past.
   PHLOX: We know theyre from another spatial domain. Apparently, they also exist outside of time. If we can eliminate all of the parasites, its possible the Captains infection will never have occurred.
   T'POL: History may be altered. Captain Archer will have remained in command of Enterprise. Our mission in the Expanse could have an entirely different outcome.
   PHLOX: We only have to divert power for a few hours. I am certain I can complete the procedure in that time.
   TUCKER: Im sorry. We need all the power weve got for the weapons.
   T'POL: If the Xindi are on their way theres very little we can do to stop them..
   TUCKER: Well, we cant just run up the white flag.
   HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Tucker. You'd better get up here, sir.
   TUCKER: Im on my way. We'll talk about this later.

   [Bridge]

   HOSHI: I'm getting a signal from one of our sentry probes. Six Xindi ships have entered the system.
   TUCKER: Charge the phase cannons. Is everyone in position?
   HOSHI: Aye, sir.
   REED: The Xindi ships are in range.
   TUCKER: Fire!
   REED: Our shields are holding. Nice to know they work in combat.
   TUCKER: Remind me to send a note to General Shran. Adjust your heading. Three one oh mark two seven. Full impulse.
   HOSHI: Two of their ships are breaking off. Theyre following us.
   TUCKER: What about the others?
   HOSHI: Still heading towards the planet.
   (As Enterprise leads the two ships off, two more appear at the rear and attack the intruders.)
   REED: The Insectoid ship's been damaged. Theyre losing power.
   TUCKER: Target the second one.
   REED: Their engine's disabled.
   HOSHI: The other Xindi ships have changed their heading.
   TUCKER: I think were going to find out how much of a beating these new shields can take.

   [Sickbay]

   ARCHER: TPol, whats happening?
   T'POL: Jonathan, you need to rest. Where are you going?
   ARCHER: To the Bridge. Im not going to just lie here while they destroy whats left of humanity.
   TPOL: (to Phlox) You should remain here.

   [Bridge]

   (Enterprise is taking a beating.)
   REED: Forward shieldings at fifty two percent.

   [Corridor]

   ARCHER: Turbolifts are down.
   (He and T'Pol use the Jefferies tubes.)

   [Bridge]

   HOSHI: Intrepids taken a direct hit. Theyve lost their port nacelle.
   TUCKER: Tell them to withdraw.
   REED: Our phase cannons are down. Our forward shield's collapsing!
   HOSHI: Hull breaches on B deck, C deck!
   REED: Theyre targeting the Bridge!
   TUCKER: Hard to port!
   (The top of the ship is blown off.)

   [Corridor]

   (They come out of the tube to a status panel.)
   ARCHER: The Bridge is gone.
   T'POL: TPol to Phlox.
   PHLOX [OC]: Go ahead.
   T'POL: Meet us in Engineering. Were going to finish the procedure.
   PHLOX [OC]: Understood.
   ARCHER: We dont have time to worry about parasites right now.
   T'POL: Thats not necessarily true. Come with me. I'll explain.
   (Meanwhile, Xindi reptilians are beaming aboard and massacring the crew.)

   [Engineering]

   PHLOX: Im sorry, Captain. The chambers been damaged.
   ARCHER: Didnt you say that we could destroy the parasites with a subspace implosion?
   T'POL: Yes, but then we
   ARCHER: Can we create one?
   T'POL: We would have to overload three plasma injectors. That would send a feedback pulse through the reactor.
   PHLOX: You'll destroy the ship?
   ARCHER: At this point, it wont make much of a difference. You two get to a shuttlepod. Theyre only after humans. If this doesnt work out youll still have a chance. Thats an order.
   (T'Pol joins him at the controls.)
   T'POL: With all due respect, you were relieved of command.
   ARCHER: One of the plasma injectors was damaged. We'll have to replace it. Theyre in supply locker C on the upper level.
   (Phlox goes to get it while MACOs try to hold off the reptilians.)
   ARCHER: Were back in business.
   (Xindi get into Engineering. Phlox kills one but the other gets him and he falls from the upper level.)
   ARCHER: Phlox! Phlox?
   (Archer returns fire.)
   ARCHER: How much longer?
   T'POL: Stand by.
   (She's also hit, but Archer enters the code before he gets shot as well. He pushes the final lever with his dying breath and the ship explodes very spectacularly.)

   [Sickbay]

   PHLOX: How do you feel?
   ARCHER: Like a shuttlepod landed on my head. Whats our status?
   T'POL: Weve cleared the anomalies. There is minor damage to the starboard nacelle. Repairs should be complete within an hour.
   PHLOX: You suffered a mild concussion. Id like to keep you overnight for observation.
   ARCHER: All right, Doctor.
   (Phlox leaves them.)
   T'POL: You could have been seriously injured. I told you to leave me behind.
   ARCHER: Fortunately, I dont take orders from you.
   T'POL: I believe you wanted to see this.
   ARCHER: Rosemarys Baby?
   T'POL: You were obviously looking forward to it, and since youre not going to be able to attend tonight.
   ARCHER: Thanks. Would you mind bringing me another pillow?
   (She does.)
   ARCHER: Would you turn down the lights just a little?
   T'POL: Anything else?
   ARCHER: You know, youd make a wonderful nurse.
