TEASER
EXT--OFFWORLD P3X-116
[SG-1 are running for the gate pursued by two death gliders, which are
bombarding them. They reach the gate and Daniel starts dialling, while
the others are firing at the enemy. The gate kawooshes.]
O'NEILL
(yelling)
Go!
[Daniel runs through the gate, followed by Carter. O'Neill and Teal'c
continue to fire on the gliders, Teal'c is using a massive anti-tank
type cannon. A near miss knocks O'Neill down, Teal'c goes to help him;
as they look up an Alkesh rises from behind woodland. They run for the
gate and O'Neill hurls himself through. Teal'c pauses, turns, and
recognizes Tanith at the controls of the Alkesh. He holds off firing
until the ship moves closer, then fires directly into the cockpit. With
a look of satisfaction he turns and runs into the wormhole. The ship
dives towards the gate, crashes and explodes.]
INT--GATEROOM
[The wormhole disengages leaving O'Neill, Daniel and Carter staring at
it from the bottom of the ramp. Hammond hurries in.]
HAMMOND
Where is Teal'c?
O'NEILL
I don't know, sir. He was right behind me.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond climbs the stairs to the control room followed by O'Neill,
Carter and Daniel. O'Neill is holding a pad to his right temple.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, are you okay?
O'NEILL
We've gotta go back, sir.
[Hammond stands behind Davis, who is manning the computer.]
HAMMOND
What was your situation?
CARTER
We were being pursued by gliders and an Alkesh.
O'NEILL
Teal'c was right with me. He could still be alive.
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Dial P3X-116. We'll try to raise him on his radio.
[Monitor shows a picture of the Stargate spinning.]
DAVIS
Chevron 1 encoded.
CARTER
Sir, we should have a MALP standing by in case we need a visual.
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Do it.
DAVIS
Yes, sir.
[He activates the keys.]
DAVIS
Chevron 2...Sir. we're getting an unknown error. Should I override?
HAMMOND
Major?
CARTER
Gate feedback protocol means the system is detecting something wrong
with the Stargate itself. Not our dialling computer.
DAVIS
Chevron 4 encoded.
DANIEL
Like what?
CARTER
I don't know. It's something our computer isn't recognizing.
[She looks at O'Neill.]
CARTER
Sir, what happened just before you jumped through.?
O'NEILL
The ship was coming right at us
CARTER
You think it could have impacted the Stargate on the other side?
O'NEILL
And if it did?
CARTER
W...I hate to say this but if the wormhole was shut down while
Teal'c was en route...
DAVIS
Chevron 6 encoded...still showing an unknown error, sir.
CARTER
Sir, we'd better abort.
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Abort the dialling procedure.
DAVIS
Dialling sequence aborted.
[The gate spins to a stop.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond is looking at the motionless Stargate, then turns to Daniel.]
HAMMOND
So the Tok'ra intel was right. The Goa'uld were scouting P3X-116 for
a new base.
DANIEL
Looks that way. What the Tok'ra didn't tell us is that the Goa'uld
in question is Tanith. We'd just spotted him on the ground, near his
Alkesh with a small contingent of Jaffa, when the glider made our
position.
HAMMOND
He came after you himself?
DANIEL
Yeah...as you know Teal'c has this kind of thing between
them...so...
[Carter comes up the stairs looking anxious.]
CARTER
Sir, I think I know what the problem is but we have to act quickly.
HAMMOND
What is it?
CARTER
You know how the Stargate turns matter into energy and then
transmits it through a subspace wormhole?
DANIEL
That's gate travel 101.
CARTER
And the gate on the receiving end is what translates the energy
signature and reconverts it back into its original form.
HAMMOND
Major!
CARTER
The Stargate has massive amounts of memory inside it. It's like a
computer buffer. It temporarily restores the energy patterns before
it reconverts them into matter. Now it does this to make sure it has
all the information before it reassembles the object - or in our
case, person.The error we're receiving from the gate seems to
indicate there's still an energy pattern stored in the memory
buffer.
DANIEL
Teal'c?
CARTER
If the Alkesh crashed into the DHD on the other planet it would have
cut off power to the outgoing gate. Then the wormhole would have
been severed prematurely. Now if that happened before our gate was
able to reconvert Teal'c's energy signature back into matter...
HAMMOND
Teal'c is in our Stargate?
CARTER
His energy signature, yes. Stored in the memory.
DANIEL
Well, let's get him out.
CARTER
Right now..I..I'm not sure how...that's not the worst problem.
DANIEL
There's worse?
CARTER
The Stargate has various safety protocols designed to prevent
different energy signatures mixing together. and it does this by
erasing a memory buffer anytime any wormhole is established. It's
like an overall system reset. So, if we try dialling out of our gate
or somebody off world tries dialling in ...
HAMMOND
We have eight teams currently on missions.
CARTER
Teal'c's signature will be erased... permanently.
HAMMOND
How do we get our people home?
DANIEL
When the Russians had their DHD connected to their gate it became
the dominant gate on Earth.
CARTER
Exactly. All incoming wormholes automatically went there.
HAMMOND
I'll call the President.
DANIEL
I'll go find out how long we have before the next SG teams are back.

HAMMOND
Yes, sir. We have 8 teams off world we have to get home. It's a
temporary situation we hope to have resolved as quickly as
possible... Thank you, sir, I'll get our best man, for the job, on a
plane right away.
DANIEL
The next team due to check in is SG5. They have a scheduled report
at 1600 hours.
HAMMOND
Less than an hour from now. Will the iris be in place?
DANIEL
They're working as fast as they can.
HAMMOND
The best man I was talking about is you. We need a liaison in Russia
to coordinate our interests. Pack a bag. You leave in half an hour.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is working at the computer. O'Neill approaches. ]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Sir! You Okay?
O'NEILL
Oh, couple of stitches, concussion, nausea, dizziness ... the usual.
Why is Teal'c still in the gate?
CARTER
Well, Sir... it's very complicated.
O'NEILL
Can I help?
CARTER
Well... in order to overcome the lack of a DHD we have to create the
proper interface between the Gate and our computer. We generated a
series of instructions based on electrical impulses to which the
Gate crystals would respond. Now these were found mostly by trial
and error over a great deal of time. What we need to do now is find
a series of impulses which would instruct the Gate to override one
of its primary functions.
O'NEILL
Can I get you some coffee?
CARTER
Sir, the truth is, the Gate may not even be capable of doing what we
need it to do.
O'NEILL
Which is what?
CARTER
Resume a reintegration process which was cut off prematurely.
O'NEILL
Carter! My head!
CARTER
Sir - I'm sorry; but the more I go through this, the more I'm
becoming concerned that we may not even be able to get Teal'c back.
O'NEILL
Oh...

DANIEL

COLONEL
I trust you had a pleasant trip?
DAVIS
As possible under the circumstances.
COLONEL
Yes, yes. An unfortunate problem. Please...
[He waves them to a table. They sit.]
COLONEL
The details made available to me were somewhat vague. Only that a
technical glitch has somehow trapped a member of your team inside
the inner workings of your Stargate.
DANIEL
That's pretty much all we know at the moment.
COLONEL
Then it seem we are not the only ones who are incapable of handing
every situation, the Stargate may present, after all.
DAVIS
What is the current status of our off world teams?
COLONEL
All of them have been contacted successfully. SG-5 and SG-8 have
already arrived safely.
DANIEL
We do appreciate what you're doing.
COLONEL
Despite appearances, our participation in this effort is not one of
good faith, Doctor Jackson. The Russian military is not here to do
your bidding.
DANIEL
I wasn't suggesting you were.
COLONEL
Your Government seems to think it can dictate protocol in all
matters regarding Stargate technology.
DAVIS
Our Governments have a deal.
COLONEL
One which has been blatantly ignored by both sides, wouldn't you
agree?
DAVIS
It is technically and logistically impossible to run concurrent
Stargate programs, Colonel.
COLONEL
By the sounds of it, it may be impossible not to, Major.

HAMMOND
Go home.
O'NEILL
No, I'm all right, sir. Just got five minutes of quality sleep.
HAMMOND
Everything that can be done is being done.
O'NEILL
You know, this wouldn't have happened if he'd just followed orders.
It's that damned Jaffa revenge thing...
HAMMOND
Get some rest, Colonel. That's an order.
[Hammond leaves, and O'Neill puts his head down again.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond comes into the briefing room, surprised to see Colonel
Simmons, Doctor McKay and Major Carter there.]
HAMMOND
Colonel Simmons?
SIMMONS
Hallo, General. I was just introducing Doctor McKay and Major
Carter. The doctor has been studying the Stargate program out of
Area 51 for over a year now.
CARTER
Without access to a working gate?
MCKAY
(smugly)
I had a virtual computer model that was built when the second gate
was there.
HAMMOND
Well I'm sure it's a thrill to be here to see the real thing.
MCKAY
(dismissively)
Hah! Not really.
SIMMONS
The Pentagon feels Doctor McKay has become the foremost expert on
the Stargate.
HAMMOND
Next to Major Carter.
MCKAY
With all due respects, Major. You spend most of your time in the
field.
HAMMOND
(impatiently)
Major Carter spent 2 years working on the gate prior to her 5 years
at the SGC. She's the one that made this program viable.
MCKAY
Actually the interface she designed is full of flaws.
CARTER
Well, I admit it's not perfect but it's certa...
MCKAY
(interrupting rudely)
It has caused numerous unnecessary situations, any of which could
have ended in catastrophe.
SIMMONS
And we certainly don't want that to happen. That's why the doctor's
here to help.
HAMMOND
Good. He can report to Major Carter.
SIMMONS
And the two of them might be able to work together to solve this
problem. To get Teal'c back in one piece. In the time allotted.
CARTER
Excuse me? In the time allotted?
SIMMONS
48 hours.
CARTER
(aghast, to Hammond)
Sir?
HAMMOND
(barely containing his anger)
Come with me,Colonel.

on his desk, as the Colonel throws himself into a chair.]
HAMMOND
(outraged)
I don't know who you are, or who you work for.You do not come into
my facility and dictate procedures to me.
SIMMONS
Oh, General. Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just bringing you your
orders.
HAMMOND
Teal'c is an invaluable asset. Without him you might very well not
be sitting there supposedly representing your country.
SIMMONS
Well, we're aware of his contributions as well as his questionable
allegiances. Now, in this operation we have lost a lot of good
Americans. You're not going to tell me you hold Teal'c's life above
one of our own people, are you?
HAMMOND
Teal'c is one our own people and his life is not lost yet.
SIMMONS
Maybe not. But my sources tell me that all the off world teams are
home safe. Now, the Pentagon is not willing to deal with the
Russians over the long term. And, in the past, you yourself have
made a case for keeping SGC alive and running at all costs. So...
[He gestures to Carter and McKay, through the window.]
SIMMONS
...these people are going to have to come up with a solution in the
next 2 days or you will be ordered to resume sending teams through
the gate.
EXT--RUSSIAN COLONEL'S OFFICE
COLONEL
All of your teams have arrived safely, that is why we agreed to help
you.
DANIEL
Now all we need to do is to send more teams off world, on a sort of
fact finding mission. where our off world allies may know the way to
save Teal'c.
COLONEL
Your off world allies?
DANIEL
Allies of Earth.
COLONEL
(impatiently)
As long as our gate is connected, Doctor Jackson, we, as in 'the
Russian People,'are vulnerable to attack.
DAVIS
We are here to ensure the orders agreed upon by our respective
leaders are carried out. We are not here to negotiate with you,
Colonel.
COLONEL
(ranting)
On the contrary, Major, that is exactly why you're here. The deal,
so unwisely made by our Government ,requires us to cease our
operations of the Stargate. Not make it available to you whenever
you deem it necessary. If you wish to continue to use our technology
you must finally present us with something of significant value in
return.

MAYBOURNE
Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy.

I'm so gonna kick your ass.

Come on. Would I come back here like this if I'd done it?
O'NEILL
You might.
MAYBOURNE
I swear, Jack.
O'NEILL
Well, who did?
MAYBOURNE
I don't know.
O'NEILL
What do you know?
MAYBOURNE
Just what I read in the NID files. That you got shot and the Goa'uld
escaped.
O'NEILL
You came all the way back to Colorado Springs to tell me you didn't
do it?
MAYBOURNE
I didn't think you'd believe me any other way. And I wanted to warn
you.
O'NEILL
About what?
MAYBOURNE
I heard about Teal'c.
O'NEILL
What about him?
MAYBOURNE
I hope you get him back.
O'NEILL
And the warning part?
MAYBOURNE
Watch out for Frank Simmons.
O'NEILL
Simmons again. What is it with you guys?
MAYBOURNE
We go back. I don't know what he's up to but I guarantee it's not
gonna be good for Teal'c or the SGC.
O'NEILL
Great!
MAYBOURNE
I'll be in town for a couple of days. I'd like to see how it turns
out. If you need me I'm at the Accent Inn. I'm checked in under the

MCKAY

CARTER
Doctor.
MCKAY
I guess that we got off on the wrong foot.
CARTER
What probability factor did you use figuring that out?
MCKAY
For the record I don't work for Colonel Simmons.
CARTER
What difference does that make?
MCKAY
Well, I sensed...a little... tension... there. I'm on the Airforce
payroll, I report directly to the Chiefs of Staff.
CARTER
Oh, well. That changes everything.
MCKAY
I just...er...wanted to give you my honest analysis, Major. It is a
waste of time to assume you're right about everything. I just
thought we'd get past that.
CARTER
Leaving more time to devote to your fan club.
MCKAY
The gate wasn't meant to be used without a dialling device. Your
computer system ignores 220 of the 400 feedback signals the gate can
emit during any given dialling sequence. It is a fluke that you
picked up the buffer one, and for that matter, I'm surprised that
you even bothered aborting a dialling sequence, despite the error.
CARTER
What is that supposed to mean?
MCKAY
I've read the reports, Major. You've ignored error data and bypassed
dialling protocols on several occasions to get a lock.
CARTER
My job is to present the risks not decide whether to take them. Now,
if you have something positive to add - do it.Otherwise get out of
my lab.
MCKAY
Well...
[The phone rings and Carter picks it up.]
CARTER

DANIEL
(talking on phone)
Hey, Sam. We've got the Russians to agree to send one team out. SG5
contacted the Tok'ra... they just got back.
CARTER
What did they say?
DANIEL
They said the glitch probably occurred because we didn't have a DHD.
Said a local DHD would compensate for the loss of power and allow
the gate to finish the reintegration process.
CARTER
Well, if the DHD could have prevented the problem maybe the DHD can
also fix it. Is there any chance we can get the Russians to give us
their DHD?
COLONEL
(shakes his head at Davis)
That is impossible at the moment.
DANIEL
Not without giving back Alaska.
CARTER
That bad, huh?
DANIEL
Yeah! Besides the Tok'ra warned us that connecting a DHD might not
be the way to get Teal'c out of the memory.
CARTER
It could impose the reset protocol the same as dialling in would.
DANIEL
Yup!
CARTER
So, how do the Tok'ra suggest we fix the problem?
DANIEL
They don't know. They said they'd work on it, but they didn't say
how long that might take. Sorry I don't have better news.
CARTER
Yeah. Me too. Thanks Daniel.

SIMMONS
Clock's ticking. You have less than 32 hours.
HAMMOND
You didn't close the door just to tell me that, did you, Colonel?
SIMMONS
The way I see it, General, despite their combined brain powers,
Major Carter and Doctor McKay are not going to solve this problem in
the time allotted.
HAMMOND
I'm working on extending that. Why are you really here, Colonel?
SIMMONS
I can provide you with the information you're going to need to save
Teal'c.
HAMMOND
How?
SIMMONS
That's not important.
HAMMOND
It damned well is.
SIMMONS
What's important is that this information is not going to be for
free.
HAMMOND
Are you speaking officially on behalf of the NID? Because I can't
believe what I'm hearing.
SIMMONS
Oh, just stick to the point, General.
HAMMOND
I'm trying to count just how many crimes you are committing right
now, Colonel.
SIMMONS
General, the way I see it you have two options. You can either give
me what I want, a small token compared to what's at stake, at least
for you. Or I guess you can pick up the phone and call your
superiors and repeat this conversation. At which point I will deny
everything.
HAMMOND
I'm thinking of having you arrested this instant.
SIMMONS
Oh, you go ahead. But I guarantee you'll never see Teal'c again.

wanted for treason. It'd be my pleasure.
O'NEILL
Okay. I'll just pretend you didn't say that.

Hammond's office and blackmailed him right to his face?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
MAYBOURNE
Hah. God, I admire that. What'd he ask for?
O'NEILL
A Goa'uld hand device.
MAYBOURNE

[Davis is reading a list.]
DAVIS
This is unacceptable.
COLONEL
We allowed all of your teams to return home safely. We even allowed
you to send out another team, on a new reconnaissance mission. We
expect nothing less than everything on that list in return.
DAVIS
Your government agreed to allow us to use your gate, period. It
mentioned nothing about any demands.
COLONEL
(ranting)
Russia will not stand by and allow you to operate your program
without our direct involvement.We demand that a Russian team be
permanently stationed at your base. That all mission files should go
to our onsite officer. And that all technologies procured and
developed as a result of Stargate travel - past, present and future
- will be shared equally.
DAVIS
Or what? We already know your government has no interest in running
it's own program.
COLONEL
Political winds change, Major. And don't forget, with the DHD we can
ensure that our base has the dominant operational gate.
DAVIS
You do realize, Sir! that what you're talking about could be
interpreted as an act of war?
COLONEL
Don't be ridiculous. How can the United States go to war over
something their people know nothing about.
DAVIS
It wouldn't be unprecedented, Colonel.
DANIEL
What would it take to give us your DHD?
COLONEL
Hah.
DANIEL
Oh, seriously. Let's put it on the table. I mean, we all know you
think of the DHD as your long term bargaining chip. But everything
has a price and no-one has said exactly what it would take to buy
you out, right now.
DAVIS
Doctor Jackson...
COLONEL
Oh, he has a good point, Major. The problem is,Doctor Jackson, that
without full disclosure of technologies already procured by the SGC
it may be impossible to determine a reasonable price.
INT--MAYBOURNE'S APARTMENT
[Maybourne is sitting at a computer, surfing files. O'Neill is

O'NEILL
Didn't the NID track you down last time you did this?
MAYBOURNE
Oh, I'm using a link that's bouncing off five different satellites.
Tracing this will make them dizzy for a month.
O'NEILL
What are you looking for?
MAYBOURNE
The NID have several bases, for the Special Ops, throughout the
country.
O'NEILL
Legitimate organizations?
MAYBOURNE
It's the only way we're gonna find the Goa'uld, Jack.
MAYBOURNE
What do you mean?
MAYBOURNE
Through legitimate NID operations. Unofficial business can be
financed in the private sector and can be kept of the books.But any
official NID action has to be filed by the Pentagon, same as any
branch of the military. If Simmons used an NID plane to visit our
snakehead then the flight plan was registered.
O'NEILL
Wouldn't that be stupid.
MAYBOURNE
The situation with Teal'c provided Simmons with a unique opportunity
but the Pentagon's deadline didn't give him much time. Besides the
NID flight plans are classified information. And there aren't many
people who would know the current locations of every NID safehouse
in the country. You just happen to be lucky enough to know one of
the people who does.

[McKay and Carter are selecting food at buffet counter.]
MCKAY
There's no switch. The crystals are wiped clean by an unstable
vortex of a forming wormhole. Any idea how much excess energy one of
those blasts give off?
CARTER
As a matter of fact, I do. Now what we need to do is find a way to
establishing an event horizon without the vortex.
MCKAY
'S impossible.
CARTER
I've seen it done before.
MCKAY
Not by magical fairy beans...
(to the server)
Is there lemon on the chicken?
SERVER
It's lemon chicken.
MCKAY
Huh! So it is. I'm mortally allergic to citrus. One drop of lemon
and I could die. I'll have whatever that is.
(to Carter)
Gotta be very careful.
[They sit at a table where McKay starts wolfing his food.]
MCKAY
So what would this fictional event horizon be connected to?
[Carter watches him eat.]
CARTER
(sarcastically)
Hungry?
MCKAY
Starving! Shockingly this is even worse than it looks. It beats a
hypoglycaemic reaction.
CARTER
The event horizon is what dematerializes you and sends you into the
wormhole. And maybe we don't need to connect to a wormhole to form
an event horizon.
MCKAY
Maybe. Somehow. Somewhere.
CARTER
All we need to do is get the rematerialization process to work.
MCKAY
Major, even if you managed to create a viable event horizon without
connecting to a wormhole, you'd never get the gate to reintegrate
Teal'c.
CARTER
Why not?
MCKAY
The crystals that retain the energy pattern before reintegration are
not like magnetic hard drives.
CARTER
I know, they're crystals.
MCKAY
But you can't just ignore the laws of thermodynamics. Entropy
dictates that the crystals won't retain their energy patterns
permanently. I've measured it. It's what's called quantitative
evidence.
CARTER
I think the energy itself is unimportant past its initial imprint on
the crystals.
MCKAY
And this fantasy is based on?
CARTER
I suspect the gate is storing its ones and zeros on a subatomic
level within the structure of the crystals. So even though the
energy is dissipating, the most recent pattern still exists.
MCKAY
You suspect?
CARTER
We're dealing with a level of quantum physics here that is way
beyond us.
MCKAY
More than a third of the energy pattern the gate required, to
reintegrate Teal'c, has almost gone.
CARTER
I don't think so.
MCKAY
You're guessing wildly, like you always do. Maybe you could find a
way to fool the gate with reintegrating whatever it has stored in
the memory. But I say you won't like what comes out.
CARTER
Well, we'll see.
MCKAY
Major, Teal'c is dead, and this argument is a waste of time, because
the Pentagon is gonna order Hammond to resume operations in what...
(looks at his watch)
...sixteen hours.
CARTER
That's where they came up with the forty-eight hour deadline, isn't
it! You told them Teal'c would already be dead!
MCKAY
That's why it's called a deadline.
CARTER
(Getting up in anger)
God! You're a joke.

dumb blonds.

...system is down. Mark, get to the generator. Find out what's going
on. Peter! Paul! Report.
AGENT #2
What's going on?
INT--NID SURVEILLANCE ROOM
[Agent 1 draws a gun. Goes to the door and opens it. Maybourne zats
him.]
MAYBOURNE
(into his cell phone)
Okay, Jack. I'm in. Hit it.
[He checks the monitors.]
MAYBOURNE
You got two guys left guarding the Goa'uld.
INT--CELL ROOM
[Jack comes into the room and zats both guards. He and Adrian Conrad
look at each other.]
CONRAD
We meet again. Now what?
O'NEILL
Now you're gonna tell me what I want to know.
EXT--RUSSIA KREMLIN AT NIGHT
INT--PRIVATE SITTING ROOM
[Daniel pours himself some coffee and joins Major Davis at the table.]
DANIEL
Look. All I'm saying is, they did what we asked them to fix. Now,
all they're asking in return is what we already promised to give
them.
DAVIS
Have you lost your mind?
DANIEL
Should we be talking about this here?
DAVIS
I'm sure the room is bugged, but it doesn't matter. They already
know everything we're talking about. And they might as well know
that we are never going to be turning over refined weapon grade
naquadah.
DANIEL
I'm talking about naquadah generator technology. A clean and safe
source of power.
DAVIS
Which requires refined naquadah to work. Doctor Jackson, you of all
people realise the explosive power of the material.
DANIEL
Yes, so they could blow us up two hundred times over instead of just
one hundred. What difference does it make?
DAVIS
The difference is it would only take one nuke to get through our
anti-ballistic shield to do it. One!
DANIEL
The point is that you already owe them generator technology anyway,
along with everything else we found using the Stargate.
DAVIS
No, no, no. The point is we are not giving them the generator
technology and they're not giving us the DHD.
DANIEL
Can't you stipulate that we supervise how the naquadah is used? They
want to monitor our use of the gate.
DAVIS
That's not the point.
DANIEL
Isn't a more economically stable Russia better for everyone?
DAVIS
We don't know who they'll turn around and sell the technology to.
DANIEL
So, all this time we've been using the gate, to save the world,
we've really only been saving the good ol' US of A. Hah!
DAVIS
Dammit, Daniel. We don't even know for sure whether the DHD will
save Teal'c.
DANIEL
naquadah generator technology is years from practical widespread
implementation. In the meantime we get the DHD and prevent the
Russians from ever holding their gate over us again.
DAVIS
That's exactly why the Russians will never go for it.
DANIEL
Let's ask.
INT--SAFE HOUSE - CELL ROOM
[Maybourne ties and gags the two guards. O'Neill is looking through the
cell bars.]
O'NEILL
Let me in.
MAYBOURNE
Careful, Jack.
O'NEILL
Just do it.
[Maybourne finds the cell keycard and slides it through the lock.
O'Neill steps inside.]
O'NEILL
All right. Tell me what you told Simmons.
CONRAD
What in particular are you referring to?
O'NEILL
How do we save Teal'c?
CONRAD
Why should I tell you?
O'NEILL
Because if you don't, I'll kill you.
CONRAD
I doubt that.
[O'Neill zats him. As Conrad falls to the floor, O'Neill bends over
him.]
O'NEILL
What makes you think that I care if you live or die?
CONRAD
(shuddering from the electrical charge)
What about the host?
O'NEILL
He tried to kill a friend of mine, to save his own ass, so I don't
much care about him either.
[Conrad gets to his feet, O'Neill moves back.]
CONRAD
If you kill me Teal'c dies.
O'NEILL
Give me another choice.
CONRAD
Let me go. Once I am free I will contact you with the information.
O'NEILL
I think Teal'c would rather I shoot you.
CONRAD
Oh, go ahead. You know, Colonel Simmons was much better at this than
you. He, at least, offered me something of value in return for what
I know.
[O'Neill looks up and sees the camera above.]
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[He walks out, closing the cell door.]
INT--NID SURVEILLANCE ROOM
[O'Neill and Maybourne carefully open the door, zats at the ready.]
MAYBOURNE
I don't understand.
O'NEILL
There's a camera in that cell.
[He walks along the banks of equipment until he finds the video
cassette players.]
O'NEILL
We're looking for two days ago.
[They start hunting through the tapes. Maybourne pulls one out.]
MAYBOURNE
Got it!
[They put it in the player, and go to watch.]
INT--RUSSIAN PRIVATE SITTING ROOM
[The Russian Colonel comes in and throws a file on the table.]
DAVIS
That's what you want.
COLONEL
Not everything.
DAVIS
And we admitted the past agreement was ignored by both sides.
DANIEL
What we're saying is that we are willing to try and make it work,
now.
COLONEL
Allow our team full access to your base and all information related
to the Stargate. After a month we will assess delivery of the DHD.
DANIEL
Wait! That's not good enough. This is not a negotiation. You know
damned well we need that DHD right now. Someone's life is at stake
here. A very good friend of mine and that DHD could save them. When
your Russian team went missing SG-1 went along, with that friend, to
try and rescue them.
COLONEL
And in the process three more Russian soldiers died.
DANIEL
That's not our fault.
COLONEL
Colonel Zukhov was a very good friend of mine. And he is now dead,
Doctor.
DANIEL
Then you must know how I feel. Look, lend us your DHD. You can come
with it if you like...Please!
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter walks in to speak to Hammond]
CARTER
Sir. Daniel just called. The Russians have agreed to loan us the DHD
temporarily.
HAMMOND
Is that going to make a difference?
CARTER
Eventually it might.
HAMMOND
I've just been ordered to resume normal operation of the Stargate by
the President.
CARTER
Sir!
HAMMOND
SG-2 is prepping for a recon mission to P4C-796.
[Carter looks down at the activity in the gateroom.]
CARTER
Sir, you can't. I need more time.
HAMMOND
I've been given a direct order.
CARTER
I don't care what anyone says. You open that gate and you are
murdering Teal'c.
HAMMOND
My only other choice is to resign. If I resign I'll have no control
over who will be running this facility an hour from now. Is that
enough time?
CARTER
No.
HAMMOND
Tell me what else I can do.
CARTER
I can't, sir.
[SG-2 start lining up to go through the Stargate]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond walks into the control room, where Simmons stands.]
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Dial the gate.
[Davis, manning the computer, activates the keys. ]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[As Carter watches the gate spinning, a female officer approaches her.]
OFFICER
Major. There's a call for you from Colonel O'Neill. He says it's
urgent.
CARTER
Thank you.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter hurries down the stairs to Hammond.]
DAVIS
Chevron 5 encoded.
CARTER
Sir, you have to abort.
SIMMONS
Stand down, Major.
CARTER
Sir, Colonel O'Neill has obtained the information we need to save
Teal'c...
DAVIS
Chevron 6 encoded.
CARTER
...And he has evidence that will incriminate Colonel Simmons.
SIMMONS
Hah. He's lying.
HAMMOND
(to Davis)
Abort the dialling sequence. Airman.
(to a nearby airman)
Arrest Colonel Simmons.
SIMMONS
This is preposterous.
[Simmons pulls away from the airman.]
HAMMOND
Take him away. If he resists, shoot him!
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill, Carter and McKay watch the video as Conrad explains
to Simmons.]
CONRAD
You have to remove the master control crystal before you attach the
DHD. Otherwise the imprint will be erased.
[Hammond switches off the video.]
MCKAY
That's a joke. He's joking.
HAMMOND
Major?
CARTER
Well, theoretically...
MCKAY
Are you insane? He's a Goa'uld. He wants you to destroy yourselves.
If you remove the master control crystal there is nothing to
regulate the energy distribution. You get stray current going in the
wrong conduit, the whole gate could explode.
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
That true?
CARTER
Well, technically it's possible, sir. The gate is a very powerful
superconductor. But we could take steps to ensure...
MCKAY
You are a certifiable wack job. And...
(to Hammond)
you're no better if you listen to her. It's a wild guess. Her
judgement is being clouded by her personal feelings. Teal'c is
toast, he's history.
CARTER
Sir, I think we could make sure the risk was very small.
MCKAY
You try this harebrained scheme and you blow yourselves up - for
nothing. No way I'm hanging around for that.
HAMMOND
Your plane leaves for Russia in an hour, Doctor.
MCKAY
W..w...Russia?
HAMMOND
Your new assignment is to supervise the development of Russia's
naquadah generator program.
MCKAY
I'm not going to Russia. You know what the food is like in Russia?
Besides I'm a civilian. I don't have to do what you say.
CARTER
Well, as long as you're on the Air Force payroll.
MCKAY
This ...this really sucks.
[McKay hurries out.]
HAMMOND
Major. Do what you have to.
CARTER
Yes sir.
INT--GATEROOM
[Carter, Siler and his team work on the DHD. Siler hands the crystal to
Carter.]
SILER
Okay, Major.
[Carter looks up at the control room window where Hammond, O'Neill,
Daniel and the Russian Colonel are standing.]
CARTER
(to Hammond)
Sir. Master control crystal's been removed. We're ready to connect
the DHD.
HAMMOND
(into microphone)
Base has been evacuated of all non-essential personnel. You can
proceed, Major.
O'NEILL
(leans into microphone and calls to Carter)
Hey. You sure you want to be in there for this?
SILER
Not really, sir.
O'NEILL
I wasn't talking to you.
CARTER
Sir. If the gate blows up it won't matter where we are on the base.
O'NEILL
Right.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
DANIEL
(to Russian Colonel)
Not too late to change your mind about leaving.
COLONEL
(sighing)
I will stay.
INT--GATEROOM
CARTER
(to Siler)
Do it.
[Siler turns the switch that activates the gate. The gate spins but
with much electrical sparking. It stops and the event horizon, instead
of kawooshing, flares brightly. Teal'c stumbles out onto the ramp. The
sparking races around the gate, runs down the ramp to the DHD. The DHD
explodes, knocking Siler off his feet.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
DANIEL
(to Russian Colonel)
Well, that never happened in any of the simulations.
INT--GATEROOM
[Hammond and O'Neill enter. O'Neill puts his hand on Siler's shoulder.]
O'NEILL
Shake it off, Sparky.
[O'Neill mounts the ramp, followed by Carter.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, buddy. You alright?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
CARTER
Teal'c, as far you know what just happened?
TEAL'C
I have my revenge, Tanith is dead!
[O'Neill claps him on the shoulder.]
O'NEILL
That's nice. I'm happy for you.
CARTER
It's good to see you in one piece.
O'NEILL
Yes, we thought we lost you, again.
CARTER
Are you sure you're feeling perfectly normal?
TEAL'C
Yes. What has transpired here?
O'NEILL
Well, believe it or not you owe your life to a Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
Never!
O'NEILL
Yes.
FADE OUT
