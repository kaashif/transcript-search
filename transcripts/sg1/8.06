INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Klaxons are sounding and a security team is running through the
corridor.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[Teal'c is standing in the corridor and joins them as the team runs
past. As they go around a corner gunfire can be heard. The security
team, joining another one, stop at the doorway to the Gate room.]
TEAL'C
(to soldier)
Give me your weapon.
[Teal'c takes the weapon and nods for the soldier to open the door. As
the soldier swipes down his card in the access panel, the door opens.
Gunfire erupts out of the Gate room, hitting one of the men standing
with Teal'c.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[As Teal'c enters, a soldier falls to the ground, shot. More soldiers
are hit and many more are lying on the ground, dead. Teal'c shoots up
towards the ramp, where a super soldier is standing. The super soldier
is firing from both arms and turns to the other doorway as it opens,
shooting a couple of soldiers. O'Neill returns fire and is hit as h
enters the Gate room. He falls to the ground. Seeing this Teal'c
slightly lowers his weapon then notices that a soldier has dropped
another weapon on the ground. Teal'c forward rolls over the dead
soldier to pick up the weapon and, from a kneeling position, shoots at
the super soldier. A bright blue light is discharged from the weapon
and hits the super soldier, who falls to the ramp. Its eyelight fades
and dies. Teal'c stands, and as he turns to O'Neill, a bright light
envelops the room.]
INT--SGC LAB
[The light fades and Teal'c opens his eyes. He is strapped to a
Gamekeeper chair. Dr Lee is standing beside him, while another
scientist removes the headpiece from Teal'c. A monitor shows an image
of Teal'c's face in profile. More white-coated personnel are working at
the rear of the room.]
LEE
Simulation time, 49 seconds. That's not bad, not bad.
[Carter and O'Neill are standing in front of Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
How was it? Was it fun?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[Lee unstraps Teal'c from the chair.]
TEAL'C
You died well in battle, O'Neill.
[Teal'c rises from the chair. Carter turns to O'Neill, smiling
slightly.]
O'NEILL
Obviously, there's something defective with this thing.
[Carter's smile broadens.]
TEAL'C
Agreed.
[Lee turns to Teal'c, surprised.]
TEAL'C
An Anubis drone is a far more formidable warrior than this
simulation would suggest.
LEE
What?
[Lee is shocked.]
LEE
No, we've been working on this chair for two years, to make it a
viable virtual reality training tool for SGC personnel.
TEAL'C
You have failed.
[Lee is speechless.]
O'NEILL
He's nothing if not honest.
LEE
Well...
[Lee turns to the other scientists in the room, who simply shrug.]
LEE
I mean, maybe we could...it could use a little more work, but...
O'NEILL
Can you make it harder? More difficult?
LEE
Well...I mean, we can input the parameters for different scenarios,
but the vast majority of the simulation array comes from the mind of
the user. The programming is actually built by interfacing memories
from the individual's consciousness with the chair's matrix.
O'NEILL
Carter, all I heard was matrix, and I found those films quite
confusing.
CARTER
I think what Doctor Lee is trying to explain is that the simulation
actually learns its realism from the person using it.
O'NEILL
(quietly, to Carter)
What?
LEE
Yeah...no, we built it, we tested the software extensively, using a
variety of subjects.
[Lee walks over to the other scientists, who are nodding in agreement.]
LEE
Obviously, no one with Teal'c's field experience.
O'NEILL
Subjects. To whom do you refer?
[O'Neill glances over at the smiling scientists, who were obviously the
subjects. Neither O'Neill or Carter are impressed.]
LEE
Hey. If Teal'c would agree to work with us a little more. Look, all
you'd have to do is basically just play the game. Let it learn from
you.
[Teal'c looks over at O'Neill, eyebrow raised. O'Neill shrugs.]
LEE
Oh come on, it'd be fun. You would be so good.
TEAL'C
Very well.
[Carter smiles slightly as O'Neill shrugs.]
O'NEILL
There you go. Just make sure there's a beginners level, for the rest
of us.
LEE
Oh, yeah, we can always make it easier. Not that we'd have to, for
you, certainly. I mean, for others. But you'd...you'd be fine.
O'NEILL
Carter. Gentlemen.
[O'Neill leaves.]

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--DAY
INT--SGC LAB
[Carter brings in a table holding a monitor. Teal'c is again attached
to the chair, with Lee standing next to him]
LEE
Thanks to Colonel Carter's new code translation program, we can
actually monitor your progress through a graphic representation of
your point of view.
CARTER
You played Doom.
TEAL'C
I played Def Jam Vendetta.
[Carter grins at Teal'c.]
LEE
Exactly, yes.
[Two monitors on either side of Teal'c show images of his profile.]
LEE
Now, there is a two second delay between the chair's processor and
your perceived experience, but, umm...I mean, you shouldn't notice
anything.
[Lee walks over to a bank of four monitors, showing various images,
text and graphs.]
LEE
Anyway, we can store every aspect of your activity in the game and
then later choose what we're going to incorporate into our
programming of the training scenario. Oh, you understand, as before,
once your mind is interfaced with the chair we cannot forcibly
remove the connection, or cut power to the chair, without
endangering you.
[Carter is attaching various cables to the chair.]
TEAL'C
Indeed.
CARTER
It's a function of the new chair design. Since the whole gamekeeper
incident, the aliens of P7J-989 built the shut off command into the
internal programming. So only someone in the chair can control it.
TEAL'C
You have previously given me this information, Colonel Carter.
[Teal'c smiles at her, and Carter smiles back.]
LEE
This is a little different this time, because the game will actually
be learning from you and then incorporating those changes into its
programming code.
[Carter has moved to stand by the monitor which she brought into the
lab.]
CARTER
If you're killed in the game it will reset and you'll automatically
start again. The chair will only disconnect and end the game under
two conditions. Once you complete the scenario, or if you engage the
internal failsafe. Which of course, you're free to do at any time.
TEAL'C
That will be unnecessary.
[Lee turns from the monitor panel to look at Teal'c.]
CARTER
Don't be so cocky, Teal'c. The chair is intuitive. It's eventually
going to learn everything you know. Now, if you want to stop it
before the conclusion of the simulation, just get to the base
elevator, head for the surface. Ready?
TEAL'C
Proceed.
[Lee places the headpiece on Teal'c. Teal'c grimaces as he enters the
game. The game can be seen on Carter's monitor. The images appear as if
in a video game.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[On the monitor, a security team is running through the corridors.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME
[The security team arrive at the Gate room.]
TEAL'C
Give me your weapon.
[Teal'c takes the weapon and nods for the soldier to open the door. As
the soldier swipes down his card in the access panel, the door opens.
The super soldier is standing on the other side of the door and shoots
Teal'c. The game resets.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Teal'c struggles in the chair, as if in pain.]
CARTER
What just happened?
[Lee is studying the bank of monitors.]
LEE
It looks like the chair induced a pain response when he was killed.
CARTER
It's directly linked to his brain. We knew it was capable of this.
LEE
Yeah, but...it's just a simulation. It doesn't have to hurt.
CARTER
Yeah, see, that's the difference between you and Teal'c. He knows
that in a real situation your tactics would be completely different
if you thought you couldn't feel any pain.
LEE
Man, that was a heck of a shock.
CARTER
He wanted it to be realistic.
[Lee looks around and sighs.]
LEE
Well, fortunately, we limited the chair from being able to deliver
any sort of lethal jolt.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[The game has begun again. A security team is running through the
corridors.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[The security team run past Teal'c, who is standing in the corridor. He
watches them run past, then goes up the stairs to the Control Room.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CONTROL ROOM
[Teal'c accepts a weapon from one of the guards. He heads down the
steps to the door of the Gate room.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATE ROOM
[Teal'c does not enter from the usual door but walks around to the
opposite doorway, passing dead guards on the floor, dead and injured.
The door to the Gate room opens.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--GATE ROOM
[O'Neill is lying at the base of the ramp, seriously injured. Teal'c
kneels next to him.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Get out of here, Teal'c.
[The super soldier appears behind Teal'c and shoots him in the back.
The game resets.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Teal'c's body again reacts to the game and he shudders in the chair in
pain.]
LEE
That's twice. Looks like the chair is learning quickly.
CARTER
Don't count Teal'c out yet.
[Carter looks at the monitor, where the game has started again. Teal'c
enters the armoury and takes a vest and a P-90.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Teal'c, now wearing the vest and armed with the weapon, turns a
corner. A number of guards are lying in the corridor, dead. The drone
appears and Teal'c shoots at it. The drone returns fire and Teal'c
retreats around a corner. Teal'c runs through the corridors, shooting
back at the drone, which can be heard advancing towards him. Suddenly,
the drone's footsteps cannot be heard. Teal'c, puzzled, carefully looks
around the corner but another drone appears behind him and shoots him
in the back. As Teal'c falls to the floor, he is shot repeatedly by
both drones.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Daniel and Carter are watching the game on the monitor.]
DANIEL
Ooh! That's cold!
[Lee turns from the bank of monitors, obviously worried.]
LEE
Colonel, I'm uh...I'm pretty concerned about some of these bio
readings.
CARTER
Me too.
[Carter sighs and picks up a phone on the wall.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Dr Carmichael, this is Colonel Carter. Can you join us in science
lab five?
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Carter, armed, is running through the corridors, followed by a
security team.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[Teal'c comes towards Carter.]
CARTER
Teal'c!
[Teal'c stops and raises his hand to Carter as she appears before him.
She stops, halting the security team behind her.]
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter, I require your assistance.
CARTER
Likewise. SG3 came in hot. Sounds like our Gate room people could
use a little back-up.
TEAL'C
They are all dead.
CARTER
Excuse me?
TEAL'C
The Gate room has been breached. Our most affective defence would be
to seal off the east and south ends of level 28. If we act now we
may be able to force them into a crossfire.
CARTER
Force who?
TEAL'C
The two Anubis warriors.
CARTER
How the hell can you know that?
TEAL'C
Because they have chosen the same route seven of the last ten times.
[Carter looks at Teal'c, puzzled.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[Carter, Teal'c and the security team position themselves at a junction
in the corridor. They raise their weapons in readiness.]
VOICE OVER RADIO
Colonel, we have two hostiles heading your way.
CARTER
(into radio)
Roger that, we're in position.
(to other soldiers in corridor)
Heads up people!
[Both drones appear and begin firing at the soldiers, hitting most,
including Carter. The return fire has no affect on the drones.]
TEAL'C
Fall back.
[Teal'c and the final soldier are killed.]
INT--SGC LAB
[The monitor shows the game Carter lying on the ground, dead. The game
restarts.]
[Carmichael is examining Teal'c with a stethoscope.]
CARMICHAEL
Well, you were right to be concerned about these readings. Frequent
sympathetic spikes in his natural adrenaline production are causing
blood pressure and heart rate way too high to be sustained over the
long term.
CARTER
That last ambush should have worked. Why did the energy weapon have
no effect?
LEE
I don't know. Have you ever known a super soldier to be resistant to
the weapon like that in reality?
CARTER
No.
DANIEL
But it is possible, right? I mean, we've seen situations where the
Goa'uld have adapted their technology to defend against something
we've thrown at them.
LEE
Well, hopefully the game will also extrapolate possible solutions
and offer them to Teal'c.
[Daniel and Carter look at each other.]
LEE
Well, I mean, it'd just be fair.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Carter, armed, is running through the corridors, followed by a
security team.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
CARTER
Teal'c, SG3 came in hot. Sounds like the Gate room people could use
some backup.
[Carter stops in front of Teal'c who does not reply. The security team
runs past them.]
CARTER
We got to move!
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter, listen to me. The SGC has been penetrated by two
Anubis drones. Our weapons are now ineffective against their armour.
CARTER
How could you...?
TEAL'C
How is this possible?
CARTER
That's what I wanna know.
TEAL'C
I am speaking of the armour.
CARTER
It could have been altered to resist the effectiveness of the energy
weapon.
TEAL'C
Can they now be defeated?
CARTER
I've been working on a frequency modulator chip.
TEAL'C
Where is it?
CARTER
In my lab, but I still don't....
[Gunfire is heard.]
TEAL'C
Show me.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter and Teal'c run into the lab and Carter hands the chip to
Teal'c.]
CARTER
It's only a prototype
[As Teal'c places the chip in the weapon, shots are fired towards them
and they duck down behind the table. As the drone enters the lab,
Teal'c fires the enhanced weapon, killing the drone.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Warning, base autodestruct sequence, has been activated.
[Carter and Teal'c leave the lab.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Personnel lie dead in the corridors. As they arrive at a junction,
Daniel and a security team are under attack.]
DANIEL
Nice of you to join us.
CARTER
Been busy!
DANIEL
They've found a way to counteract our little weapons here.
[As the drone exits the Control Room, Teal'c shoots it with the
modified weapon.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Warning, base autodestruct sequence, has been activated. Thirty
seconds to detonation.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter runs into the Control Room, followed by Daniel and Teal'c and
de-activates the autodestruct sequence.
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Base autodestruct has been aborted.
CARTER
We're clear.
TEAL'C
Then the threat has been eliminated.
[Teal'c is obviously still unsure.]
TEAL'C
(questioningly)
The threat has been eliminated.
[Carter notices that Teal'c has a wound on his upper arm.]
CARTER
Teal'c, you're injured.
DANIEL
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
I'm fine.
INT--SGC LAB
[Lee is standing at the bank of screens as Carter and Daniel watch the
game on the monitor.]
LEE
I don't get it. That...that should be the end.
DANIEL
You're saying he should have won?
CARTER
Well, that was the conclusion of the originally programmed scenario.
CARMICHAEL
But the chair is not disconnecting.
LEE
Yeah, and the game's not resetting to the beginning, either.
DANIEL
Well, that's not fair. You can't win a race if someone keeps moving
the finish line.
LEE
He said he wanted it to be harder. More realistic.
DANIEL
In reality, we haven't defeated the Goa'uld.
LEE
Are you saying the game won't end until he defeats all the Goa'uld?
DANIEL
I don't know, you tell me. You said the game was learning the rules
from Teal'c.
CARTER
Yeah, but the parameters can't go beyond the base invasion scenario.
DANIEL
Can you get him out?
CARMICHAEL
Not without risking serious neural damage.
CARTER
The game has a failsafe. All Teal'c has to do is quit.
[Lee nods.]
DANIEL
(quietly)
Yeah. Teal'c quit.
[Carter and Daniel look at each other.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is sitting on a bed, his wound bandaged.]
DANIEL
Anubis' drones must have waited for SG3 to dial the Gate and
overwhelmed them at the last minute. But what I can't figure out is
how they knew how to set the base self destruct.
[Daniel moves to stand in front of Teal'c, next to Carter.]
CARTER
I can't believe General O'Neill is really dead.
TEAL'C
He is not dead.
CARTER
What?
[Teal'c rises.]
TEAL'C
We must focus on the situation. The threat has not been neutralised.
DANIEL
What?
[Teal'c puts on a vest.]
TEAL'C
We will search the base immediately. More warriors remain.
DANIEL
(unbelieving)
What?
CARTER
(to Daniel)
He also knew the super soldiers' armour was resistant to our energy
weapons.
DANIEL
Sergeant Harriman reported that there were only two intruders before
he got killed.
TEAL'C
They held the control room long enough to keep the iris open and let
others through.
DANIEL
Maybe, but the Gate logs would have indicated there was another
incoming wormhole.
TEAL'C
(determined)
The threat has not been neutralised. There are others, I am certain
of it.
DANIEL
Be...cause?
TEAL'C
The game has not yet ended.
[Daniel and Carter look at each other. Both are obviously worried.]
DANIEL
Teal'c, I know this isn't your strongest suit but this is a really
bad time for jokes.
TEAL'C
You are all part of a simulation, designed to test the SGC's
preparedness in case of Gate breach. None of you are real.
[Both Carter and Daniel look puzzled and concerned.]
TEAL'C
I am fine.
[An alarm suddenly sounds.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Warning. Base autodestruct sequence has been activated.
[They leave the infirmary.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Teal'c and Daniel enter the Control Room at a run. Carter
tries to abort the autodestruct.]
DANIEL
Sam?
CARTER
I don't understand it. Somebody must have reactivated the
autodestruct from a remote location.
[She continues to type at a keyboard.]
CARTER
I'm locked out of the system. I can't shut it down.
DANIEL
(to Teal'c)
How did you know?
[The self destruct activates and the game resets.]
INT--SGC LAB
CARMICHAEL
His heart rate and blood pressure are too high.
CARTER
How long can he do this?
[Carmichael shrugs.]
CARMICHAEL
I don't know. A day, maybe less.
DANIEL
I thought the chair wasn't supposed to be able to kill him.
CARTER
The physiological effects it can have at any one time are limited.
CARMICHAEL
Yes, but I'm afraid that while each individual pain stimulus isn't
in any way life threatening, the cumulative effect is now starting
to take its toll.
[Carter and Daniel look at Teal'c, strapped into the chair.]
CARMICHAEL
If he doesn't have a heart attack, he'll eventually run out of
adrenaline. His heart will slow down, his blood pressure will drop.
His entire organ system is going to fail.
DANIEL
Death by a thousand cuts.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CARTER'S LAB
[Teal'c enters the lab. Carter is working at the table.]
TEAL'C
You must disable the autodestruct command.
CARTER
What?
TEAL'C
The SGC will be breached by Anubis' warriors. They will attempt to
destroy the base via the autodestruct command.
CARTER
What are you talking about?
TEAL'C
If you disable the command they will be forced to use other means to
achieve their goal. Only then can we hope to defeat them.
CARTER
Teal'c, how could you possibly know?
[The alarms sound and a security team runs past the doorway.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
TEAL'C
There is little time.
[Both leave the lab.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Lee is reading from the screens.]
LEE
Colonel? He's at level 28. He's already got the modulator chip, and
he's used it to kill the first two super soldiers. He's hunting for
the third. Man, he's not in good shape.
[Carter and Daniel watch on the monitor as Teal'c is physically
attacked by a drone. The drone kicks and beats him. In the lab, Teal'c
reacts to the attack in the game, shuddering in the chair. In the game,
the drone picks Teal'c up off the floor and punches him.]
DANIEL
This is ridiculous. It's torturing him.
LEE
(frustrated)
Why won't he quit?
DANIEL
Wait a minute. He's headed for the elevator.
CARTER
He's going to use the failsafe.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LEVEL 28 ELEVATOR
[Teal'c collapses to the ground outside the elevator. e is being chased
by the drone. He gets in to the elevator, which closes just before the
drone gets to it. Teal'c slumps to the wall in relief. he elevator
rises and reaches Level One. Teal'c steps out of the elevator. Another
game has started.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[A security team runs past him Teal'c stands, shocked.] INT--SGC LAB
CARTER
It didn't work. He's back in the game.
[A scientist monitors Teal'c as O'Neill walks to Lee ho is seated at
the screens.]
O'NEILL
You know, I always thought a failsafe system was supposed to be
somewhat safe...from failure!
[Lee raises his hands and shrugs.]
CARTER
From the beginning, in Teal'c's mind, the goal was to make the
simulation as real as possible. As much as he must now wanna quit,
we think the game evaluated his character and decided that if this
were a real situation, Teal'c would never give up, under any
circumstances.
O'NEILL
Well, it's right. It's also just a game.
CARTER
The game doesn't know that.
[O'Neill nods.]
O'NEILL
So how do we get him out?
CARMICHAEL
Well, removing the connections while the system is operating is very
dangerous, potentially fatal. On the other hand, the physical stress
that the chair is putting him under will eventually kill him anyway.
CARTER
Right now, the only way out is for Teal'c to win the game.
O'NEILL
Can he?
CARTER
It seems to be getting harder and harder. Every time it appears he's
won, the game adds a new twist.
O'NEILL
So it's not going to let him win.
CARTER
No. The chair doesn't have an ego, it's not trying to beat Teal'c,
just provide a challenge that's worthy of his abilities.
DANIEL
Ironically, it's Teal'c's ego that created this problem in the first
place. Not that his self image isn't entirely accurate.
CARMICHAEL
If this continues, he's going to require adrenalin to sustain his
heart rate, and the thing is, I can't keep him going like this for
long.
CARTER
There has to be a way for him to win.
[O'Neill looks at Teal'c, concerned.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--LAB
[The drone enters the lab, obviously searching. As it walks further
into the lab Teal'c, who is crouched down at the side of the table,
shoots it.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Carmichael has injected into Teal'c's IV.]
CARMICHAEL
I think it's helping.
LEE
Yeah. Yeah.
[They both turn to look at Teal'c.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Teal'c carefully makes his way through the corridors, then retreats as
a drone approaches. He activates a smoke grenade and throws it in the
direction of the drone. Teal'c walks towards the drone and shoots it
through the smoke. Another drone materialises and shots Teal'c. The
game resets.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Teal'c shudders in pain and Daniel, standing at the monitor,
grimaces.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Carter is in a firefight with two drones. Teal'c walks up to join
her.]
CARTER
They've adapted their armour.
TEAL'C
Cover me.
[Teal'c moves to the other corner and shoots at the drones, hitting
one. The other continues firing.]
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter.
[Teal'c throws the modified weapon to Carter, who shoots and kills the
drone. Teal'c, walking to the drones, pulls an unit out of a bag.]
CARTER
Teal'c, what's going on? What are you doing with a thermograph
sensor?
[They both walk down the corridor, Teal'c pointing the sensor and
Carter prepared to fire.]
TEAL'C
There is a third drone.
CARTER
Are you sure? I thought only two came through.
TEAL'C
I am certain. He was using a cloak of invisibility.
[Turning a corner, a drone's footsteps can be heard although it cannot
be seen, apart from through the sensor. The drone turns and fires.
Teal'c returns fire, hitting the drone which collapses to the floor.]
CARTER
Nice one.
TEAL'C
It is not yet over
CARTER
There are more?
SILER
(over radio)
Colonel?
CARTER
(into radio)
Go ahead.
SILER
(over radio)
Ma'am, I've got a problem with the naquadah generator in storage
room 2809.
[Teal'c and Carter head down the corridor.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--STORAGE ROOM
[The doors to the storage room open, and Carter and Teal'c enter. As
Teal'c checks the area, Carter moves towards Siler, who is crouched
next to a generator.]
SILER
I can't stop it.
[Siler hands Carter a scanner.]
CARTER
Someone's rigged it on a feedback loop.
[She opens a port on the generator.]
CARTER
There's not enough time to stop the overload.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--GATE ROOM
[Teal'c, holding the generator, and Carter run into the Gate room.]
CARTER
(shouting into Control Room)
Sergeant, dial the Gate now. P4M-523
DAVIS
(over intercom, in Control room)
Yes ma'am, starting dialling sequence.
[The Stargate starts to activate. Teal'c and Carter turn to face the
Stargate.]
DAVIS
Chevron one encoded.
(pause)
Chevron two encoded.
[The noise from the generator is building.]
DAVIS
Chevron three encoded.
[Teal'c turns to Carter and nods slightly.]
DAVIS
Chevron four....
[Davis is zatted in the back. Teal'c and Carter turn to look up into
the Control Room, where Daniel appears, holding a zat.]
CARTER
Daniel? What the hell are you doing?
[Daniel's eyes flash, just as the naquadah generator explodes. The game
resets.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[A security team runs through the corridor.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[The team runs past Teal'c, who slides down the wall to his haunches,
looking defeated. Gunfire can be heard and personnel in the Control
Room are killed. Teal'c simply watches, sitting in the corridor.
Another drone appears, shooting more guards, and walks past Teal'c.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Warning! Base autodestruct sequence has been activated!
[The base explodes and the game resets. The game is played numerous
times, with Teal'c sitting on the floor, not taking part.]
INT--SGC ANOTHER LAB
[Daniel enters, walking up to Carter who is sitting at a monitor. An
empty "Gamekeeper" chair is to her side.]
CARTER
How's he doing?
DANIEL
Not well. His physical exhaustion is translating into the game. He's
having trouble even playing anymore. It still won't let him go.
CARTER
I spoke to one of the scientists on P7J-989. He says there's nothing
they can do under the circumstances.
DANIEL
What are you doing?
CARTER
They had a neural imprint of Teal's mind on file, from when we were
trapped in the chair six years ago.
DANIEL
Creepy.
CARTER
Yeah, I try not to think about it. Anyway, I'm running a simulation
on this chair, using the same parameters that Teal'c's dealing with
now.
DANIEL
And?
CARTER
Well, the imprint is nowhere near the same as a live active mind.
Plus, a lot has changed in the last six years.
DANIEL
Yeah, but not the essence of Teal'c's character.
CARTER
See? That's what worries me. I hope it has. Now, I have run hundreds
of simulations. No matter what Teal'c does, the programming adapts.
Every time it looks like he's won, the chair makes it harder. It's
almost like the game is reading Teal'c's mind, and somehow seeing
this one game as a microcosm for our war against the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Well, that's how Teal'c probably treats every battle we fight with
them.
CARTER
Well, according to these results. Six years ago, despite what Teal'c
led us to believe, deep down, he didn't really think the Goa'uld
could ever be defeated.
DANIEL
Well, he doesn't think that now.
[Carter shrugs slightly.]
DANIEL
He can't, not after everything we've accomplished.
CARTER
I hope you're right. Otherwise, no matter how long or how hard
Teal'c plays the game, he won't win.
INT--SGC LAB
[Carmichael is examining Teal'c as O'Neill stands,
watching. Carmichael moves to study the bank of screens.]
CARMICHAEL
This can't go on for much longer. We're going to have to make a
decision pretty soon about forcibly removing the connections.
[Carter looks over at Carmichael as Lee shakes his head briefly.
O'Neill is studying the chair.]
O'NEILL
You know, it's too bad we can't hook up a joystick to this thing.
Give him a little help, a little backup maybe.
[As Carter, Lee and Carmichael turn to O'Neill, Daniel shakes his head
in agreement.]
LEE
Actually...we could link up another chair and send someone else into
the same simulation. It wouldn't make any difference. The processors
would network and the second person would just fall victim to the
same altered elements in the simulation that have already trapped
Teal'c.
CARTER
Unless, the new player had an advantage.
(to O'Neill)
Sir, you may have done it again.
O'NEILL
Yes.
(pause)
How did I do it this time?
CARTER
These graphics are being generated by a data recorder that's
tracking the game. It's actually interfaced into the system between
the chair's processor and Teal'c. The chair decides what's going to
happen, Teal'c responds. Those responses are then incorporated,
processed, and we see the results. It's a continuous loop of ever
changing data.
O'NEILL
Oh!
(pause)
Still waiting on my good idea.
CARTER
The recorder causes a two second delay between the programming in
the chair and the experience in Teal'c's mind. He won't know the
difference, but we could use it to our advantage.
LEE
If we hook up the second chair to the first, without using the
recorder in the loop...
CARTER
...the new player would know what was about to happen in the game,
two seconds before it occurred.
[Lee and Carmichael nod their heads in understanding.]
DANIEL
Like precognition.
CARTER
Exactly. It's not much, but it might give us enough of an edge to
help both players win.
LEE
That's assuming the chair's programming won't become aware of it and
adapt.
CARMICHAEL
Which would mean that there's a good chance that the second player
could be trapped along with Teal'c.
O'NEILL, DANIEL & CARTER
(together)
I'll do it!
[The three look at each other, then at Teal'c.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[A security team is running through the corridors.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[Daniel is standing in the corridor and as the team run past he looks
around and sees Teal'c come from around a corner.]
DANIEL
Teal'c!
[Teal'c stops and raises his weapon towards Daniel.]
DANIEL
What are you doing? No...don't...don't...don't.
[Teal'c shoots Daniel, and the game restarts.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Daniel is attached to a chair next to Teal'c. O'Neill and Carter are
standing at the monitor watching the game. As Daniel shudders n the
chair, Lee turns to look at him.]
O'NEILL
Why'd he shoot him?
CARTER
Because Daniel was a Goa'uld in the last several simulations.
O'NEILL
I told you I should have gone.
CARTER
The last thing we needed was the game learning from your tactical
experience.
[The sound of gunfire is heard over the monitor and Daniel again
shudders in the chair.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Daniel stands in the corridor.]
DANIEL
I got to get used to this.
[Daniel turns to look at the security team running through the
corridor. There appears to be a shadow of the team running before
them.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[As Daniel sees Teal'c come around a corner, he hides in a nearby room.
Teal'c walks past.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CARTER'S LAB
[Teal'c is searching for something on the table. As he moves around the
table, he sees that Daniel is standing in the doorway, pointing a
weapon at him. Teal'c raises his weapon towards Daniel.]
DANIEL
Easy. Don't shoot. Just hear me out. Okay, it's me. I'm real. I'm
not a Goa'uld and I'm going to prove that to you, okay?
[Teal'c shoots Daniel and the game restarts.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Daniel flexes his hand. He is no longer holding a weapon.]
DANIEL
Crap!
[Daniel moves back to the wall as the security team un past.]
DAVIS
(over PA System)
Threat level, Foxtrot, Alpha 6. All security teams to the Gate room.
[Daniel runs in the opposite direction to the security team. A number
of guards and personnel are lying dead. A blast door opens and Teal'c
enters. Daniel zats him and he falls to the ground.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry buddy, you're going to have to listen to me.
[Daniel walks to a barely conscious Teal'c and takes the modified
weapon from him.]
DANIEL
Okay. Now, a minute ago we were in Sam's lab. I was trying to
convince you I was real, and you shot me, remember? What happened
next? The game reset. I know it's probably happened so many times
it's just one big blur but the reason it happened this time is
because I'm playing too. I'm in a chair, just like you. If either
one of us die, we both lose.
[Teal'c drags himself up into a sitting position. Daniel crouches next
to him and puts the modified weapon on the ground. Teal'c drags himself
to lean against the wall.]
TEAL'C
(defeated)
It will not let me out.
DANIEL
I know. The game thinks that in a real situation you'd never quit.
TEAL'C
No matter what I do, it is not possible Daniel Jackson. It is not
possible!
DANIEL
Yes, it is. That's why I'm here.
[Teal'c looks up at Daniel.]
DANIEL
Come on, let's do this. Together.
[Daniel reaches for Teal'c's arm and helps him up. Daniel hands the
weapon to Teal'c as gunfire is heard.]
TEAL'C
We must leave this area, immediately.
DANIEL
Yeah, I heard that.
[They leave in the opposite direction to the gunfire. Daniel and Teal'c
slowly approach a junction in the corridors.]
TEAL'C
You possess the ability to foresee the future?
DANIEL
A few seconds into the future. If I'm honest with you it's kinda
freakin me out. A few seconds is not a lot of time. At least...the
chance to see something happen and all you can see is...
[Daniel stops as Teal'c looks around the corner.]
DANIEL
...watch out.
[Teal'c starts to move into the corridor, and Daniel pushes him away to
the opposite side.]
DANIEL
No, seriously, watch out!
[Two drones appear and start firing. Daniel and Teal'c return fire but
it has no affect on the drones.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Carmichael turns from the bank of screens.]
CARMICHAEL
We're going to need a crash cart in here.
[Carmichael rushes to the phone.]
LEE
You can't introduce an electrical impulse to the chair like that.
CARTER
He's right.
CARMICHAEL
There's a very good chance Teal'c is going to go into cardiac arrest
if he suffers one more reset.
[O'Neill, Carter, Carmichael and Lee look at Teal'c and Daniel,
strapped in the chairs.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Teal'c and Daniel are firing at the drones when Daniel notices another
drone materialising behind Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Teal'c!
[The drone shoots Teal'c in the back and fires on Daniel. The game
resets.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Carmichael grabs a syringe and injects directly into Teal'c's heart.
Teal'c takes a deep breath.]
CARTER
He's got a pulse.
CARMICHAEL
That's not going to work again.
O'NEILL
I don't wanna see that again! I thought they were going to be able
to beat this thing.
CARTER
It may take Daniel a while to adjust to the precognitive abilities.
Plus, two seconds isn't a lot of time. He'll need the right
opportunity to take advantage of it.
[O'Neill, standing at the monitor, watches as Daniel runs down a
corridor.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CARTER'S LAB
[Teal'c opens the door to the lab and he and Daniel enter.]
TEAL'C
We've adjusted the modulator chip to compensate for the drones'
modified armour.
DANIEL
Any idea where she keeps it?
TEAL'C
It changes the location each time.
DANIEL
Of course it does.
[Teal'c and Daniel search the lab.]
DANIEL
Found it!
[As Daniel places the chip in his weapon he stops as he experiences a
premonition of a drone entering the lab and firing on them.]
DANIEL
Down.
[He and Teal'c duck below the table. The drone enters and fires at the
table. Daniel places the chip in his weapon then falls to the floor,
firing at the drone. The drone collapses to the ground. Teal'c rises,
looking at the drone.]
DANIEL
Yeah. This could work.
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--CORRIDORS
[Daniel and Teal'c carefully make their way along the corridors. Daniel
stops Teal'c from advancing as he experiences another premonition. They
move back along the corridor. A drone appears and walks away from
Daniel and Teal'c. The drone stops, looking around, and Teal'c prepares
to shoot it but the drone walks on.]
DANIEL
Why didn't you shoot him?
TEAL'C
Such an action has always proven fatal. In a previous version of the
game when I've eliminated a drone from this location, it has
inevitably attracted the attention of a third cloaked drone.
DANIEL
Then you shoot him too.
TEAL'C
It is merely a diversion designed to allow a Goa'uld time to destroy
the base. It will use either our self destruct mechanism or naquadah
generator designed to overload.
DANIEL
And if you tried to stop one, it uses the other. I suppose the
identity of the Goa'uld always changes too.
TEAL'C
Yes. I believe it to be the final component of the game we must
overcome.
[Suddenly, gunfire breaks out in the distance. Daniel and Teal'c make
their way towards it but Daniel stops Teal'c as he experiences another
premonition. They turn back as two drones appear from the direction
they would have gone. As Daniel and Teal'c run down the corridor, the
drones fire on them. Turning around a corner, they pass an elevator
which suddenly opens. O'Neill and a number of guards exit the elevator,
firing on the drones. The drones are not affected by the gunfire and
advance on the elevator. As they come into view, Daniel and Teal'c fire
on them, disabling both drones.]
O'NEILL
You guys all right?
[O'Neill pulls Daniel to his feet.]
DANIEL
Oh, yeah, thanks.
[Teal'c is obviously thinking.]
TEAL'C
The naquadah generator.
[Teal'c and Daniel leave.]
O'NEILL
You guys all right?
[O'Neill follows Teal'c and Daniel.]
INT--SGC WITHIN GAME--STORAGE ROOM
[Teal'c and Daniel enter the store room. Carter is crouched to the
generator, working n it. Teal'c aims his weapon at Carter.]
CARTER
Almost got it, just give me a second.
TEAL'C
Put down the device.
[Carter looks up at Teal'c, surprised.]
CARTER
Teal'c, what are you doing? We've got less than a minute before this
thing goes critical.
[O'Neill enters and looks in surprise at Teal'c, who points the weapon
at him.]
O'NEILL
T?
TEAL'C
Step away!
DANIEL
I'd do as he says.
[O'Neill turns to Carter and they both step away from the generator.
O'Neill notices Siler lying on the ground further inside the storage
room.]
O'NEILL
What the hell's going on here?
[The noise of the generator continues to build.]
CARTER
Teal'c, we're all going to die if you don't let me stop that
overload.
TEAL'C
She may be a Goa'uld.
CARTER
It was Siler.
O'NEILL
Siler?
DANIEL
Siler?
CARTER
He was in here. I found him setting the generator.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, put the weapon down. That's an order.
DANIEL
(to Teal'c)
What if it's not her? You said yourself you could never tell who it
was until the last second.
TEAL'C
You may be correct Daniel Jackson.
[Teal'c turns his weapon on O'Neill, who raises his own weapon at
Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
[Daniel and Carter point their weapons at each other.]
O'NEILL
Now what?
DANIEL
I know for a fact it's not me or Teal'c.
[Teal'c, under obvious strain, looks at the generator.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
I don't know. I can't tell.
[Teal'c lowers his weapon, followed by O'Neill, who nods at Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
[Carter crouches at the generator and opens a scanner. As Siler
suddenly materialises, Daniel yells and moves.]
DANIEL
Teal'c!
O'NEILL
Carter!
[O'Neill ducks as Siler begins to shoot. Daniel drags Teal'c to safety
and, as Siler's eyes glow, Teal'c fires upon him. He falls to the
ground, dead. O'Neill and Carter rise as Teal'c and Daniel reenter the
room. The game ends.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Daniel, still attached to the chair, wakes, obviously disoriented.]
DANIEL
Is it finished?
CARTER
Yeah, you did it.
[Daniel lays his head back. Teal'c slowly wakes.]
CARTER
Shutting off power to both chairs.
[O'Neill walks up to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Hey.
[O'Neill pats Teal'c on the arm and clasps his shoulder.]
TEAL'C
We have won.
O'NEILL
Well, it's what we do.
[Teal'c nods and smiles slightly.]
