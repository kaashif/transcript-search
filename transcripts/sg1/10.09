EXCERPTS FROM 5.11 "SUMMIT"
EXT--SPACE
[A tel'tak approaches a Goa'uld space station.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Daniel, dressed in the costume of Lord Yu's lo'taur approaches Jacob
with a box. Daniel takes out a ring from the box and places it on his
own finger.]
JACOB
All you have to do is prick him, once. The effect will be immediate.
He'll believe you to be his loyal slave, Jarren.
EXCERPTS FROM 9.04 "THE TIES THAT BIND"
EXT--UNNAMED PLANET, DAY
[Mitchell and Teal'c, wearing leather outfits, raise their weapons at
Tenat and Jup in a stand-off.]
MITCHELL
Whoa, no violence.
TENAT
Your name?
MITCHELL
Cam Mitchell, bounty hunter.
[Later...]
[Rings descend over Mitchell and Teal'c, leaving an unconscious Jup in
their place and stranding Tenat.]
EXCERPT FROM 9.16 "OFF THE GRID"

NETAN
Don't worry about SG-1...and Earth. They are of little consequence.

TEASER
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey moves through hyperspace.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Colonel Emerson sits in the command chair. Major Marks sits at the
port control. Carter stands between them.]
MARKS
Approaching the coordinates now, sir.
EMERSON
Drop us out of hyperspace. Maximum shields.
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey drops out of hyperspace.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
EMERSON
Colonel?
[Carter steps forward and looks out the main viewport. All she sees is
open space.]
CARTER
(confused)
We should have a visual. If the second Supergate is here, we should
be able to see it.
EMERSON
Anything on the sensors?
MARKS
There seems to be a powerful gravitational field nearby.
[Carter steps back and looks over Marks' shoulder at his viewscreen.
Emerson leans closer.]
EMERSON
Supergates use black holes for power.
CARTER
Oh, this is not a black hole. It's a neutron star, and the field is
powerful enough to weaken our shields and cause--
[Carter is interrupted by a blast that rocks the bridge and causes
sparks to shower the room.]
EMERSON
Damage report!
MARKS
Reporting hull damage on decks two and seven.
EMERSON
(to starboard station)
Battle stations!
(to Marks)
Get us out of here, Major.
MARKS
Hyperdrive will not engage.
CARTER
Hull integrity has been compromised!
EMERSON
Who the hell is shooting at us?
[Marks' radar image shows three bogeys approaching the Odyssey.
Incoming fire continues to rock the bridge and cause damage.]
MARKS
I can't tell, sir. Detecting three ships.
EMERSON
Ori?
MARKS
Based on size, I'd say Goa'uld mother ships.
CARTER
Their shields should be weakened as well.
EMERSON
(to starboard station)
Fire all forward rail guns. Arm missiles.
(to Marks)
Major, transfer auxiliary power to sublight engines. And set a
course, hard right.
EXT--SPACE
[Ha'taks fire on Odyssey. It banks to starboard and tries to head away
from the ha'taks.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
MARKS
Sir, detecting multiple small objects, dead ahead.
[Carter stares at the viewport and sees that the area in front of the
ship is littered with small objects.]
CARTER
Oh my God. It's a minefield!
EMERSON
Full reverse thrust!
EXT--SPACE
[Odyssey moves through a large minefield, decelerating but not
reversing course. Some mines impact the Odyssey's forward shields, but
others strike the belly of the ship itself, causing small explosions.
The forward shields fail, and more explosions rock the vessel. The
Odyssey stops moving.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Alarms blare. Emerson stands from where he has been thrown out of his
seat.]
EMERSON
Damage report!
[Emerson looks around. Carter and other crew members lie on the floor,
unconscious. Marks is slumped over in his chair. Small fires and sparks
are active throughout the bridge.]
EMERSON
Marks!
[Emerson looks at Marks' monitor. It blinks "Shield Failure" and "Hull
Failure".]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry approaches Harriman's station.]
HARRIMAN
Emergency subspace communication from the Odyssey, sir.
LANDRY
Put it onscreen.
[The video monitors show a static filled image of Emerson on the
damaged bridge of Odyssey.]
EMERSON
(over transmission)
Stargate Command, this is Colonel Paul Emerson of the Odyssey,
authentication code delta six, delta five. We're under attack! We've
suffered extreme damage! Intel about the second Supergate was false.
We've been ambushed by as many as three Goa'uld mother ships. We've
lost hyperdrive. Shields are down! Several decks without life
support. We're being boarded.
[There is an explosion on the bridge and Emerson turns away. The video
image turns to complete snow.]
HARRIMAN
(shaking his head)
That's it, sir. That's all we've got.
[Landry looks grave.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Vala, Daniel, and Mitchell stand with Landry in front of a monitor
which shows a blinking dot on a map of space.]
LANDRY
We began receiving telemetry from the emergency transponder
approximately thirty minutes after the distress call came in.
DANIEL
Unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything about the condition of
the ship or...the crew.
LANDRY
Sounds like it was badly damaged.
DANIEL
Anything on who might have been behind this?
LANDRY
We were acting on what we thought was reliable intel from the Jaffa.
[Teal'c walks up the stairs and joins the others.]
TEAL'C
Bra'tac is investigating the source of the false intel, but the
Jaffa Nation is in disarray, and many have reverted back to old
warring factions. Tracing such betrayal may prove virtually
impossible.
VALA
There must be a lot of Jaffa out there who are pretty angry about
the destruction of Dakara.
DANIEL
The Ori were responsible for that.
LANDRY
There are more than a few who think it was us who led them there.
MITCHELL
Angry enough to set up an ambush? For what, revenge?
VALA
Well, we have a signal. Let's go check it out.
DANIEL
Yeah, one tiny snag there.
TEAL'C
We have no vessels in which to travel.
LANDRY
The Daedalus is on its way to Pegasus.
TEAL'C
And it will be days before a Jaffa ship becomes available to us.
VALA
Well, you only have to ask. You must know by now that I can get you
pretty much anything you want.
[Mitchell and Daniel look at Vala warily.]
DANIEL
Yeah, for a price.
VALA
(dismissively)
Nothing comes for free, Daniel. Of course, in this instance, I would
naturally waive my fee. But...I will need some front money, so to
speak.
[Mitchell closes his eyes. Daniel shoots an incredulous look at Teal'c.
Teal'c rolls his eyes and looks annoyed.]
LANDRY
Be careful. We still have no idea who's behind this.
[Mitchell and Daniel exchange disbelieving looks.]
INT--ODYSSEY CARGO BAY
[Carter awakens to find herself sitting on the floor of the cargo bay.
There are some scrapes on her forehead. Many of the crew are standing
around, some are injured. She stands, and Emerson approaches.]
EMERSON
Glad to see you're awake, Colonel. How's your head?
CARTER
It's fine, sir. What's our status?
EMERSON
They towed us out of the minefield. Most of the crew is accounted
for. We're still missing three.
[The cargo bay door opens, and four armed guards enter.]
SOLEK
Which one of you is Colonel Samantha Carter?
[Carter takes a deep breath and looks at Emerson. He's already moving
forward.]
EMERSON
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson, commander of this ship. If you have any
questions, you ask me--
[Solek backhands Emerson so hard he stumbles. The other guards raise
their weapons. Emerson rights himself, looking wary.]
SOLEK
If any of you try to be heroes, I assure you my commander will think
nothing of venting this hold of all atmosphere. I will not ask
again.
CARTER
I'm Carter.
[She steps forward.]
SOLEK
Bring her. Him too.
[Carter and Emerson exchange looks as the guards escort them out.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Anateo lounges in the commander's chair. Steam still appears in
various parts of the bridge. Solek leads guards holding Carter and
Emerson by the upper arms onto the bridge. They walk to the front of
the bridge and release the prisoners. Carter winces and grabs her upper
arm. Emerson stands defiantly.]
ANATEO
Colonel Carter. I had heard you were quite attractive.
EMERSON
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson, commander of this ship. What do you want?
ANATEO
(standing and walking towards Carter)
Nothing you can do for me. Now, Colonel Carter on the other
hand...Can I call you Samantha?
CARTER
No...You're Lucian Alliance.
ANATEO
(scoffing)
The uniform. Pathetic, isn't it? Pretending to be something we're
not. Anateo is my name, and believe me, I am part of no alliance of
any kind. Now, we don't know much about this ship yet, but we have
found a subspace beacon that is giving away our position. I need you
to shut it off.
CARTER
I'm not going to help you.
ANATEO
(looming over Carter)
I don't see what choice you have. You are going to do whatever it is
I want you to do.
EMERSON
Don't do it, Sam.
[Solek lifts his weapon and cocks it.]
ANATEO
Oh, I suggest you should do it..."Sam."
[Carter glares at Anateo. He studies her for a moment, then grabs her
by the collar with both hands. Carter is unable to breathe well through
his tight hold of the material around her throat as he drags her over
to the transponder in the corner of the bridge. He shoves her over and
releases her. She stands up straight and gingerly touches her throat.]
CARTER
It's not designed to be shut off. It activates automatically and
stays on.
ANATEO
Then remove it!
EMERSON
Don't help them, Colonel. That's an order!
[Solek fires point blank at Emeron's chest. He looks down in shock
before falling onto the deck. Solek fires several more times at Emerson
from close range as Carter watches in horror.]
ANATEO
I believe that now makes you the ranking officer on this ship,
Colonel Carter. I suggest you get to work. Unless there's something
else you'd rather do.
[Carter breathes heavily and fights back tears as she looks in shock at
Emerson's body.]
EXT--SPACE
[A cargo ship flies through hyperspace.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[The rest of SG-1 are clad in leather outfits. Vala sits in the pilot's
chair, Daniel in the chair next to her. The engine rumbles with a
strange whine, and the ship has a noticeable shudder as it moves.]
MITCHELL
(sarcastic)
Yep, she's a real beauty.
VALA
Stabilizers are a bit wonky, I'm afraid. Makes for a bumpy ride, but
it's all perfectly safe.
MITCHELL
Really?
[The team is thrown forward as a crashing sound is heard within the
ship.]
VALA
(wincing)
Not exactly.
DANIEL
We gave you as much raw naquadah as you needed, and all you came up
with was this piece of junk?
VALA
People's lives are at stake, Daniel. Do you honestly think that I
cheaped out on the ship and pocketed the difference?
[Daniel sighs and looks away. An alarm begins to beep.]
MITCHELL
What's that?
VALA
Life support seems to be failing.
(to Teal'c)
Can you take over?
[Teal'c sits in the pilot's chair as Vala goes to a side panel and
shifts a crystal inside it. The alarm stops. Vala closes the panel.]
MITCHELL
Great, you fixed that. How about fixing the stabilizers?
VALA
Oh, I didn't fix anything. I just disabled that annoying alarm.
[Daniel looks over, astonished.]
TEAL'C
Our long range sensors indicate that the signal coming from the
Odyssey transponder is changing location.
MITCHELL
It's moving?
TEAL'C
It appears to be travelling at sub-light speed. Altering course to
intercept.
EXT--SPACE
[The cargo ship exits hyperspace.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
MITCHELL
Are you cloaking?
TEAL'C
I am attempting to. It does not appear the cloak is responding.
[Vala kicks the center console.]
EXT--SPACE
[The cargo ship slowly cloaks in a barrage of electrical arcs.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Everyone looks at Vala, who shrugs innocently. A display appears
holographically in front of them giving an image of the planet and
pinpointing the transponder signal.]
TEAL'C
The signal now appears to be originating from that planet. Sensors
are picking up numerous life signs.
DANIEL
If life support were compromised, they could've landed the ship for
repairs.
TEAL'C
(agreeing)
Mmm. They are not responding to our hails. There appears to be a
small civilization on the surface.
VALA
(smiling)
I knew I recognized this planet.
MITCHELL
More "friends" of yours?
VALA
The Goa'uld used to have a ship building facility here. It's now
been taken over by the former human slaves. From what I know, they
have ties with the Lucian Alliance.
MITCHELL
You know, that doesn't sound too good. We talkin' "chop shop" here?
VALA
I have a contact here. He might get skittish if we all show up, so
it could be a good idea for me to go in alone.
MITCHELL
You know, it could be a trap.
VALA
All the more reason why we shouldn't all go. Trust me, if he knows
anything I'll be able to get it out of him, but the key is to be as
inconspicuous and as "non-threatening" as possible.
[Mitchell continues to look unconvinced.]
VALA
If you like, I can take Daniel.
[Daniel raises his eyebrows and looks over at her.]
INT--ODYSSEY CARGO BAY
[The guards shove Carter inside and close the doors. Marks gets up and
approaches her.]
MARKS
(concerned)
Colonel, what happened? You've been gone for hours...Where's Colonel
Emerson?
[Carter shakes her head and grimaces. Tears silently roll down her
cheeks as she sniffs back further emotion.]
INT--ALIEN HANGAR, PLANET SURFACE
[Vala and Daniel approach the far end of the hangar where Borzin is set
up. Daniel no longer wears his glasses.]
BORZIN
Vala Mal Doran! I never thought you'd show your face in these parts
again.
VALA
Borzin, you slimy, two-faced, grease peddler.
[Borzin pretends to be affronted.]
VALA
Come on, give us a hug.
[Bozin holds out his arms as Vala leaps into them, wrapping her legs
around him. He groans, and she gets down. Borzin looks appraisingly at
Daniel who crosses his arms and watches.]
BORZIN
And what poor loser have you conned into your company this time?
VALA
Oh, this is my apprentice, Shamus.
BORZIN
(to Daniel)
Huh. You must be learning a great deal.
[Daniel smiles facetiously.]
DANIEL
More than I'd like to.
VALA
Actually, I took him on as part of a bet.
(whispering)
He's mentally disabled.
BORZIN
Ah...
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Mitchell and Teal'c sit in the ship, listening to a transmitter
broadcasting their teammates' conversation with Borzin. Mitchell and
Teal'c exchange glowering looks.]
BORZIN
Don't trust her, she will sell you out for a bad lunch the first
chance she gets.
INT--HANGAR
DANIEL
(grinning and shaking his head)
I know.
BORZIN
Hmm.
VALA
(pointing at Daniel)
He likes me. Isn't that cute?
[Daniel smiles in an exaggerated manner at Vala, wrinkling his nose and
shrugging. Borzin laughs, then instantly sobers.]
BORZIN
What do you want, Vala, if you haven't already stolen it from me?
VALA
We're looking for some information.
DANIEL
About a Tau'ri ship that was attacked not far from here. Any
information you can give us...
[Borzin looks away. Vala leads him away from Daniel and speaks low to
him.]
VALA
Okay, my friend, here's the thing. He's not my apprentice, he's a
mark.
BORZIN
(gasping, mockingly)
No!
VALA
A very rich, very gullible one who's eating right out of my hands.
Give us something, anything, and he'll make it very much worth your
while.
BORZIN
(scoffing)
You know, I've heard that before.
VALA
All right, try this. We traced the signal from the ship's emergency
transponder here. I know you can't possibly have the whole ship, but
I know you must have some parts. Borzin, I don't know what's going
on, but you're in way over your head.
[Borzin scoffs again.]
VALA
I've recently made some contacts high up in the Lucian Alliance
that'd be very interested in knowing exactly how much you've been
skimming off this operation.
BORZIN
Wow. Offers that can't be refused, heh. Over here.
[He leads Vala to some equipment. Daniel grabs her arm as she passes
by.]
DANIEL
(low to Vala)
While we're at it, why not get him to throw in some parts for our
cargo ship?
VALA
One thing at a time.
[They both turn back to Borzin who holds the activated transponder. He
hands it to Daniel.]
BORZIN
Is this what you're looking for?
DANIEL
That's Odyssey's data recorder. The transponder's still
broadcasting.
VALA
Where did you get this?
BORZIN
A man brought it a few hours ago. He said it could fetch me a very
nice price.
[Borzin takes the transponder back and activates the playback on the
recorder.]
ANATEO
(on recorder)
Anateo is my name...
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c and Mitchell react to hearing the Odyssey recorder playback.]
ANATEO
(on transmission of recorder)
...and believe me, I am part of no alliance of any kind.
INT--HANGAR, PLANET
[Borzin fast forwards the recording.]
CARTER
(on recording)
It's not designed to be shut off.
INT--CARGO SHIP
CARTER
(on transmission of recorder)
...It activates automatically and stays on.
ANATEO
(on transmission of recorder)
Then remove it!
EMERSON
(on transmission of recorder)
Don't help them, Colonel. That's an order!
[Mitchell and Teal'c exchange looks. A shot is heard on the recorder.
Mitchell and Teal'c jump at the sound.]
INT--HANGAR
BORZIN
You want more, show me the naquadah.
DANIEL
You know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to
you.
BORZIN
Ooh, timing's everything.
(he gestures behind Vala and Daniel)
Him.
[Daniel and Vala turn and see Solek aiming a zat'nik'tel at them.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[As Mitchell and Teal'c listen, two zat blasts sound through Daniel's
transmission.]
MITCHELL
(keying radio)
Jackson? Vala?...Jackson, report!
[Mitchell and Teal'c exchange worried looks.]
MITCHELL
Crap.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[A digital voice recorder on the table plays the last few minutes of
Daniel and Vala's transmission.]
BORZIN
(on recording)
You want more, show me the naquadah.
DANIEL
(on recording)
You know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to
you.
BORZIN
(on recording)
Ooh, timing's everything...Him.
[Two zat blasts sound through the recording. Mitchell shuts off the
player. He and Teal'c are sitting next to each other. Landry sits at
the end of the table.]
MITCHELL
We suspected it could be another ambush.
LANDRY
You think they were specifically after you?
TEAL'C
They knew we would follow the transponder signal.
LANDRY
Why?
TEAL'C
Perhaps they were trying to deter us from trying to find the
Odyssey.
MITCHELL
Personally, I think they just don't like us.
LANDRY
Hmm. I can see why they might not be your biggest fans.
MITCHELL
Well, whatever the reason, there was no other way to retrieve this
intel. The recording suggests the Odyssey wasn't destroyed, but is
in the hands of the Lucian Alliance. Unfortunately, that's all we
got. Borzin disappeared along with Daniel and Vala, and no one else
we talked to knew anything.
LANDRY
Teal'c, spread the word among the Jaffa. Tell whoever will listen I
want to talk to the leader of the Lucian Alliance!
[Landry gets up and heads out of the room. Mitchell rises on his
superior's departure, then sits back down next to Teal'c.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Carter studies a crystal display while Anateo looks on, eating a power
bar. Other Lucian Alliance members are at some of the stations.]
ANATEO
I've always felt civilization can be judged by two things--its food,
and its women. I'd say yours is only half-way there.
[Carter smiles at him with no humor, then directs her attention back to
the crystals. Anateo offers part of the power bar, but she does not
react.]
ANATEO
Hmm? I don't blame you. But you have to keep up your strength. You
have a whole ship to fix.
CARTER
You know, that could take the rest of my life.
ANATEO
(looming closer)
Whether that is long, or painfully short, is up to you.
[Carter gives him a cautious, appraising look. Both are distracted by
approaching footsteps. Borzin and armed Lucian members, including
Solek, escort Daniel and Vala, who both have their hands tied behind
their backs.]
CARTER
Daniel! Vala!
[Both give Carter false grins.]
DANIEL
(with false brightness)
Hi, Sam!
VALA
(with false brightness)
We thought you'd miss us.
[Carter smiles back at them.]
ANATEO
Where are the others?
BORZIN
(shrugging)
Listen, there is that small matter of my fee.
ANATEO
Oh, of course. Half payment for half of SG-1.
VALA
Two-fifths, actually.
[Daniel elbows her with his restrained arms. Vala gasps.]
VALA
(muttering)
It's a small quibble, but...
BORZIN
(to Vala)
Don't help me!
(to Anateo)
Look, it is not my fault that only two of them showed up.
ANATEO
(smiling)
Of course.
(to Solek)
Take care of him.
[Borzin and Solek start to move away. Borzin pauses by a frowning
Daniel and Vala, who is biting her lip.]
BORZIN
(to Vala and Daniel)
Uh, look, I, uh, I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be seeing you
again. Hee hee hee.
[Daniel and Vala exchange knowing looks at Borzin's likely fate.]
VALA
No, I think not.
ANATEO
Put them in the hold.
DANIEL
Don't worry, Sam. It's all part of the plan.
[He gives her a reassuring smile, and Vala winks at Carter before both
are escorted off the bridge. Sam weakly smiles and nods in return. She
distractedly twirls the socket wrench in her hand. Noting that Anateo
has turned back to her, she continues spinning it while getting back to
work on the crystal display.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Major Escher stands in front of a white screen showing a flow chart of
the Lucian Alliance hierarchy, complete with pictures of the members.
He gives a briefing to Landry, Mitchell, and Teal'c.]
ESCHER
Each division of Lucian Alliance territory is controlled by one of
Netan's lieutenants, or "seconds", as they're called. There are
about twenty such individuals overseeing operations including
smuggling, extortion, racketeering, and of course, trafficking in
kassa.
LANDRY
Is there anything new coming? Because this feels like a rerun to me.
ESCHER
Well, we've been following up on rumors of betrayal and possible
mutiny among the seconds. There seems to be mounting dissent over
Netan's leadership.
LANDRY
Well, that's good, but how does it help us?
[Escher points to a indecipherable picture on the flowchart.]
ESCHER
Kefflin, one of Netan's most loyal and trusted seconds. He oversees
a large kassa production operation on a remote group of planets on
the outskirts of the galaxy.
LANDRY
What about him?
ESCHER
(swallowing and glancing at Mitchell)
Besides the fact that he's a brutal killer with a notorious
temper...
MITCHELL
(interjecting)
We only know of him by reputation, sir. He's extremely reclusive and
rarely, if ever, leaves his command ship. Very few, if any, of
Netan's inner circle have ever met the guy.
LANDRY
You think this Kefflin is behind the disappearance of the Odyssey?
MITCHELL
No, sir. I think he's the perfect candidate to impersonate.
LANDRY
(surprised)
Excuse me?
[Mitchell leans forward and starts fingering a small box in front of
him.]
MITCHELL
I am suggesting that I infiltrate the Lucian Alliance. It's the only
way we're gonna get reliable information on the Odyssey.
LANDRY
You don't even have a decent picture of the man!
MITCHELL
That's what makes him the perfect candidate, sir.
[Mitchell opens the box and passes it over to Landry. Landry picks up
the box and looks at a ring and vial of chemical.]
MITCHELL
The Reole chemical. Doctor Jackson used it a few years back to
infiltrate a System Lords' summit. One jab of that and Netan will
believe I am who I say I am regardless of what I look like. No one
else will question me because no one else has ever seen him.
LANDRY
(skeptically)
So you think.
MITCHELL
I'm not saying it isn't risky...sir. I'm saying we have to do
something.
INT--ODYSSEY CARGO BAY
[Lucian guards shove Carter into the room. Various crew members are
milling around in small groups. Daniel and Vala, who sit on a box,
stand and approach Carter.]
VALA
How are you holding up?
CARTER
I'm working as slowly as I can, but I can't keep it up forever.
DANIEL
Do you have any idea what they're planning on doing with the ship?
VALA
Or us, for that matter?
CARTER
No, but without the transponder, Stargate Command doesn't have a
hope in hell of finding us.
VALA
(sighing)
Our only chance is to take this ship back.
CARTER
Well, I have an idea about that, but it's pretty risky.
VALA
Well, it's probably better than our plan.
CARTER
Well, what's your plan?
DANIEL
We don't have one.
CARTER
Ah.
EXT--SPACE
[The cargo ship approaches a ha'tak.]
INT--CARGO SHIP
[An alarm sounds, and Teal'c deactivates it while flying the rickety
ship.]
TEAL'C
They have detected us. Colonel Mitchell. Are you prepared?
[Mitchell appears, placing the ring on a finger on his right hand. He
wears the uniform of a Lucian Alliance member.]
MITCHELL
Prepared as I'll ever be.
[Mitchell leans forward as Teal'c activates the communicator. Vashin
appears on a viewscreen.]
VASHIN
State your business.
MITCHELL
I'm Kefflin. I'm here to see Netan.
INT--HA'TAK
VASHIN
You are not expected.
MITCHELL
(over communicator)
I don't have to be expected. Authorize me for immediate transport,
or I'll have your head as an ornament for my ship.
VASHIN
(nervous)
I will notify Netan of your arrival.
INT--NETAN'S HA'TAK, RING ROOM
[Mitchell rings on board into the heavily guarded ring room. Vashin
meets him there. Mitchell cautiously looks around.]
MITCHELL
Where's Netan?
VASHIN
I will take you to him.
MITCHELL
Fine. Let's go.
VASHIN
First, you must submit to a search.
MITCHELL
(looking around)
I don't think so.
[Mitchell tries to move past Vashin, but he blocks the way. Mitchell
knocks him down, then gets into a fight with two other guards. One
knocks Mitchell down with a roundhouse punch.]
INT--HA'TAK THRONE ROOM
NETAN
I asked not to be disturbed.
[Vashin appears, slightly bloody and out of breath.]
VASHIN
I apologize, Netan, but there's been an incident.
[Netan looks up. Two guards drag Mitchell into the throne room. He has
a handkerchief over his face, ostensibly stopping the flow of blood.
Netan approaches them. As he draws close, Mitchell falls forward, his
hand darting out. He pricks Netan's left arm with the ring, tearing
Netan's sleeve as the guards dragged him back out of reach.]
MITCHELL
I tried to tell them who I was, but apparently the name Kefflin
didn't seem to mean much around here.
[From Netan's perspective, the man his people are holding is Kefflin, a
man with long straight blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, and dark
eyes. Netan glances at his torn sleeve.]
MITCHELL (APPEARING AS KEFFLIN)
Sorry about that. The ring was a gift from my latest...conquest.
[Mitchell/Kefflin smiles and shows his sharp ring to Netan. Netan
considers all this, then smiles and embraces Mitchell, slapping him on
the back.]
NETAN
(laughing)
My dear friend Kefflin is here and you didn't inform me?
VASHIN
I'm sorry, master. You asked not to be disturbed.
NETAN
So you beat him instead?
MITCHELL
As you can see, the beating wasn't...entirely one way.
[Netan laughs and clasps both sides of Mitchell's face.]
NETAN
I'm sure it wasn't.
(to guards)
Leave us.
[The guards leave with sideways glances at Mitchell. Mitchell adjusts
his ring on his right hand and walks further into the room.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Anateo stands at the front of the bridge, staring out the window.
Solek approaches.]
ANATEO
What?
SOLEK
It is not too late to turn this ship over to Netan. You would be a
hero.
ANATEO
You know I cannot do that. Netan has failed the Alliance. And his
position as leader hangs precariously by a thread. He knows I am his
most worthy challenger, but he could not very well just murder me in
cold blood, so he sent us on a fool's quest.
SOLEK
But we succeeded.
ANATEO
Yes. And this is going to ensure the downfall of Netan.
SOLEK
But why was it necessary to also bait a trap to capture SG-1?
ANATEO
Because everyone knows that they have caused us more grief than any
other adversary, including the Ori. All the seconds, including me,
have begged Netan to go after them, but he refused. He's a coward,
choosing to run and hide rather than face the wrath of the Tau'ri.
SOLEK
Will we not?
ANATEO
We have brought their battleship to its knees, what are they going
to do? After I present Odyssey and SG-1 to the others, Netan's
stuffed corpse will be a trophy on my wall, and control of the
Lucian Alliance will be mine.
[Anateo sits in the commander's chair, satisfied.]
INT--HA'TAK CORRIDORS
[Netan and Mitchell walk the corridors.]
NETAN
It's been a disappointing season, my friend. Drought and floods have
ravaged our highest yielding kassa plantations. The armies of the
Ori continue to usurp the planets upon which we've established
trade. And of course, there's the Tau'ri.
MITCHELL
Yes. Committing our ships to cooperate in a fight against the Ori
incursion was a strategic mistake.
[Netan stops walking. After a few steps, Mitchell notices and stops as
well.]
MITCHELL
You've always appreciated my honesty in the past.
[Netan starts walking again.]
NETAN
I have.
MITCHELL
You're the boss. I don't blame you, but others do.
NETAN
I know.
INT--CARGO SHIP
[Teal'c listens to Mitchell's transmission of his conversation with
Netan.]
NETAN
(over transmission)
Is that why you're here? The Kefflin I know would never make such a
trip without a serious purpose.
MITCHELL
(over transmission)
Actually, it's the Odyssey...
[The rest of the transmission is drowned out by static and a loud hum
from the engines. An instant later, all power goes out in the cargo
ship.]
EXT--SPACE
[The cargo ship decloaks with a lot of crackling electricity.]
INT--HA'TAK CORRIDOR
MITCHELL
(continuing)
...the Tau'ri vessel. Word reached me you just captured it. I wanted
to know your plans. Its beaming and hyperspace technology could be a
great advantage in transporting my crops.
NETAN
(cautiously)
Where did you hear this?
MITCHELL
Usual channels.
NETAN
I heard rumors that the Odyssey was destroyed in battle with the
Ori. Nothing has been confirmed yet. I certainly had nothing to do
with it.
[Vashin approaches.]
VASHIN
Netan, a ship has been detected in proximity. We are moving to
intercept.
INT--HA'TAK BRIG AND VICINITY
[Several Lucian Alliance guards escort Vashin, Netan, and Mitchell to
the brig chamber. When the door opens, Teal'c stands there. His arms
straddle a horizontal bar across his back, and his wrists are shackled
to the bar by a short chain. Mitchell schools his expression to not
show his concern.]
NETAN
(chuckling)
Teal'c. I'm beginning to think you enjoy being my prisoner.
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey drifts in space, burn damage to its hull evident.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Carter glances over to see if the guards are paying attention to her.
They are not, so she presses a few keys. There is a small power surge.
The guards glance over.]
CARTER
Sorry. I accidentally overloaded a power coupling.
INT--ODYSSEY CARGO BAY
[A hatch door beside Vala opens. Vala looks over at Marks, who signals
the all clear. Vala and Daniel casually move towards the door. Other
crew members gather closer, appearing to talk casually to each other
while grouped to hide Vala and Daniel's movements.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Carter glances behind her again. The guards are still talking amongst
themselves. She lets out a breath of relief.]
EXT--SPACE
[Three ha'taks float in hyperspace.]
INT--NETAN'S HA'TAK BRIG
[Vashin proceeds to beat Teal'c, hitting him in the abdomen and face.
Mitchell and Netan look on.]
VASHIN
Where is the rest of your team!?!
[Frustrated, Vashin strikes Teal'c again, then reaches for a Goa'uld
pain stick. Mitchell snarls and grabs the stick, beating Vashin with it
and then using it on him as he collapses to the floor. Mitchell glances
at the device, then twirls it under his arm.]
MITCHELL
That man knows nothing of torture. I'll find what we need.
NETAN
(smiling)
I was wondering how long you'd be able to resist.
[To Netan's eyes, Kefflin is speaking to him.]
MITCHELL (APPEARING AS KEFFLIN)
If you don't mind, I'm going to need some time alone with him.
[Netan gestures with his head, and the guards drag Vashin out.
Mitchell, as Kefflin, approaches Teal'c and studies him before moving
back towards Netan. The doors close.]
[Once they're alone, Mitchell sets the pain stick down and starts
looking around the back wall for a panel.]
MITCHELL
All right, we have to find a way to get you out of here.
TEAL'C
Have you found the location of the Odyssey?
MITCHELL
Not yet. And I don't think Netan knows where it is either. And he's
definitely having some trouble with his "seconds".
TEAL'C
Then you must maintain this ruse.
MITCHELL
No. Teal'c. Not at your expense. No.
TEAL'C
There are other lives at stake, Mitchell!
[Mitchell raises his fist in frustration and almost responds, then
reconsiders and straightens his tunic. He grabs the pain stick.]
MITCHELL
Fine. Just remember, I am an expert torturer.
[Mitchell touches the pain stick to the wall of the chamber. Teal'c
lets out a bellow as if he is in pain.]
INT--JUST OUTSIDE BRIG
[The two Lucian guards just outside the brig chamber hear Teal'c's
screams and exchange looks before facing front again.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[A Lucian officer, Teresh, notes the unusual gathering of the Odyssey
crew in the cargo hold from the video surveillance.]
TERESH
Something's going on in the hold. Go do a head count.
[The guard with him starts to leave, but is downed by a zat. Before
Teresh can react, he too is zatted. Daniel and Vala look around for any
other Lucian Alliance members before heading to the controls.]
INT--HA'TAK DINING ROOM
[Netan and his seconds are eating a large feast when Mitchell enters
the room. Netan notices him immediately.]
NETAN
Vashin, make room.
[Vashin sullenly rises from his place at the table and stands against
the wall. Mitchell takes his seat and pulls some food closer to him.]
NETAN
(to others)
This is Kefflin.
GAVOS
(suspiciously)
I thought you did not like to show your face.
[Mitchell picks up a knife and studies it before piercing a piece of
food.]
MITCHELL
I'm seeing a therapist.
NETAN
(smirking)
This is Gavos.
(he nods around the table)
Slaviash, Karug, Millic, and Rameris.
GAVOS
What did you learn from the Jaffa?
MITCHELL
(casually eating)
Apparently, the rumors are true. The Odyssey is still out there, in
the hands of Anateo. The Tau'ri are in possession of an audio
recording which indicates that he's in control of it.
[Gavos, Netan, and Slaviash give each other suspicious looks. Mitchell
glances up as he's about to take a drink, seemingly only upon the
pregnant silence becoming aware of the reaction to his words.]
NETAN
(clenching his jaw)
I ordered the attack on the Odyssey.
[Gavos rolls his eyes and looks stricken.]
NETAN
It is time the Tau'ri were sent a message.
[Netan spares a momentary glare at Mitchell.]
GAVOS
Where is the ship?
NETAN
I don't know. Anateo has betrayed us.
SLAVIASH
(amused)
Are you saying he succeeded in capturing the ship?
[Netan reaches for his cup.]
NETAN
(biting off his words)
He hasn't reported in yet.
GAVOS
The Tau'ri vessel is most powerful. You could not have possibly
expected him to survive!
[Mitchell casually knifes another cube of meat and eats it, watching
the exchange.]
NETAN
I gave him a strategy that vastly improved his odds.
[Gavos shifts uncomfortably in his chair.]
NETAN
(continuing)
He came to me several months ago demanding more territory as his
planets had been overrun by the armies of the Ori. He suggested that
he eliminate...you, Karug, take over your planets.
[Karug shifts and his seat and looks upset. Gavos and Slaviash exchange
looks and start laughing heartily.]
MITCHELL
(deadpan)
Anateo hasn't just captured the Odyssey. He's using it to bait a
trap for SG-1.
[Gavos and Slaviash instantly sober.]
SLAVIASH
He has lost his mind. The Tau'ri will declare all out war on us!
GAVOS
You should've consulted with us, Netan.
[Netan stands, unhostering his sidearm. He shoots Gavos in the chest.
Gavos falls backward in his chair with a cry. Everyone sits back
warily.]
NETAN
(brandishing his weapon)
I need not consult with anyone! Now is there anyone else who wants
to challenge me?
[Netan looks at his seconds, his eyes wild and dangerous, his hand
still brandishing his sidearm. The seconds all avert their eyes from
him.]
NETAN
Anateo betrayed us all, and he will pay. And as for the Tau'ri, they
were already at war with us and us with them, and I will not cower
in fear. So spread the word. Send all available ships. I want the
Odyssey found. NOW!
[He shakes the table, and the seconds hurriedly stand and leave the
room. Mitchell moves more slowly.]
NETAN
Kefflin.
[Mitchell turns around and walks back over as the doors close. They
both look down at Gavos' corpse.]
NETAN
Was it really necessary to embarrass me like that?
MITCHELL
There have been whispers lately concerning the strength of your
leadership. I suspect...those whispers will now stop.
[Netan considers this and nods slightly.]
NETAN
For the time being.
MITCHELL
You'll need someone to supervise Gavos' territory.
[Netan looks over and smiles slightly.]
NETAN
Your cut will be twenty percent.
[Netan reholsters his weapon. Mitchell nods and leaves.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Daniel hovers over Vala's chair as she sits at the port station,
playing with the controls. He appears frustrated. Vala waves him away
as she concentrates, and they talk over each other.]
VALA
(shooing him)
Phsst.
DANIEL
Come on.
VALA
I'm working as fast as I can.
DANIEL
You stole Prometheus all by yourself.
VALA
I know. The systems are all new!
DANIEL
You said you could do it. We do not exactly have a whole lot of
time!
VALA
No, Sam warned us that a number of the arrays had been damaged. Even
with the locators, beaming a person from one room to another within
the ship is very risky. Do you want them to rematerialize between
the decks?
[Daniel grimaces and nods in grudging concession of her point.]
ANATEO
(over radio)
Teresh, this is Anateo. You missed your check-in. Report.
[Daniel and Vala freeze. They both look over at the unconscious
Teresh.]
INT--ODYSSEY CARGO HOLD
[Solek and guards storm into the cargo hold. He shoves a female crew
member.]
SOLEK
Move!
[He approaches Marks, who stands at attention in front of the access
door through which Daniel and Vala escaped.]
SOLEK
Where are they? Doctor Jackson and Vala?
[Marks stubbornly sets his jaw and refuses to answer. Solek snarls and
shoves Marks aside. He shoves one final airman away before opening the
access hatch door easily. Solek scowls and keys his radio.]
SOLEK
(into radio)
Anateo, we've got a problem.
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Carter braces in her chair at one of the control room access panels as
Anateo approaches her, aiming his sidearm. When he reaches the panel,
he keys the intercom.]
ANATEO
Doctor Jackson? Vala?
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Daniel and Vala look upset as Anateo's voice echoes through the
speakers.]
ANATEO
(over intercom)
Just wanted to let you know that your duplicity has already
forfeited Colonel Carter's life. Unless you surrender immediately,
the rest of the crew is next.
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Carter glares stone-faced at Anateo as he points the weapon at her.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
VALA
I can't be sure.
DANIEL
(wincing)
Do it anyway.
[Vala does a double-take at Daniel, then looks away and bites her lip.]
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
No one else is going to fix this ship.
ANATEO
I think it's pretty clear that you've just been stalling and that
you're not really going to fix it for me anyway. I'm just going to
have to figure it out for myself.
[Carter swallows, but maintains her calm demeanor. An instant later,
the Odyssey Asgard beams activate and beam Anateo out of the room.
Carter slumps back in her chair and gasps in relief.]
CARTER
Good enough.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Vala gets out of her chair and walks towards the front of the bride.
She stuffs her hands in the back pockets of her pants and lets out a
lazy huff of breath. Daniel looks around the bridge curiously and joins
her.]
DANIEL
Uh...where is she?
VALA
Well, I couldn't be sure, so I just beamed out the only other life
sign in the room instead.
DANIEL
Okay. Where is he?
[Vala lazily looks out the front window. Daniel follows her gaze.
Anateo drifts in space nearby, firing his weapon at the window.]
DANIEL
(casually)
Well, Sam did say it was risky.
VALA
Hmm.
[Vala waves at Anateo as he drifts closer, eventually impacting the
window and drifting up out of sight.]
VALA
When she's right, she's right.
DANIEL
(nodding in agreement)
Mmm-hmm.
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey drifts aimlessly, listing towards its bow.]
INT--ODYSSEY AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
[Various crew members, including Marks, Carter, and Vala work to get
systems back online. Carter sits at one of the stations. Vala walks
over to her carrying an open laptop.]
VALA
Only fifty percent of the shield emitters are responding.
CARTER
Okay, we need to get them back online and get the hull integrity
back within acceptable parameters. The hyperdrive is our priority.
[Daniel enters the room.]
DANIEL
Well, we think most of Anateo's men have been accounted for.
CARTER
Most?
DANIEL
Yeah, we swept the ship twice. Rounded up fourteen men in total, but
not Solek. Vala had to beam him out of the hold where the crew was
being held, so we have no way of knowing for sure where he ended up.
VALA
Did you check the sewage reservoir?
DANIEL
Yeah, no lifesigns. Ew. How's it going here?
CARTER
Well, no shields, no weapons, no communications, and at least a day
out for hyperdrive.
DANIEL
So, we're sitting ducks.
CARTER
(nodding in agreement)
Mm-hmm.
INT--HA'TAK BRIG
[Netan enters Teal'c's cell. Mitchell stands in front of Teal'c, whose
head is drooped in either real or feigned exhaustion.]
NETAN
Kefflin, what are you doing?
MITCHELL
Interrogating the prisoner further.
[Netan clenches his jaw.]
NETAN
And what have you learned?
[Mitchell glances at Teal'c, whose head remains bowed. Mitchell steps
forward.]
MITCHELL
Not much yet.
NETAN
(grimacing)
Fine. Then we can kill him together.
[Teal'c lifts his head and glares. Mitchell shifts, nonplussed.]
MITCHELL
Kill him?
NETAN
We've learned all we can. Anateo has left us no choice. And I am
committed to sending a message to the Tau'ri.
[Mitchell feigns unconcern as he fingers the pain stick on the table
next to him.]
MITCHELL
Netan, I have to admit...I was just beginning to enjoy this one.
[Netan chuckles and unholsters his sidearm.]
NETAN
I'm sorry, my old friend. Your fun is over.
[Netan begins to aim his weapon. Mitchell grips the pain stick.]
VASHIN
(unseen)
Netan!
[Vashin runs in, out of breath.]
VASHIN
The Odyssey has been found.
[Netan smiles at Mitchell. Teal'c glares and straightens to his full
height.]
INT--HA'TAK RING ROOM AND VICINITY
[Netan, Mitchell, and Vashin enter the ring room from a nearby
corridor. Tenat is already there, standing within the rings. Mitchell
stops short when he spots Tenat, and surreptitiously turns aside,
rubbing his forehead to hide his face.]
NETAN
Tenat, welcome. This is my good friend, Kefflin.
[Tenat turns away from Netan to look at Mitchell. Mitchell continues to
scratch his nose and shifts to face mostly away from Tenat to hide his
features as much as possible. Tenat cocks his head, then bows
slightly.]
TENAT
It is my pleasure. I have heard a great deal about you...Kefflin.
MITCHELL
(looking away)
Yeah, likewise.
NETAN
Tell me what you have learned, Tenat, and perhaps I will spare your
pathetic life.
TENAT
(obsequious)
Ha ha. Funny as always, Netan. As you suspected, the Odyssey was
never destroyed. Anateo betrayed you and kept it for himself.
NETAN
Where is it?
TENAT
Half a day's journey. Maybe less. I have transmitted the coordinates
to your bridge.
NETAN
Get to your ship. We'll travel together.
TENAT
Of course.
[Netan and Vashin exit through a different door. Mitchell moves to
follow. When the others are out of sight and Mitchell is almost out the
door, Tenat calls out.]
TENAT
Wait just a moment...Cam Mitchell.
[Mitchell winces. He turns around, feigning casual unconcern.]
MITCHELL
Look, I don't know who you think I am...
[He turns to go, but Tenat's voice stops him once again.]
TENAT
You are Cam Mitchell. Bounty hunter. You double-crossed me and my
partner Jup.
[Mitchell turns to face Tenat again. He beckons Tenat over with his
finger, and Tenat moves closer. Mitchell looks around to ensure no one
is listening and leans close.]
MITCHELL
What do you want?
TENAT
I do not know how you've managed to convince Netan that you are
Kefflin, but you are obviously up to something big here. I will take
half.
MITCHELL
And what about your loyalty to Netan?
TENAT
He will kill me the instant I am no longer of use to him.
MITCHELL
And Jup, your old partner? Where's he?
TENAT
(conspiratorially)
He is working elsewhere at the moment. We need not worry about
cutting him in.
MITCHELL
Fine. Ten percent. It'll be big. Trust me.
TENAT
Thirty percent, or I tell Netan you are not who you say you are.
MITCHELL
Twenty-five percent, no more. I'll ring over to your ship before
this one jumps to hyperspace and fill you in on the details.
[Mitchell uses his right hand to clap Tenat on the arm before walking
away. Tenat looks down at his arm, then back at the departing Mitchell
and smiles.]
INT--HA'TAK BRIG AND VICINITY
[Mitchell approaches the guards outside Teal'c's cell. He carries a
zat.]
MITCHELL
Unchain the prisoner. He's coming with me.
[The two guards enter Teal'c's cell. Teal'c is seated but still
shackled as before. The guards release the shackles. Teal'c gives an
almost imperceptible sigh of relief as he rubs the circulation back
into his wrists. He looks down the hall, catching Mitchell's
attention.]
[Vashin strides into view. When Vashin looks up, Teal'c grabs the guard
on either side of him and smashes their heads together. They fall
limply to the floor. Teal'c leaps over one of the fallen guards and
attacks Vashin, knocking him to floor and striking him repeatedly.
Mitchell checks to make sure the guards are no threat before calling to
his teammate.]
MITCHELL
Teal'c. Teal'c!
[Realizing Teal'c cannot hear him through his bloodlust, Mitchell
approaches and grabs Teal'c by the shoulder. Teal'c reacts to the
movement behind him by grabbing his "assailant" by the throat and
shoving him into the wall. Teal'c still has his arm ready to punch
someone, but stops himself when he sees he holds Mitchell. Mitchell
grabs Teal'c's shoulder partly in defense, and partly in reassurance.]
TEAL'C
I have grown weary of this torture, Colonel Mitchell.
MITCHELL
(whispering)
That's pretty obvious...but right now, we gotta go.
[Teal'c gently releases his grip on Mitchell's throat. Mitchell claps
Teal'c on the back of the neck in a comforting gesture. Teal'c calms
further and holds out his hand. Mitchell slaps his zat gun into it.
Teal'c starts walking away. Mitchell follows, pausing only to retrieve
Vashin's sidearm.]
INT--HA'TAK CORRIDORS
[Teal'c and Mitchell cautiously move through the corridors.]
MITCHELL
You remember Tenat?
[Teal'c looks over in surprise.]
MITCHELL
Yeah, as in Jup and Tenat. Well, he somehow weaseled his way into
commanding an Alliance mothership. And check this out, the
incompetent twit actually found the Odyssey.
[Teal'c looks at Mitchell in disbelief.]
TEAL'C
Did he see you?
MITCHELL
Yep, recognized me as well, but he's keeping his mouth shut because
he figures I'm scamming Netan and he wants a piece of the action. We
have to get over to his ship before this one jumps to hyperspace.
TEAL'C
What is your plan?
MITCHELL
Eh, I'm making it up as I go along.
EXT--SPACE
[Netan and Tenat's ha'taks enter hyperspace.]
INT--BRIDGE, TENAT'S HA'TAK
[Tenat sits on the throne. Another Oranian is at the helm. Yet a third
Oranian enters.]
ORANIAN
Tenat...Netan is here to see you.
TENAT
What?
[Tenat rises. He looks over and sees Netan entering the room.]
TENAT
Netan...
NETAN
I know of your intention to deceive me.
TENAT
How did you...
NETAN
I knew Colonel Mitchell was impersonating Kefflin all along.
TENAT
(confused)
Colonel Mitchell?
NETAN
Of SG-1! I caught him and Teal'c trying to leave my ship.
TENAT
(equivocating)
No, Netan, you are mistaken. It's true, I knew he wasn't Kefflin.
But...I was merely trying to lure him here, so I could turn him over
to you.
[He looks over to see Netan smiling at him, but it is not a pleasant
smile.]
NETAN
That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard!
[Tenat gasps, he drops to his knees and raises his hands, his whole
body quivering.]
TENAT
(panicking)
Please...don't kill me!
[Netan snorts in disgust.]
NETAN
Get up. You pathetic excuse for a...whatever you are.
TENAT
What are you going to do to me?
NETAN
(dismissively)
Nothing for the moment.
TENAT
Oh, thank you. You are a generous and gracious man. I say that all
the time, don't I, men? Tell them how honored you are to finally
meet him in person.
[Tenat watches Netan closely, who seems unimpressed. The other two
Oranians glance over then return to their duties. The hyperspace window
can be seen through the viewing screen.]
NETAN
Shut up! Stop snivelling.
[Tenat continues to gasp nervously.]
EXT--SPACE
[Odyssey continues to drift in space as a hyperspace window opens
nearby. The two ha'taks appear in front of the vessel.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Marks and the starboard officer are at their stations. Other crew
members are still conducting repairs. Daniel looks at laptop in the
rear part of the bridge.]
MARKS
Doctor Jackson?
[Daniel comes over to Marks' station.]
MARKS
If these sensors are working properly, two Goa'uld motherships just
emerged from hyperspace and are closing in.
[Daniel looks up worriedly. As he watches, the two ha'taks can be seen
approaching through the front window. Daniel gets into the commander's
chair, shifting in it uncomfortably and adjusting his long coat. He
glances over at Marks before keying the communicator at the arm of the
chair.]
DANIEL
(into comm, nervously)
Uh, Sam?
CARTER
(over comm)
Go ahead.
DANIEL
(into comm)
We may need that hyperdrive a little ahead of schedule.
INT--ENGINE ROOM
[Carter and Vala work on either side of a crystal control panel.]
CARTER
(nonplussed)
How ahead of schedule?
DANIEL
(over radio)
In about ten seconds would be good. We've got company.
[Carter and Vala exchange worried looks before turning back to their
work.]
CARTER
(into comm)
We need more time. Can you stall?
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
DANIEL
(weakly into comm)
We're about to find out.
(to Marks)
What's our shield status?
MARKS
Less than thirty percent.
DANIEL
Weapons?
MARKS
Rail guns are online. But we don't have missiles yet. One of the
ships is hailing us.
[Daniel turns the chair to face the comm screen. He looks very
ill-at-ease and nervous in his position. He clears his throat and
points at the side screen.]
DANIEL
Onscreen.
[Marks looks at Daniel for a moment before activating the comm. Netan
appears on the screen.]
NETAN
(surprised, on comm)
Doctor Jackson.
[Daniel rubs his eyes with one hand then points at Netan in a friendly
manner, grinning with false brightness.]
DANIEL
Oh, right! Hi...hi, how are you?
[Marks continues facing the comm screen, but raises his eyebrows and
glances back with his eyes towards Daniel.]
NETAN
(on video comm)
I was expecting Anateo.
DANIEL
Y-yes, he was here for a while, but then he...had to go...
[Daniel gestures casually away towards the front window and gives a
half-hearted laugh.]
NETAN
(on videoscreen)
Your ship is battered. My scans tell me your shield strength is low,
and if you had hyperdrive, you would've left long ago. Surrender
now, or be destroyed.
DANIEL
Right...Okey-dokey.
(he takes a deep breath)
We surrender.
[He shrugs innocently.]
NETAN
(on videoscreen)
Prepare to be boarded.
DANIEL
Yeah, that-that's where you're going to run into a bit of a problem.
You see, our-our rings are damaged, and as you yourself pointed out,
our shields are down, which means atmosphere in the 302 bays is
unsustainable...
[He pauses and glances to see how Netan is taking this news. Netan
appears irritated.]
DANIEL
I-I-I mean, I just don't see how we're gonna get your guys over
here, unless you want me to try...beaming you over?
[His expression is no longer innocent as he stares daringly at Netan.
Netan curls his lip and shuts off the videolink.]
[Marks studies his monitor.]
MARKS
They're powering weapons.
[Daniel clutches the comm on the armrest, activating it.]
DANIEL
(into comm)
Sam, I think I've stalled as long as I can.
INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE ROOM
CARTER

We need more time.
DANIEL

Too late.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
DANIEL
(gestures to Marks, distractedly)
Uh, you should probably prepare to return fire.
MARKS
For the record, I'm always prepared. I just have to press this
button here.
[Daniel looks at Marks in surprise as Marks points at a button on his
console.]
DANIEL
Right...I just--I thought that's what you're supposed to say, so...
MARKS
I know.
INT--BRIDGE, TENAT'S HA'TAK
"NETAN"
Open fire on the other ha'tak vessel.
TENAT
What?
"NETAN"
You heard me.
TENAT
But...?
[Tenat looks at Netan, who grabs his tunic and pulls him close.]
"NETAN"
You dare question my tactics? There's a ship full of traitors out
there waiting to unseat me as leader of the Lucian Alliance. Fire
now!
(he releases Tenat)
You shall be richly rewarded with vast territories to command.
TENAT
(to helmsman)
Fire on the other ha'tak vessel.
[The helmsman nods and presses some controls.]
EXT--SPACE
[One ha'tak begins to fire on the other, impacting its shields.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Marks' monitor shows the weapon fire.]
MARKS
One of the motherships is firing at the other. Receiving radio
signal.

face.]

Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Do you copy?
DANIEL
(into comm)
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Daniel Jackson. It is good to hear your voice. Colonel Mitchell and
I are on board one of the motherships. Request that you beam us
aboard the Odyssey immediately.
DANIEL
(nodding towards Marks frantically)
Yeah.
MARKS
Locking on their locator beacons.
INT--BRIDGE, TENAT'S HA'TAK
[The real Netan appears on a video communication link before Tenat and
everyone on his bridge. Netan is livid.]
NETAN
(over comm)
What are you doing?!?
TENAT
(confused)
Netan? What? How?
[He looks next to him. Mitchell stands there, where he has been
impersonating Netan all this time since enabling the deception by
pricking him in Netan's ring room.]
ORANIAN HELMSMAN
(gesturing to Mitchell)
I thought this was Netan.
[Mitchell grins and waves at Tenat before being beamed away. The
Oranians exchange shocked looks.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Teal'c and Mitchell are beamed onto the bridge.]
MITCHELL
Jackson. What are you doing sitting there?
DANIEL
What are you wearing?
[Mitchell looks down at his Lucian Alliance uniform and straightens his
tunic.]
MITCHELL
Oh, it's a...long story.
INT--BRIDGE, TENAT'S HA'TAK
NETAN
(over comm)
You are the biggest fool in TWO galaxies!
[Netan ends the transmission.]
TENAT
But Netan, I...
[He and the other Oranians exchange looks.]
TENAT
(shaking his head)
I screwed up.
INT--ODYSSEY ENGINE ROOM
[Vala picks up a small, stubby crystal in desperation. Carter shakes
her head.]
CARTER
It's the wrong one! You can't just jam it in!
[Vala jams in the small crystal. The power grid activates. Carter
stares at it in surprise.]
CARTER
How did you do that?
VALA
Honestly? I don't know. That almost never normally works.
[She looks back at Carter with smug grin. Carter scoffs and shakes her
head.]
CARTER
(into comm)
Daniel, try it now.
EXT--SPACE
[While the two ha'taks exchange weapons fire with each other, Odyssey
jumps into hyperspace.]
INT--BRIDGE, TENAT'S HA'TAK
[Explosions rock the ship.]
ORANIAN HELMSMAN
Shield failure is imminent.
TENAT
Damn you...Cam Mitchell!
EXT--SPACE
[Tenat's ha'tak explodes.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Odyssey flies through hyperspace.]
INT--ODYSSEY CORRIDORS
[Daniel and Mitchell, now both dressed in black BDUs, walk through the
corridor.]
DANIEL
You know, you're very lucky that no one else on the bridge of that
ship knew what Netan looked like.
MITCHELL
Yeah, it was a gamble. But I figured if I got made or if that
chemical jab on Tenat didn't work after a half an hour, I'd take the
bridge by force. I had a pissed off Jaffa waiting to help me out.
[Carter and Vala, both wearing black BDUs, step out of a room and meet
their teammates, who stop walking.]
CARTER
Where's Teal'c?
DANIEL
Ah, he's in the infirmary.
MITCHELL
Yeah, big boy got banged up a bit.
VALA
Oh. Hey, what happened? How'd you get the Lucian Alliance to fire on
each other?
MITCHELL
Oh, you'll love this...
CARTER
(interrupting)
Um, before you tell us. I got long-range communications back online
and sent a message to Earth telling them that we'll be coming home.
MITCHELL
Yeah, you should probably add that we have officially declared war
on the Lucian Alliance.
[The team exchange grave looks.]
CARTER
(somberly)
I did.
FADE OUT
