Merlin's prophecy: Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei.

INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Vala and Carter join Mitchell at the base of the ramp. The wormhole is
active. Teal'c steps through the incoming wormhole. He is dressed in
high council Jaffa robes.]
TEAL'C
(somber)
Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori. Two are Jaffa strongholds.
They attempted to resist, but were overwhelmed within a matter of
hours.
(moving to Vala)
According to those who witnessed the battle, the enemy is led by a
young woman of extraordinary powers.
[Vala looks shaken.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28
[Teal'c, Carter, Mitchell and Vala walk out of the gate room and down
the hall.]
MITCHELL
Six planets in eight days, and they don't even have their full team
in the field yet.
CARTER
Why haven't they made a move against Earth?
TEAL'C
In all probability, the Ancient device in Antarctica is giving them
pause.
MITCHELL
At least until the rest of their battle fleet gets here.
DANIEL
(yelling from another corridor)
I got it!
[Daniel runs around the corner, carrying a book.]
DANIEL
(breathless)
I got it! I made the connection! Sir Gawain to Gwalchmei. Culwhch
and Olwen. Verus Gen Bree.
[Daniel looks at his teammates, excited. The others exchange confused
looks.]
CARTER
(to Mitchell)
And you say I'm hard to understand.
DANIEL
(realizing)
Oh-oh! It's--it's Vagonbrei. One of the planets Arthur and his
knights went to in their quest for the Holy Grail. I got the gate
address.
[Everyone looks very interested.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry, Mitchell, Teal'c, Carter, and Vala sit around the table.
Daniel walks around the table carrying a file before taking his seat
between Mitchell and Vala.]
DANIEL
While on PX1-767, we got the names of three planets: Castiana,
Sahal, and Vagonbrei. Three possible destinations for Arthur and his
knights in their quest for the Holy Grail, what we know to be
Merlin's weapon. Unfortunately, what we didn't get were any
corresponding gate addresses, and the process of going through that
library page by page looking for clues could have potentially taken
years. So, I knew we were going to have to narrow the search
parameters a little. That's when it hit me: Sir Gawain.
[Vala opens a book to marked page and hands it to Daniel with a smile.
He takes it and holds it to show the others an illustration.]
MITCHELL
Wasn't he one of the Knights who says "Ni"?
DANIEL
He was a Knight of the Round Table. In one of his earliest
incarnations, an old Welsh tale, he went on a quest to help rescue a
lost love. The legend says that Sir Gawain, AKA Gwalchmei, visited
several lands over the course of his adventure, including a place
called Gwlad Gan Brenhinol Gwir, which is Welsh for "Land of Royal
Truth". Translate that into Ancient, and you get "Verus Gen
Bree"--Vagonbrei.
CARTER
So, how does that get us a gate address?
[While Daniel begins to speak, Vala opens another old book to a marked
page and passes it over to him.]
DANIEL
Uh, it doesn't. But it did give me something very specific to look
for in Merlin's library, namely references to Gawain. Now, based on
this information, I started scanning through the titles, and I found
this. Now, the entire volume is dedicated to Gawain's adventures and
includes several very interesting illustrations, including a
depiction of a sword he once carried. Note the symbols engraved on
the blade.
[Daniel passes the book over to Landry, who traces his finger down the
illustration of the blade.]
LANDRY
(excited)
A gate address.
MITCHELL
(muttering)
Vagonbrei.
DANIEL
(pleased)
Well, we won't know until we check it out.
LANDRY
Well done, Doctor. Colonel Carter, what's the status of the Ori
Supergate?
CARTER
Any attempts we've made to dial out to the Ori galaxy have failed.
It looks like they're blocking us from their end.
TEAL'C
There is a mothership in the area that will alert us to the arrival
of any other ships.
LANDRY
(standing)
More ships? We can hardly deal with the ones that are already here!
You have a go. Find that weapon.
[Mitchell and Carter stand when Landry does.]
CARTER
Yes, sir.
VALA
(smiling)
Will do.
[She starts gathering up the books.]
LANDRY
(coldly)
I was talking to SG-1. You're not going anywhere.
[Landry exits to his office. Vala looks hurt.]
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Landry stands in his darkened office, flipping through a file. There
is a knock on the door, and Daniel enters without waiting for approval.
Landry looks to see who is there, then turns back to his file. Daniel
shuts the door behind him.]
DANIEL
(hesitantly)
General, I'm hoping you might reconsider your decision and allow
Vala to come with us.
[Landry raises his eyebrows and moves over to his desk to sit with the
file.]
LANDRY
Given everything she's put you through, you're the last person I
would've expected to ask me that!
DANIEL
Yes, sir. And I'm hoping that impresses on you just how strongly I
feel about this.
[Landry sighs.]
DANIEL
(with a loud sigh)
Look, I know she's no angel. She's-she's lied, she's stolen, she's
cheated, she's misrepresented herself, she's...lied. But she also
risked her life to warn us that the Ori were on their way, and
almost sacrificed herself to shut down the very first Ori Supergate.
LANDRY
I understand the contributions she's made. The truth is, the
Pentagon isn't willing to roll the dice on her.
DANIEL
(with persuasive tone)
But you could convince them otherwise.
[Landry stops reading his report and gives Daniel a measured look.]
DANIEL
You-you see, ten years ago, General Hammond sat in that very chair,
and he was faced with a...similar decision. As former First Prime to
Apophis, Teal'c had committed some terrible crimes.
[Landry appears unmoved and resumes flipping through his report.],
LANDRY
(sighing)
As the former First Prime to Apophis, Teal'c provided valuable
insight to the enemy's resources and tactics.
DANIEL
And as the mother to the leader of the Ori army, Vala may hold the
key to stopping them.
LANDRY
If I push this issue, and the Pentagon agrees to let her join you on
offworld missions, then I'd be the one ultimately held accountable
for her actions.
DANIEL
(wincing)
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
[Daniel sighs and starts to leave. Landry continues to flip through his
report.]
LANDRY
So, I'd be counting on you...to keep her in line.
[Daniel pauses at the door, surprised.]
DANIEL
Yes, sir.
[Daniel exits. After he's gone, Landry looks up and gives a musing
smile.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Daniel is geared up to go offworld as he exits a room. Vala bounces
just outside, wearing a green BDU jumpsuit.]
VALA
So...can I go on the mission?
DANIEL
No. You're not cleared for offworld travel yet. You still have to go
through a psych evaluation.
[They both walk through the corridor.]
VALA
What's that?
DANIEL
Uh, sort of an interview given to all prospective SGC personnel,
designed to assess a person's psychological state, uh, get a sense
of their mental well-being.
VALA
Oooh, to find out if I'm...
(Vala splutters and waves her hands around)
Wonko.
DANIEL
(hesitantly)
Right. So, they're going to sit you down in a little room, get you
talking about yourself, and ask you a few questions.
VALA
So, it's a test?
DANIEL
Sort of.
VALA
And all I have to do is pass? How hard can that be?
[Daniel and Vala pause right outside the Gate room, Daniel grimaces.]
VALA
I'm going to have to do some research, so I'm gonna use your
computer while you're away on this mission.
[Vala starts to go back the way they came.]
DANIEL
(calling after her with increasing loudness)
You know what? I'd prefer if you didn't. There's a lot of sensitive
material in there, and I...
[Mitchell is heading down the hall, also dressed to go offworld. and
notes Vala passing him.]
VALA
(calling back)
Great! Uh...be careful!
MITCHELL
(to Daniel while passing)
Time to go.
[Mitchell continues walking into the Gate room, taking a P-90 from an
airman.]
DANIEL
(sputtering)
Eh, I said no! And you can't access it without my password!
VALA
Already got it! Thanks!
[Vala skips around the corner.]
DANIEL
I...the...but...!
[While Daniel stutters, Mitchell grabs the back of his vest and drags
him into the Gate room. Daniel continues to look forlornly back and
absently takes his P-90 from the airman as the Gate room door closes.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--VAGONBREI, DAY
[Leafless trees surround a darkened path and few structures. The
atmosphere is overcast and very foggy. SG-1 cautiously explores.]
MITCHELL
This place is deader than a Texas salad bar.
DANIEL
Hello? Hello!
[Teal'c moves a dry rotted wooden back to a park bench.]
TEAL'C
It is obvious this village has long since been abandoned.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Vala sits at the counter, using Daniel's computer and taking notes on
a pad of paper. Landry pauses by the door frame and knocks on door
jamb. Vala looks over and straightens.]
VALA
(surprised)
General! What brings you by?
[Landry enters.]
LANDRY
Just thought I'd see how you were getting along.
VALA
Huh.
LANDRY
What are you doing?
VALA
Just a little research for my upcoming mental appraisal.
LANDRY
(chuckling)
You can't cram for a psychiatric evaluation.
VALA
(muttering while taking notes)
That's what they want you to think.
(louder)
It's a battle of wits. My mind against theirs. They'll try and
confuse me with their trick questions, but I already have the
correct answers.
LANDRY
There are no correct answers.
VALA
(ignoring him)
For instance, when they ask me, "what do you consider your biggest
flaw..."
LANDRY
(shaking his head)
No, they won't ask that question.
VALA
(continuing)
My answer will be that I feel I am too much of a perfectionist.
(turns and grins)
You see, I...I, uh, put a positive spin on a negative.
LANDRY
(dryly)
Yes, that was very transparent.
VALA
Question two: "You are in the desert. You see a tortoise lying on
his back in the hot sun."
[Landry rolls his eyes and leaves. Vala is oblivious to his departure.]
VALA
(continuing)
"You recognize his plight but do nothing to help. Why?" Hmm. Why?
[She pauses for a few moments, then gasps in inspiration and begins to
write.]
VALA
(writing)
Because...you...are...also...a tortoise.
INT--PARLOR OF HOME, VAGONBREI
[SG-1 enter a home. A small parlor table is in the center. A few chairs
of simple design and tattered curtains decorate the room. Cobwebs are
everywhere. Daniel opens a door and moves into the next room. He soon
steps back out.]
DANIEL
Guys, you should, uh, take a look at this.
INT--BEDROOM, HOME IN VAGONBREI
[Daniel and Carter stand at the foot of the bed while Teal'c and
Mitchell look in from the doorway. Lying on the bed are the skeletal
remains of two people.]
MITCHELL
Whoa! I thought I liked to sleep in.
EXT--VAGONBREI, DAY
[Carter and Mitchell greet the Red team, a medical SGC team.]
CARTER
Dr. Reimer.
REIMER
(cheerfully)
Colonel Carter, Colonel Mitchell. I understand you've got a bit of a
medical mystery on your hands.
MITCHELL
What we have here is a village full of skeletons.
CARTER
We've found a few lying on the ground, but most seem to have died in
their beds. I think we can rule out violence.
REIMER
Anything left besides bones?
MITCHELL
Sorry, doc. Whatever happened here happened a long time ago.
REIMER
Let's go take a look.
INT--VAGONBREI ARCHIVES
[Daniel sits at a table taking notes from some books and parchment.
Teal'c walks over and takes a seat next to him]
TEAL'C
Did the village records give an indication as to what befell these
people?
DANIEL
No, but it does make mention to some of the ancient lore tied to the
area. See, according to legend, a cave overlooking the village was
once home to Morgan Le Fay.
[Daniel looks over at Teal'c in expectation, but Teal'c returns the
look with a blank expression. Daniel shakes his head, realizing Teal'c
doesn't understand.]
DANIEL
Ah, in Arthurian myth, Morgan was a powerful sorceress, King
Arthur's half-sister and an adversary of Merlin.
TEAL'C
That would suggest she may have had a hand in the disappearance of
the weapon we seek.
DANIEL
(thinking out loud)
Now Morgan, like Merlin, was a purported magic user, so it makes
sense that again, like Merlin, she was once ascended.
TEAL'C
One who foresaw the dangers presented to her and her kind by a
weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.
DANIEL
So she took the weapon from Merlin and went into hiding...
TEAL'C
...on three possible worlds. This being one.
DANIEL
(gravely)
We've got to find that cave.
EXT--VAGONBREI FOREST, DAY
[SG-1 and Ackerman walk through the forest, looking around carefully.]
ACKERMAN
(grumpily)
Why did I have to tag along on this little hike?
MITCHELL
You got somewhere else you need to be?
ACKERMAN
Yeah, at home in bed. I got pulled off inoculation duty on 865 to
come here and pull a double shift. I've been up eighteen hours
straight!
[Teal'c stops moving and looks around, concerned. Everyone else stops
and becomes more alert in reaction to Teal'c.]
DANIEL
What is it?
TEAL'C
Birds.
CARTER
What birds?
TEAL'C
My point exactly. I first noticed in the village and now here in the
forest as well--an unusual stillness. There are no birds, or any
other animal life for that matter.
MITCHELL
All right. So what happened to them?
[Mitchell leads the way, and they continue to cautiously move through
the forest.]
INT--SGC ISOLATION LAB
[Dr. Hutchison takes a drink of coffee. The door opens, and Vala
enters, coming sloppily to attention and saluting with a smile on her
face.]
HUTCHISON
Mmm. Vala. I'm Dr. Hutchison. Oh!
[Hutchison is surprised as Vala shakes his hand. She is very deliberate
in how she moves, grasping his hand and then slapping him on the
shoulder.]
HUTCHISON
Have a seat.
[They both sit at opposite ends of a small, metal table.]
HUTCHISON
So, how are you feeling?
VALA
Very well! Very well...well, you know, all things considered. Heh. I
mean, you'd assume I'd be a prime candidate for acculturation
difficulty, enduring feelings of...displacement and alienation.
Perhaps even a little paranoid ideation. Hmm?
[Hutchison sits back, nodding during her monologue.]
VALA
(conspiratorially leaning forward)
But the truth is, I was able to adopt an abstract attitude which
allowed me to...release some of my repressed feelings, ultimately
providing me with a cathartic actualization. How are you feeling?
HUTCHISON
(mildly)
I'm fine.
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN
[SG-1 explore a cavern. Ackerman naps on the ground.]
MITCHELL
There's nothing here.
DANIEL
Maybe it's the wrong cavern. We should continue searching the area.
CARTER
Uh, it's getting dark out there. We should head back to the village.
MITCHELL
Ackerman. Yo! Ackerman, wake up.
[Mitchell shines his flashlight in Ackerman's face and nudges him with
his boot.]
ACKERMAN
(groggily)
What happened?
MITCHELL
We're done. Sorry, Jackson.
[Ackerman slowly rises to his feet as SG-1 moves out. Daniel takes one
last look around the cave before leaving in frustration.]
INT--SGC ISOLATION LAB
HUTCHISON
Are you familiar with ink blot tests?
[Vala shakes her head innocently.]
HUTCHISON
Okay, I'm going to show you a series of images, and I just want you
to say the first thing that comes to your mind.
[Vala nods in excitement. Hutchison lifts the first inkblot. Vala
studies it a moment.]
VALA
Courage.
[Hutchison glances at the ink blot, then sets it down and makes a note.
He lifts another one.]
VALA
Respect.
HUTCHISON
(skeptically)
You look at this inkblot, and the first thing that pops into your
head is respect?
VALA
Yes, respect.
[Hutchison puts down the ink blot and folds his hands in front of him.]
HUTCHISON
Okay, Vala, this is called a projective test. It's designed to allow
me a little insight into your emotional state. I just want to get to
know you better, not pass judgment on you. I want to help, but to do
that, I'm going to need you to be completely honest and spontaneous
with your answers. Do you understand?
VALA
Of course! I'm sorry.
[She flashes a contrite smile, which he acknowledges.]
HUTCHISON
Oh.
[He lifts another ink blot.]
VALA
(promptly)
Kindness.
[Hutchison huffs in frustration and puts all the ink blots into his
briefcase. He takes a drink from his mug and glares at Vala, who gives
him a weak smile.]
EXT--VAGONBREI VILLAGE, NIGHT
INT--VAGONBREI ARCHIVES
[Daniel pours over papers at a table in the archive. Mitchell
approaches him.]
MITCHELL
Red team's wrapping it up. I figured we'd do the same.
DANIEL
(frustrated)
This can't be a dead end. There has to be something here.
[Daniel takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.]
MITCHELL
Take it up with Landry. You can come back tomorrow, knock yourself
out, strain your eyes all you want.
DANIEL
(sighing)
You're right. I could probably get a fresh start in the morning.
[He gathers his notes and follows Mitchell out.]
EXT--VAGONBREI VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Mitchell, Daniel following, meet the rest of the group outside.]
MITCHELL
All right, let's go home.
GRIMSBY
Hang on a minute. Where's Ackerman?
REIMER
Ackerman, come on! Bernie!
[Mitchell starts to search.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR
[Ackerman sits slumped in a chair, his arms crossed over his chest,
still holding his flashlight, apparently asleep.]
MITCHELL
Ackerman, let's go.
[Mitchell starts to leave, then notices Ackerman didn't react. He
returns and approaches Ackerman, tapping him on the far shoulder.]
MITCHELL
Yo, Ackerman! C'mon, wake up.
[Ackerman slides off the chair onto the floor, his body limp.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME BEDROOM
[Teal'c patrols outside as the rest of the group hovers over the
unconscious Ackerman, now lying in a small bed.]
MITCHELL
"He's asleep." What the hell kind of a diagnosis is that?
CARTER
Dr. Reimer says he won't know more until he's completed all the
bloodwork.
MITCHELL
There's got to be something more to it...like a coma.
REIMER
No, I'm afraid not. Coma patients don't respond to outside stimuli:
pain, sound, touch. Ackerman responds to all three. He even
flinches, reacts in his sleep state.
DANIEL
(concerned)
Why can't we wake him up?
REIMER
I don't know. I need to do more tests before I can say anything for
sure. And we have to contact Stargate Command and have them send out
the necessary equipment.
MITCHELL
I'm sorry, is that not something you'd be better off doing back at
the base?
REIMER
Ideally, yes. But, unfortunately, and just like Ackerman here, all
of our bloodwork shows an elevated white cell count and a marked
increase in seratonin levels. Whatever it is, we've all been
infected.
CARTER
You think this is the same thing that killed the villagers?
REIMER
Let's just say that, for the time being, I recommend we all try and
stay awake for as long as possible. If we fall asleep, we may never
wake up.
[SG-1 exchange worried looks.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Landry speaks to Mitchell via radio through the active wormhole.]
LANDRY
We're sending the medical supplies through now, Colonel.
MITCHELL
(over radio)
Roger that, sir.
LANDRY
Sure you don't want a little more help? I can send another team in
hazmat.
MITCHELL
(over radio)
Until we know what we're dealing with, sir, that would just be
risking more lives. We can handle it.
LANDRY
Understood.
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR
[Carter, Grimsby and Reimer sit around a table at their respective
laptops. Grimsby closes his eyes briefly. Teal'c who is pacing the
room, immediately notices and smacks him upside the head.]
GRIMSBY
(blinking)
I'm awake!
[Mitchell enters with a crate full of supplies. Carter and Teal'c
approach.]
MITCHELL
Compliments of Doctor Lam. We have...dextroampheta-something,
moto-whatchamacallit, uh, caffeine pills, and good old fashioned
coffee.
[Grimsby hurries over and grabs the caffeine pills, frantically taking
a large dosage of them.]
MITCHELL
Go easy there, Grimsby!
GRIMSBY
How long you been awake for?
MITCHELL
(yawning)
I dunno. What, twenty-four hours?
GRIMSBY
(irritated)
Yeah, talk to me when you get to forty.
[Grimsby walks away.]
CARTER
You've pulled all-nighters before, right?
MITCHELL
Yeah, loads of them.
CARTER
This feels worse, doesn't it?
MITCHELL
Yeah, I thought it was only me.
TEAL'C
I, too, am more fatigued than I would have expected.
CARTER
It has to be the infection. It doesn't just keep you from waking up,
it makes you want to sleep in the first place.
MITCHELL
Well, in that case...Teal'c?
[Mitchell hands Teal'c a dose of pills.]
TEAL'C
I prefer to rely on my tretonin.
[Mitchell hands the pills to Carter instead who takes them. Mitchell
also takes a dosage.]
MITCHELL
Cheers.
[Both dry swallow the pills. Mitchell takes Carter's seat at the table
across from Reimer.]
MITCHELL
Reimer. Whatcha got?
[Reimer blinks to alertness.]
REIMER
Since we started monitoring him, Ackerman has been in stage-four
level of what they call delta sleep or slow wave sleep.
CARTER
We also noted his brain is producing a surprising amount of
melatonin. It's a hormone synthesized from seratonin, a
sleep-inducing agent. That's what's keeping him asleep.
MITCHELL
So, all you've gotta do is figure out why his brain is producing
melatonin.
CARTER
We're working on it.
[Daniel enters, carrying a folio.]
MITCHELL
Jackson, what'd you find in the town records?
DANIEL
Uh, a handwritten entry from the village doctor in which he mentions
a sleeping sickness that affected the town. Now he doesn't go into
any great detail, but he does make mention of a possible source for
what was happening--Morgan Le Fay. See, it seems the, uh, villagers
believed she cursed them for revealing her whereabouts when King
Arthur and his knights came looking for her.
MITCHELL
So, did Arthur find her here?
DANIEL
Probably not. If the villagers believed she cursed them, then it's
more than likely she escaped. In any case, we have to go back to
that cave.
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Landry sits at his desk doing paperwork. Vala opens the door to the
office without knocking and pokes her head in, swaying the door back
and forth impatiently.]
VALA
General, just wondering if they've reached a decision on my mental
well-being yet.
LANDRY
Dr. Hutchison isn't finished with you yet. You're gonna meet with
him again later today.
[Vala steps inside and closes the door behind her. She approaches and
sits on the edge of Landry's desk.]
VALA
Ayi. If I may speak candidly, General. I have a feeling that Dr.
Hutchison is somewhat troubled. In fact, I think he may be suffering
from Klinefelter's Syndrome, but you didn't hear it from me.
LANDRY
The only thing Dr. Hutchison is suffering from is the headache you
gave him.
[Vala scoffs.]
LANDRY
I suggest you stop playing games and start taking this evaluation
very seriously.
VALA
I thought I was.
LANDRY
Let's call that delusional memory.
[Vala huffs in exasperation, slaps her knees and gets up, leaving the
room. Landry shakes his head and slowly exhales, raising his hand to a
stiff neck.]
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN, DAY
[Mitchell, Carter, and Teal'c enter the cave.]
MITCHELL
You know, it was Jackson's idea to come back here and check this
cave out again. I can't help noticing he's the only one who didn't
make the trip.
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson made it clear that his time would be better spent
continuing his research in the town records.
[Carter hands Mitchell a case.]
CARTER
Here. Dr. Reimer wanted us to take some soil samples.
MITCHELL
Why?
CARTER
Just in case this is where Ackerman picked up the infection.
[Carter pulls out a scanner from her vest and investigates the cavern.
Mitchell places the case on the ground and opens it. It contains a
large group of test tubes encased in foam.]
INT--SGC VIP ROOM
[Vala stands in front of a mirror, putting on perfume and brushing her
hair. There is a knock at the door.]
VALA
Hello.
[Woolsey opens the door.]
WOOLSEY
Hello. May I have a moment of your time?
VALA
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just on my way out. I've got a meeting.
WOOLSEY
With Dr. Hutchison, I know. That's why I'm here. I promise to be
quick.
[Vala turns around, intrigued. Woolsey enters and closes the door
behind him. She distractedly continues brushing her hair as she listens
to Woolsey.]
WOOLSEY
My name is Richard Woolsey. I work for the International Oversight
Advisory, a civilian-run organization made up of representatives
from the various nations involved in the Stargate program.
VALA
And what can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?
[Woolsey casually takes a seat at the small table and folds his hands.]
WOOLSEY
Why don't I tell you what we can do for you? We can see to it that
you pass your psychiatric evaluation with flying colors, effectively
putting any doubts Stargate Command may have about you to rest.
VALA
(suspiciously)
And what would you want in return?
WOOLSEY
Just a little...insight into the weekly goings on here at Stargate
Command. You see, despite the fact that all signatories to the Gate
Alliance Treaty are de facto partners in the Stargate program, my
employers are often left...out of the loop when it comes to the more
sensitive developments here on the base. We'd just like you to keep
us...updated, is all.
VALA
(sitting)
So, you want me...to be a spy.
WOOLSEY
(chuckling and standing)
I've read your file, Ms. Mal Doran. I don't think what we're asking
is that unusual, for someone with such a colorful history.
[Woolsey leaves, closing the door behind him. Vala looks pensive.]
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN
[Carter runs her scanner over a section of the wall. It beeps.]
CARTER
Cam? Teal'c? I think I found something!
[Teal'c and Mitchell approach.]
MITCHELL
Whatcha got?
CARTER
Well, it's a faint energy spike. I almost went past without noticing
it.
[Carter moves her hand along the wall near the readings. Suddenly, the
area she's touching depresses. Next to it a section of the wall, big
enough for a person to pass through, disappears in a flash of blue
light.]
MITCHELL
(in amazement)
Shazam.
[He moves to investigate. The opening leads to a long passageway.]
CARTER
I guess Daniel was right after all.
MITCHELL
Yes, he was. We should check this out.
TEAL'C
Would it not be prudent for one of us to return these samples to Dr.
Reimer as quickly as possible?
MITCHELL
No, he's right. We're on the clock, and we have no idea how deep
this hole is.
CARTER
All right. I'll go back. Stay in radio contact...at least as long as
you can.
[Carter heads back out of the cave as Teal'c and Mitchell begin to
explore the corridor.]
INT--SGC LAB
[A technician attaches leads to Vala for a polygraph machine. Hutchison
sits across the table from Vala, making notes on a paper.]
VALA
(disdainful)
Do you really think these will hold me?
HUTCHISON
Oh, those aren't restraints. We're hooking you up to a polygraph.
It's also known as a lie detector. It measures certain variables,
like blood pressure and heart rate, to determine whether you're
being truthful or not.
VALA
(with a wide false smile)
Oh, I see.
[The smile quickly disappears.]
HUTCHISON
Let's get started then, shall we?
[Hutchison nods to the technician and pulls out a group of papers.]
HUTCHISON
And, what's your name?
VALA
(hesitantly)
Vala Mal Doran.
[She watches the polygraph equipment out of the corner of her eye with
concern.]
HUTCHISON
Where did you spend the last week on Earth?
VALA
(biting her lip)
Here, at Stargate Command.
HUTCHISON
Have you ever stolen anything?
VALA
(with a convincing smile)
No.
[The needle of the polygraph scratches furiously, audible to everyone.]
VALA
That depends on how you define..."stolen".
HUTCHISON
These are control questions, designed to gauge your reaction by
eliciting both truthful and deceptive answers from you. You're doing
fine. Just, try and relax.
[Vala takes a deep breath. Hutchison glances at the technician, then
leans closer.]
HUTCHISON
You're looking very nice today.
[He indicates her hair.]
VALA
(giggling)
Oh, thank you. You're looking rather dashing yourself.
HUTCHISON
Oh, thanks.
[He starts to straighten his jacket, and notices the furious scratching
of the polygraph needle, indicating deception.]
VALA
(stammering)
I mean, nice...
[Hutchison shrugs, but notices the needle still scratches.]
VALA
I-I-I mean, not objectionable.
[Hutchison's face falls as the needle continues to scratch furiously.
Vala's mouth gapes open in shock and she makes furious faces at the
equipment.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR
[Carter takes some pills. Reimer is looking at his laptop at a
magnification display of a slide under the microscope attached to the
machine.]
REIMER
Colonel, come take a look at this.
[Carter approaches.]
REIMER
This was in that soil sample you brought back from the cave.
CARTER
(swallowing pills)
What is it?
REIMER
I believe it's a parasite.
[Carter looks closer.]
CARTER
Is it dead?
REIMER
No, it's dormant. Ackerman may have somehow awakened one?
CARTER
Well, how? It doesn't seem to react to movement.
REIMER
Excuse me. Let's see what happens when they come in contact with
live tissue.
[Reimer takes a needle and pricks his skin. He places the drop of blood
on the slide. Within moments, the parasite begins to move.]
CARTER
Whoa!
REIMER
I'll lay odds, that's your culprit right there.
CARTER
These people would have had no understanding of microbiology.
They-they probably came up with the story of Morgan's curse because
they couldn't comprehend what was happening to them.
[The door opens and Daniel staggers in, wearily carrying a pile of
books.]
CARTER
Hey.
(looks behind him)
Where's Grimsby?
DANIEL
(groggily)
He said he was on his way back. He isn't here?
[Carter shakes her head, looking worried.]
DANIEL
Oh no.
[Carter and Daniel leave to search. Reimer looks concerned.]
INT--CAVERN, VAGONBREI
[Mitchell and Teal'c continue down the cavern, each holding two lights.
Mitchell falls back, exhausted. He pauses and peels off his gloves.
Teal'c notices his condition.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps we should rest.
[Mitchell nods and begins to crouch and relax his muscles, but
immediately changes his mind.]
MITCHELL
No. That's a bad idea. And I am starting to regret staying up late
to watch Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo last night...Check that, I
regretted it almost immediately.
[Both hear a scuttling movement further down the cavern and tense,
alert.]
MITCHELL
Am I imagining things, or...
TEAL'C
I heard it as well.
[They shine their lights down the corridor, but see nothing. They move
cautiously forward.]
EXT--VAGONBREI VILLAGE AND FOREST, NIGHT
[Daniel walks through the forest, shining a flashlight.]
DANIEL
(calling)
Grimsby!
[He notices something and moves forward.]
DANIEL
(calling)
Sam?
[Carter runs over from another area. Daniel is standing over Grimsby,
who has fallen asleep in a haystack.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME, BEDROOM
[Reimer stands at the foot of Ackerman's bed, staring at his colleague.
Daniel and Carter are heard entering the other room.]
DANIEL
Well, we found Grimsby. He's asleep, and we can't wake him.
[Daniel and Carter enter the bedroom. They notice Reimer doesn't react
to them.]
CARTER
Dr. Reimer? What's wrong? Has his condition changed?
REIMER
(sadly)
You could say that. He's dead.
INT--VAGONBREI HOME BEDROOM
[The bedroom has been turned into a makeshift autopsy room with some
portable lights and basic medical equipment. Ackerman is laid out on a
long table. Reimer performs an autopsy with Carter assisting, both wear
surgical scrubs.]
REIMER
I see evidence of a ruptured aneurysm near the pineal gland.
CARTER
There's something else in here.
[Carter picks out something with forceps, and Reimer rinses it off. The
item looks to be a larger version of the parasite.]
REIMER
What the hell?
CARTER
Morphology is identical to the parasite we found in the soil sample.
REIMER
Only it's grown a thousand times bigger.
[Carter looks over, concerned, blinking to stay awake.]
INT--SGC VIP QUARTERS
[Vala storms into the room and throws herself face down on the bed,
looking angry. She is unaware that Woolsey is already waiting in the
room by the bookshelves, perusing a volume.]
WOOLSEY
(putting book back)
I'm assuming things didn't go well.
[Vala jumps up, startled. Before turning around to face him, she pauses
and processes his presence in her room. When she turns to face him, her
expression changes from shock to looking more vulnerable and hurt,
though she tries to maintain her composure.]
VALA
(voice breaking)
I fail to see the point of that ridiculous exercise, unless its
purpose was to thoroughly humiliate me. Those questions weren't
intended to shed light on my character, or delve deeply into my
subconscious. They were merely little reminders as to exactly
why...I don't belong here.
[Woolsey has been listening to her carefully. After she finishes, he
gives a calculating smile.]
WOOLSEY
Then I take it you've carefully considered our offer, and come to a
decision.
VALA
(solemnly)
I have.
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN
[Mitchell and Teal'c walk down a steep grade in the corridor. Along one
wall, Mitchell's flashlight picks out a four-legged reptilian creature
crawling on the wall before disappearing through a small hole.]
MITCHELL
Whoa!
[The two men move towards the hole. Mitchell drops to his knees to
rest, groaning in exhaustion. Teal'c bends over, also very fatigued.]
MITCHELL
Okay. Question. If what took out the village is what killed all the
wildlife around here, how come that little sucker's alive and
kickin'?
TEAL'C
It may possess a natural immunity to this mysterious affliction.
MITCHELL
Yeah, that's exactly my point, so all we've gotta do is catch Joe
Bob there, take him back up to Carter and Reemer--Reimer--whatever.
They reverse-engineer an antidote, and Bob's your uncle, we sleep
'til Tuesday.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
MITCHELL
(sighing)
Yeah.
(keys radio)
Carter, it's Mitchell.
[Only static can be heard through the radio.]
TEAL'C
We have progressed too far within the cave system.
MITCHELL
Yes, we have. All right, well...we'll nab Junior first, then we'll
call Carter when we get back up to the surface.
[Mitchell slowly stands and starts moving further into the cave.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR
[Reimer sits in front of his laptop, his eyes continually closing.
Carter sits next to him, also struggling to stay awake in front of her
computer. The door opens and Daniel enters. He staggers over to the
table and leans on a straight-backed chair.]
DANIEL
(wearily)
Progress?
CARTER
(hoarsely)
We've been, [cough] theorizing that when the parasite enters the
bloodstream, it triggers the body's immune response and the
production of seratonin, then it makes its way to the patient's
brain where it lodges and feeds.
[While she speaks, Reimer takes several pills and downs them with a
swig of water from a bottle.]
DANIEL
Feeds?
[He moves his chair next to Carter and collapses into it.]
DANIEL
On what?
REIMER
(tiredly)
Melatonin. Our analysis showed the parasite we removed from Ackerman
gorged itself on the stuff.
CARTER
It stimulates the production of melatonin which floods the body;
that's why the urge to sleep is so powerful. Once you give in, the
parasite just keeps on feeding until...
[Carter glances over to Daniel. Daniel is obviously trying to follow
the conversation with difficulty. He indicates she should continue.]
CARTER
The engorged parasite affects the surrounding cranial tissue,
eventually provoking a lethal aneurysm.
[Daniel slumps in his chair further. Carter clears her throat again.]
CARTER
(continuing)
But, we're thinking that it may be possible to starve out the
parasite. So, to that end, we have isolated a specimen that we
awakened from a dormant state.
[While Carter speaks, Reimer clutches his upper left arm. He cries out
in shock and pain.]
CARTER
Dr. Reimer?
[Reimer tries to stand, unable to talk. He collapses face first onto
the table, then his body slumps to floor, landing sprawled on his back.
Carter hurries over.]
CARTER
Dr. Reimer!
[Carter checks his vital signs.]
CARTER
(to Daniel)
It's his heart!
[Daniel races to the medical supplies, tossing items aside to reach the
portable defibrillator. He brings it over to Carter. Carter bares
Reimer's chest. While she charges the equipment, Daniel feels for a
pulse. Carter prepares the paddles and shocks Reimer. Nothing happens.
Daniel checks for a pulse. She resets the machine and does it again.
Daniel again checks for a pulse while she tries to build up another
charge.]
DANIEL
Sam...
[Carter shocks Reimer a third time.]
DANIEL
He's dead.
[Carter looks over at Daniel before they both look down, defeated, at
Reimer.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 25
[Several people are around the corridors. Vala bumps into one.]
VALA
Oh, I'm sorry.
[Hutchison comes out of a door, spotting Vala passing by.]
HUTCHISON
Ah, Vala.
VALA
Oh, not you again.
[She continues to walk, Hutchison trailing next to her.]
HUTCHISON
Ah, you know, you have another scheduled appointment.
VALA
What would be the point of that? You people have already made up
your minds about me.
HUTCHISON
Is that what you think?
VALA
Well, it's not like I haven't encountered this sort of thing before.
You know, I saw it every day in the eyes of the people who couldn't
separate me from the Goa'uld who enslaved them. So, you know,
instead of becoming a victim of their arrogance and stupidity, I
chose to take advantage of it. So, I lied, I cheated, and I stole.
I'm not going to apologize for it. And, to be perfectly honest with
you, I can't guarantee that I won't do it again, all right?
[Vala moves to the elevator and pushes the button.]
VALA
Of course, I have recently found myself risking my life for
something other than my own personal benefit. Maybe it's just a
phase--
[The elevator door opens. A technician steps out. An airman remains in
the car.]
VALA
(to airman in elevator)
Hold it, please.
(to Hutchison)
Or maybe, it's because, for the first time, I've actually met
someone who, in some small way, actually believes in me. But I'm
sure you're right, I'm sure it will pass.
[While Vala has been speaking she steps into the elevator and holds the
door open herself to continue her speech. When she is finished, she
allows the doors to close. Turning to the airman, she notes he's
overheard her tirade.]
VALA
What?
[Hutchison continues looking at the now closed elevator doors and
sighs.]
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR, NIGHT
[Daniel leans over a book, his elbow resting on the table, propping his
head in his hand. His eyes are closed. Carter steps by.]
CARTER
Daniel! You can't fall asleep. Do you hear me?
[Daniel, startled from dozing, blinks and sighs.]
DANIEL
(groaning)
Yeah.
[Daniel reaches for the pill bottle, but Carter stays his hand and puts
the pill bottle back.]
CARTER
Uh, we can't take any more of these either. With our seratonin and
melatonin levels spiking, it's too dangerous. We're going to have to
rely on each other, all right?
DANIEL
(with a tired sigh)
Okay.
[Carter squeezes his shoulder and sits back down by her laptop.]
INT--VAGONBREI CAVES
[The reptile jumps from rock to rock. It notices Mitchell approaching
and turns, curious.]
MITCHELL
Easy there...easy.
[Mitchell eases closer to the creature.]
MITCHELL
Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
[Mitchell suddenly pounces at the creature. He falls on his face in the
dirt, the reptile slipping through his grasp. It scurries away, right
into Teal'c's jacket, which he has laid there as a trap. Teal'c
immediately grabs the jacket and reptile and hugs it to his chest.]
TEAL'C
I've got it, Colonel Mitchell!
[Mitchell gives a thumbs up sign and groans, not moving more from his
position on the ground. Teal'c approaches. Mitchell makes a weak
attempt to rise, then collapses back into the dirt.]
TEAL'C
On your feet, Colonel Mitchell. There is much ground to cover if we
are to reach the surface.
MITCHELL
(face down in the dirt)
No, you-you go ahead without me. I'm just gonna-I'm just gonna stay
here. I'm cooked.
TEAL'C
(stubbornly)
Then I will carry you if I must.
[Teal'c reaches for Mitchell, but Mitchell weakly pushes his hand away,
rolling over onto his back.]
MITCHELL
(catching his breath)
Forget it. No! No, tretonin or not, it's going to catch up with you
at some point. The important thing for you to do is to take Curly
back to Carter and...whatshisname, and get them started on the cure.
TEAL'C
Indeed. I will return for you, Colonel Mitchell.
[Teal'c leaves, still cradling the reptile. Mitchell rolls back over
onto his stomach.]
MITCHELL
And I'll be...right here. Waiting on you.
INT--VAGONBREI HOME PARLOR
[Daniel takes notes at the table. Carter walks around it to the other
table, staggering. Behind Daniel she collapses to her knees.]
DANIEL
Sam! Sam...
[Daniel grabs her and helps her and props her to sit against the table,
crouching in front of her.]
CARTER
(weakly)
I can't do it anymore.
DANIEL
(sympathetically)
You have to. You gotta hang in there just a little while longer.
[Carter closes her eyes. Daniel can no longer hold himself up, and he
leans back, landing in a sitting position and leaning against the other
table. He closes his eyes.]
[The door opens and a medical technician in full hazmat gear enters.]
MED TECH
In here! Doctor Jackson, Colonel Carter, where's the rest of your
team?
DANIEL
(limply gesturing behind him)
Reimer and Ackerman are dead. Teal'c and Mitchell went to the caves.
MED TECH
What caves?
[Carter's head bobs loosely; she can't keep her eyes open. Daniel
collapses onto his side on the floor. More technicians enter.]
MED TECH
Get them in the isolation pods!
[Two technicians reach for Carter. Their handling of her causes Carter
to stir.]
CARTER
(weakly)
No. Wait. Wait!
[They lift her bodily and place in her in an isolation pod. Two more
technicians move Daniel into another pod.]
CARTER
No, wait. We can't go to sleep.
MED TECH
(soothing)
It's okay. We'll take care of you.
CARTER
No, you don't understand. The parasite. It feeds on...
[Carter continues to speak, but the cover is sealed on top of her,
blocking out the sound of her voice. Carter sees the technicians
through the glass window of the pod, but cannot hear what they are
saying. She blacks out.]
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN
[Teal'c stumbles through the cave, holding a flashlight and the
reptile.]
EXT--FOREST, VAGONBREI, PREDAWN
[A team in full medical hazmat gear carry two isolation pods through
the forest.]
INT--VAGONBREI CAVERN
[Teal'c makes his way out of the hidden passageway into the main
chamber. He collapses on the ground of the cavern, still clutching the
jacket. He turns and notices some daylight streaming in from the
entrance to the cave. Teal'c struggles to his feet and moves towards
the light.]
EXT--FOREST, VAGONBREI, DAWN
[Teal'c stumbles outside the cave. After taking several steps, he
collapses again, unable to go further. The hazmat team is nearby and
sees him, hurrying to his side.]
MED TECH
Take it easy, Teal'c. We've got you. Take it easy.
[Teal'c mumbles unintelligibly, appearing to call Mitchell's name. The
medical technician notices the reptile.]
MED TECH
(to team)
We've got some sort of animal here!
MED TECH TWO
We need to take it to the lab.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[SG-1 stand around a counter in Carter' s lab. Mitchell pours a cup of
coffee.]
MITCHELL
...Yeah, I was getting worked up, cussing at Teal'c, telling him to:
"Go on. Leave me." Must have been...twenty minutes before I realized
he had gone, and I was sitting there talking to myself.
[Teal'c smiles and nods.]
DANIEL
(to Carter)
What about you? Any hallucinations?
CARTER
Yeah, when they put me in the pod, I imagined I was being put in a
coffin. I thought I was being buried alive.
[Landry enters.]
LANDRY
Well, rise and shine. How are you feeling?
MITCHELL
Rested and ready to go, sir.
LANDRY
I assume Dr. Lam got you up to speed?
CARTER
Yes, sir. Between the sample they collected from Teal'c, and the
research Dr. Reimer and I conducted, they were able to produce a
serum that effectively isolated the parasite and starved it out.
MITCHELL
I just hate that that cave was a dead end. We went through all that
for nothing.
[Landry nods in sympathy.]
DANIEL
I wouldn't say that, exactly. I did find one reference in that
library that might prove to be useful--Atlantis.
CARTER
You think the location of Merlin's weapon is hidden in their
database?
DANIEL
I think it's worth checking out.
[The phone rings. Carter goes to answer it.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Carter...I see. We'll be right there.
[She hangs up the phone.]
CARTER
(to Landry)
There seems to be a problem in the Gate room, sir.
[Landry and SG-1 leave the office.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Vala stands on some cases at the bottom of the ramp. She is screaming
at technicians up in the control room. An SF keeps trying to pull her
down by her arm, but she absently twists her arm out of his grasp.]
VALA
I never liked you, and I know you can hear me! Dial the gate, now!
Dial the gate! Don't make me come in there!
(to the SF who keeps trying to pull her down)
You stop it!
[Vala shoves the SF in the chest. Landry and SG-1 enter the Gate room
and witness this.]
LANDRY
What's going on?
[Vala hops off the cases.]
VALA
(upset)
I'm leaving. I'm not staying somewhere where I'm not welcome, and
don't even think about making me stay against my will.
LANDRY
(innocently)
Wouldn't dream of it. But I figured you'd want to stay after going
through all the trouble of passing the psychiatric evaluation.
VALA
(puzzled)
I passed?
[SG-1 smiles on benignly.]
LANDRY
Dr. Hutchison seems to think that you have a lot of potential.
VALA
He does?
LANDRY
He feels you can make a significant contribution here at Stargate
Command. And I agree.
DANIEL
(pointedly)
Congratulations.
[Vala bites her lip, trying to maintain her composure. She drops the
shoulder bag she's been carrying.]
VALA
I-I'm a little...overwhelmed. Heh. But, as my first--official act,
I'd like to report a rather disagreeable little man.
[Woolsey enters the Gate room behind Vala.]
WOOLSEY
That would be me.
[Vala turns and glares at Woolsey. Woolsey responds with a confident
half-smile.]
LANDRY
Mr. Woolsey's offer was part of the test. We wanted to make sure we
could trust you.
[Vala turns back to Landry, straightening and crossing her arms over
the chest.]
VALA
I knew that. But were his sexual advances part of the test?
[Woolsey looks horrified. Landry looks from Vala to Woolsey sternly.
SG-1 exchange knowing looks.]
WOOLSEY
(stammering)
What!?! That's..ah...General, I-I can assure you...
VALA
Well, I would've even considered playing along, but some of his
requests were...well, a little...unusual, even for me.
[Vala smirks as Woolsey moves past her, approaching the General, who
turns on his heel and exits the Gate room. SG-1 poorly hides their
amusement.]
WOOLSEY
(following)
General, I would never...General.
[Vala steps closer to SG-1.]
VALA
So, when do I get one of these SG-1 badges?
MITCHELL
You don't. You're not a member of SG-1. You're a probationary member
of Stargate Command, who'll be subject to some very intensive
scrutiny for the next few months.
[While Mitchell speaks, he moves closer to Vala in a threatening
manner.]
VALA
(meekly)
Oh.
MITCHELL
Don't screw up.
[Vala shakes her head emphatically. Mitchell turns away. Daniel prompts
Mitchell with a pointed look and nod.]
MITCHELL
And welcome aboard.
[Vala grins and chuckles.]
VALA
See, I still think it's cause for celebration. So I say we go out,
have lunch, and I'll pay.
MITCHELL
Pay with what, exactly?
VALA
(matter-of-factly)
Well, Daniel will cover me until I get my share of the loot.
[Daniel sighs and drops his head to his chest.]
DANIEL
Loot?
[SG-1 and Vala walk out of the Gate room and down the corridor.]
VALA
Yeah, from all the treasures we're going to bring back from our
off-world travels. What, I have to wait until I'm off probation
before I start collecting?
FADE OUT
