TEASER
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Mitchell, in full dress uniform, is walking up the ramp to the
inactive Stargate.]
TECHNICIAN
Who's that?
HARRIMAN
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Harriman and another technician are standing and watching Mitchell
through the control room window.]
HARRIMAN
Two years ago. Dog fight over Antarctica. SG-1 found the Ancient
Outpost. Took out Anubis's fleet.
TECHNICIAN
(awed tone)
That's him?
HARRIMAN
That's him.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Mitchell is studying the Stargate with interest. He reaches down to
touch the ring.]
FLASHBACK
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
MITCHELL
Remember, no matter what, we're here to protect SG-1 at all costs.
[Squadron of F-302 fighters flying in Antarctica. Mitchell is piloting
the lead fighter and speaking through his comm to the other fighters.
His co-pilot, Banks, is seated behind him.]
MITCHELL
(on radio)
Target the Al'kesh first. Gliders second. Go low, boys and girls.
Prometheus has our backs.
[Battle scene of Earth and Goa'uld fighters from 7.21 "The Lost City".]
BANKS
Break left. Two gliders at our three o'clock.
[Mitchell veers away and two death gliders speed by. More scenes from
the aerial dogfight of Lost City, including SG-1 in their cargo ship.]
CARTER
(looking out window)
Prometheus.
HAMMOND
(over radio)
SG-1, this is Hammond, do you read?
CARTER
Yes sir, it's good to see you.
[Jack, Teal'c, Daniel, and Bra'tac are with Carter on the cargo ship.
More battle scenes from Lost City, showing Goa'uld and Earth ships in
aerial combat.]
BANKS
(looking at radar)
Contact. One bandit on the deck and inbound.
MITCHELL
Tally, one.
[Mitchell veers his fighter in an evasive maneuver and fires at the
Al'kesh.]
MITCHELL
Fox Two. Fox Two.
[Mitchell's weapons miss the Al'kesh.]
MITCHELL
So close.
[Explosion at the back of Mitchell's fighter. Mitchell looks around.]
BANKS
We've been hit. Left thruster is down.
(watching radar)
Contact. Two bandits on our six.
[Mitchell tries to maneuver his damaged ship to avoid the chasing
Goa'uld ships' weapons.]
REDMOND
(over comm to Mitchell)
Blue Leader, we've got your six.
[Another F-302 fires its weapons and destroys both Goa'uld death
gliders.]
MITCHELL
Nice shot, Red.
[An F-302 explodes from weapons' fire by another death glider.]
BANKS
He's been hit!
MITCHELL
Redmond!
BANKS
He's gone.
[Mitchell looks upset. His damaged craft flies over the snow, leaving a
trail of smoke and trailed by falling debris from destroyed ships.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Mitchell is crouched down, still studying the Stargate as the Gate
room door opens. He turns to see Harriman walk into the room.]
HARRIMAN
Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman.
[Mitchell gets up from his crouched position and walks down the ramp.]
HARRIMAN
The general's ready for you, Colonel.
[Mitchell passes Harriman and heads out the door.]
MITCHELL
(referring to the Stargate)
It's bigger than I thought it'd be.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
(calling after him)
Welcome to Stargate Command.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Harriman escorts Mitchell into Landry's office. Boxes are stacked on
the floor, and a basketball hoop with the air force insignia on the
backboard is already attached to the wall.]
HARRIMAN
Feel free to have a seat. General Landry will be with you shortly.
He's just finishing up a
briefing with SG-12.
MITCHELL
Thank you, Sergeant.
[Mitchell glances around the office, then looks through the star chart
etched window into the briefing room, where Landry is standing talking
to members of SG-12.]
FLASHBACK
INT--AIR FORCE HANGAR
[Mitchell and other air force personnel attired in flight suits are
converging near a F-302.]
MITCHELL
All right, boys and girls, listen up. We've got a change in plans.
New orders from General Hammond. We are no longer going after
Anubis's mother ship. SG-1 is on its way to Antarctica in a cargo
ship.
BANKS
SG-1?
MITCHELL
They think they may have found the Lost City of the Ancients.
REDMOND
(skeptical)
In Antarctica?
MITCHELL
It doesn't matter where they are or what it is they're doing. It's
SG-1 and we're going to cover their asses. ETA is nine minutes.
Expect the enemy to throw everything they have at us. All right,
saddle up, folks.
END FLASHBACK
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
LANDRY
(entering)
Cocky sons of bitches. Marines. Never liked them.
[Landry picks up Mitchell's service record off his desk and faces
Mitchell.]
LANDRY
You must be Colonel Mitchell.
[Mitchell moves from the window and faces Landry at the desk.]
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. It's good to be here, sir.
LANDRY
(flipping through papers in his hand)
Your service record's impeccable, Mitchell. What's wrong with ya?
MITCHELL
Sir?
LANDRY
Nobody's perfect. Everyone has some sort of character flaw. What's
yours?
MITCHELL
Sometimes, I can be impatient...sir.
LANDRY
(scoffs)
Well, all pilots have type-A personalities. I'm talking about your
kryptonite.
[Mitchell says nothing]
LANDRY
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.
(calling loudly)
Walter!
HARRIMAN
(over intercom)
The files on your desk are the personnel folders you're about to
request, sir.
LANDRY
(calling loudly)
About to request? Walter, I'd appreciate it if...
HARRIMAN
(over intercom)
You need to push the button to talk, sir.
[Mitchell tries to hide his amusement. Landry starts to say something,
then stops and sighs.]
LANDRY
(calling loudly.)
Thank you, Walter.
[Landry tosses Mitchell's service record on top of the pile and moves
around his desk to get some coffee at a table near the window.]
LANDRY
You know, the thing that's hardest to get used to around here is how
good everybody is at their job. Fact is, I like yelling at people.
Never get the damn chance.
MITCHELL
I'll try not to lower the average, sir.
LANDRY
Oh. Self-deprecating sense of humor. You think it'll make people
like you despite your outward perfection.
MITCHELL
(pausing for a moment)
No.
[Landry moves back to his desk and shoves a large pile of folders
towards Mitchell.]
LANDRY
Here you go, son. Get started.
MITCHELL
Sir?
[Landry picks up a framed certificate from the desk and moves to hang
it on the wall.]
LANDRY
You heard the disconnected voice of the little sergeant with psychic
powers. Those are personnel files. Start picking your team.
MITCHELL
General, I'm here to join SG-1.
LANDRY
Colonel, you're here to lead SG-1.
MITCHELL
(shocked and hesitant)
Uh, what about Lieutenant Colonel Carter?
LANDRY
She's taken command of Stargate's R & D out of Area 51.
MITCHELL
(upset)
Since when?
LANDRY
Last week.
MITCHELL
And Daniel Jackson?
LANDRY
Doctor Jackson put in for reassignment. Teal'c left the program over
a month ago. I'm surprised General O'Neill didn't tell you.
MITCHELL
(more upset)
No.
LANDRY
(chuckling while hanging another certificate)
Well, that's Jack for you. You know, I looked for the key to that
desk for a week before I finally got him to admit he never had one.
The man never opened a drawer the whole time he was here.
MITCHELL
(still in shock)
I'm sorry, sir. The reason that I requested this post...Why...Why I
worked so hard...
[Landry picks up Mitchell's file and puts it on his desk. He moves
around the desk towards Mitchell, picking up the basket full of folders
as he speaks.]
LANDRY
(sarcastically)
Expresses himself poorly when faced with unexpected challenge? Your
sheet says that you have "outstanding" leadership skills. Take the
files, Colonel. Choose your team before I start to question the
accuracy of that claim.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[The office is in disorder. Boxes, papers, and packaging are scattered
all over. Several items are off the shelves and books are piled
together. Daniel is moving two storage boxes to an empty chair when
Mitchell knocks at the open doorway.]
MITCHELL
Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
(surprised)
Colonel.
[They approach each other and shake hands.]
MITCHELL
My friends call me Cameron.
DANIEL
Daniel. Uh, how are you?
MITCHELL
I'm good, thanks.
[Daniel returns to packing, slightly puzzled by Mitchell's appearance.]
DANIEL
Uh, yeah. I heard you were coming.
MITCHELL
Yeah, they told me you were leaving.
DANIEL
(smiling)
Yes. Finally. You don't, uh...
(gestures at the packing)
...you don't want to help?
MITCHELL
No, actually, I came to see if I could talk you into staying.
DANIEL
You're kidding.
MITCHELL
I've been given command of SG-1.
DANIEL
Wow. Well. Well, good for you. You...uh...you deserve it.
MITCHELL
I think the SGC still needs you.
DANIEL
Whoa. There's lots of other guys.
MITCHELL
You're the world's foremost expert on the Ancients.
DANIEL
(smiling)
Yes. And that's why I'm going to Atlantis: "City of the Ancients."
MITCHELL
Listen. General O'Neill gave me the choice of any posting I wanted.
I chose SG-1. That meant Colonel Carter, Teal'c, and yourself. Not
two letters, a dash, and a number.
DANIEL
(still packing)
Uhh, that's nice...
MITCHELL
I wanted to be on the front line, working with the best. I wanted to
learn from you.
DANIEL
Look, this is all very flattering, but uh...
MITCHELL
That's not the point.
DANIEL
(stops packing and looks serious)
I'm sorry. I mean I know I owe you one; we all do.
FLASHBACK
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
[Mitchell's damaged F-302 flies evasively, avoiding fire from a
pursuing death glider.]
BANKS
We've lost a turbine.
CARTER
(over comm)
Head's up, Blue Leader. This is Carter. We have another bandit,
incoming.
MITCHELL
I see it, Major.
[Mitchell plots a firing solution on an Al'kesh and fires his weapons.]
MITCHELL
Fox Two.
[The Goa'uld Al'kesh explodes.]
MITCHELL
Splash, one Al'kesh.
CARTER
(looking through cargo ship window)
That was close.
END FLASHBACK
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
MITCHELL
Listen, Jackson...I don't want you to stay because you think you owe
me one. Unless, of course, you're considering it.
DANIEL
Oh, no no.
(reaches into pocket)
I was just going to offer you my apartment.
[Daniel holds out his key to Mitchell. When Mitchell doesn't
immediately take it, Daniel shrugs and drops the key on the table as he
exits his office.]
MITCHELL
(defeated)
Right.
EXT--DARKARA, DAY
[The Stargate is visible outside the temple. Al'kesh and death gliders
are flying nearby.]
INT--THE TEMPLE AT DAKARA
[Mitchell in green SGC uniform and Teal'c in dress Jaffa robes are
walking through the vast temple. Ornate columns and torches decorate
the corridor.]
MITCHELL
Brother, I love what you've done with the place.
TEAL'C
These columns were salvaged and restored from the original Ancient
monument.
MITCHELL
Well, it's got a real high council feel to it. Hope you're taking
lots of before and after pictures.
TEAL'C
Where is the rest of your team, Colonel Mitchell?
MITCHELL
Actually, it's still kind of "SG-Me." That's one of the reasons I'm
here. I was hoping...maybe you could help me.
TEAL'C
(considering)
I can offer some names of those I consider to be honorable warriors.
MITCHELL
I appreciate that. I know you're busy.
TEAL'C
We are attempting to build a whole new system of government that
will span Jaffa worlds throughout the galaxy.
MITCHELL
Yeah, how's that going?
TEAL'C
Not well.
MITCHELL
Well, your people did just renounce their gods. I guess we've got to
cut them a bit of a break.
TEAL'C
Too many are still steeped in an old culture full of antiquated
rituals and are slow to accept
change.
MITCHELL
I understand Major Davis and SG-7 are trying to help out.
TEAL'C
That has caused problems as well. Many view the Tau'ri with the same
level of mistrust as a would-be enemy. They see the proposed system
of government as a means to control and subvert their newly acquired
freedom. My allegiance to the Tau'ri is not serving me as well as
you might think at winning votes from the most traditional of the
Jaffa electorate.
MITCHELL
Wow. Politics really does suck everywhere you go.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[In the distance, Rak'nor approaches the pair.]
MITCHELL
Listen, maybe it's a good thing I came by. If this...doesn't work
out...before all the space on my team fills--
RAK'NOR
(interrupting)
Teal'c, the council's returning from recess.
TEAL'C
I must go.
MITCHELL
(frustrated)
Sure.
[Teal'c and Rak'nor head down another hallway. Teal'c calls back to
Mitchell.]
TEAL'C
It has been good to see you, Colonel Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Yup.
TEAL'C
I will forward a list of names as soon as I am able.
MITCHELL
(calling back to him)
Have fun.
[Mitchell is alone in the corridor, moving around in a bit of a circle
and muttering to himself as Jaffa pass by in various directions.]
MITCHELL
Did I mention I'm on a mission from God? Okay. Never mind.
(spots a passing male Jaffa)
Yo, you want to join SG-1?
[As the male Jaffa continues past, Mitchell spots an attractive female
Jaffa walking past.]
MITCHELL
(sultry voice)
Hi. Cameron Mitchell, Colonel.
[He continues trying to talk to various passing Jaffa, who ignore him.]
MITCHELL
Excuse me, can you tell me which way to the Stargate? Stargate?
Chappa'ai? Chap...Just point a finger.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Mitchell is sitting in front of a monitor, buttoning his shirt. Carter
comes on the monitor screen via a video conference feed from the
Prometheus.]
CARTER
Hi, Cameron.
MITCHELL
Hey, Sam. It's good to see you.
CARTER
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. We have been up to our
ears double-checking the new hyperdrive. And then the uplink was
jammed with the long-range plotting program being transmitted by the
Asgard...No need to bore you. How you been? You look good.
MITCHELL
Thanks. Listen, Sam...come back and rejoin SG-1.
CARTER
(laughing)
I heard you'd been given command. Congratulations.
MITCHELL
I'm not kidding. You can keep an eye on R & D in your spare time,
just like you always have. Besides, Dr. Lee is pouting because you
got the post over him.
CARTER
(irked)
Really?
MITCHELL
No, I made that up.
CARTER
(half-smiles)
I have my reasons for wanting this job.
MITCHELL
I had my reasons for wanting THIS job. One of them was working with
you. And please, do not say, "that's nice."
CARTER
We'll still work together.
MITCHELL
It won't be the same. What if the world needs saving?
CARTER
Well, if the world needs saving, I will be there to do what I can.
MITCHELL
(fiercely)
What if the world needs saving because I screwed up 'cause you
weren't here in the first place?
[Carter looks puzzled at Mitchell's comment. Mitchell sighs and looks
around to see if anyone else overheard.]
MITCHELL
How about we pretend I didn't say that?
CARTER
Done.
VOICE OVER PROMETHEUS LOUDSPEAKER
(heard through video link)
Lieutenant Colonel Carter to the bridge. Lieutenant Colonel Carter,
please report immediately to the bridge.
CARTER
Sorry, I gotta go.
MITCHELL
Yeah. I'll buy you breakfast when you get back on solid ground.
CARTER
(smiling)
You're on. Talk to you soon.
[Video link shuts off as Mitchell waves. Mitchell leans back and rubs
his hand across his face, groaning loudly. He looks across the control
room to where Harriman is sitting.]
MITCHELL
Well, Walter. It doesn't look like we're getting the band back
together.
FLASHBACK
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
MITCHELL
I can't shake him. Reroute power to the...
[Flash of light as the rear of Mitchell's F-302 is struck by weapon's
fire and a shower of sparks fills the cockpit. Banks is thrown forward
at the impact and collapses, still strapped to his copilot chair, blood
dripping from his forehead.]
MITCHELL
Banks, you okay? Banks!
(Mitchell struggles with the controls.)
Aww, I'm losing it. Hang on back there.
(He reaches back to pull their ejection levers.)
Eject! Eject!
(Nothing happens)
Dammit, ejection failed. Mayday! Mayday! We are going in. Repeat. We
are going in.
[Mitchell's F-302 crashes into the Antarctic snow, breaking the glass
in the windshield. The ship skids across the ground quite a distance,
creating plumes of snow in its wake.]
EXT--PATIO OF LANDRY'S HOUSE, DAY
[O'Neill and Landry are sitting at a patio table, drinking beer and
playing chess. A large black dog is lying at Landry's feet.]
O'NEILL
So, did you decide to go with the desk at an angle, or flush with
the door?
LANDRY
Is that what this is about? You come all the way to Colorado Springs
to check up on me?
O'NEILL
No. I had to sign the papers to my house, and my car...motorcycle...
LANDRY
You know, I'll never forget that day, on the front porch of my
house, you standing there saying you wanted to tell me something
about the Stargate Program. Heh heh. I thought one of us had surely
lost his mind.
O'NEILL
That may actually be true. How are things working out for Mitchell?
LANDRY
Well, you could've told him that SG-1 had been reassigned. You
should have seen his face.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Yeah. I suppose, huh?
LANDRY
Yeah. He'll uh...he'll get his feet.
[He makes a chess move.]
LANDRY
Man's a survivor.
[O'Neill makes a chess move.]
O'NEILL
He's also got the best of the best looking out for him.
LANDRY
A general's only as good as the people he commands.
O'NEILL
Who said that?
LANDRY
(smirking)
I just did.
[Landry moves a rook in a decisive gesture. O'Neill looks slightly
bemused by either the move or Landry's statement.]
LANDRY
I mean, Douglas MacArthur may have said something similar.
O'NEILL
Didn't he also say, "there is no substitute for winning"?
[O'Neill moves his bishop to fortify his attack on Landry's king and
queen.]
LANDRY
(sighing)
Actually, it was: "In war, there is no substitute for victory."
[Landry knocks his king over with his beer bottle, conceding the chess
match.]
LANDRY
(chuckling)
You seem to have a knack for it.
[Landry and O'Neill toast with their beer bottles.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Mitchell is sitting at the briefing table studying a file; a large
stack of other file folders is on the table to his left, a small stack
of two folders is to his right. A female Air Force officer sits across
from him, Dr. Lindsay.]
LINDSAY
I'm fluent in Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, three dialects of Goa'uld,
Teneeze, Golap, and the yet unnamed language of the cave people of
P3K-447. And of course Ancient, spoken as well as written. Go ahead,
say anything.
MITCHELL
Nah, that's okay. I believe you.
LINDSAY
Tua puta ego. Which is actually just, "I believe you." "That's okay"
is a modern vernacular that can't be directly translated into
Ancient. However...
MITCHELL
(motioning for her to stop)
This is really unnecessary.
LINDSAY
On na matta netario.
MITCHELL
(rests his head in his hand)
Thank you.
[A military man of unknown rank now sits across from Mitchell. Mitchell
is studying another file.]
DAVE
(in clipped tone)
87 mission hours to 32 alien planets. Front-line ground combat on
four different occasions.
MITCHELL
I was hoping you could tell me something about yourself.
(closes file and pats it.)
Something personal.
DAVE
(taken aback)
People call me Dave.
MITCHELL
(double checks file)
It says here that's your name.
DAVE
(nods briefly)
Yes.
[More time has passed. Mitchell places a piece of chewing gum in his
mouth. A closed file folder is in front of him. The piles of file
folders on either side of him are now about equal in height.]
SCIENCE CANDIDATE
The magnetic properties of the planet make it an excellent choice
for the long-term study of
positively charged ions on the neurons of the brain.
[More time has passed. Mitchell peers from behind a folder. There's an
empty chair. A disembodied voice is heard.]
MILITARY CANDIDATE
25...26...27...28.
[Mitchell stands up and leans over the briefing table.]
MILITARY CANDIDATE
...29...30...
[The military candidate is doing push ups on the briefing room floor.]
MILITARY CANDIDATE
...31...32...
[More time has passed. Mitchell is sitting back turned to the table,
slowly spinning in his chair. A folder is centered on the table in
front of him. The pile of folders on his left are now a mere handful
and the pile on his right sits higher than his shoulder.]
SCIENTIST
We have modified the android body recovered from PX3-989, and are
currently incorporating the experiences of every SG team member
since the inception of the program into a viable artificial
intelligence.
[Mitchell spins to look at two scientists. They stand, complete with
lab coats, in front of a white board that has a chart showing various
annotated pictures of the head and full body of a humanoid form.]
MITCHELL
(becoming alert)
Wait a minute. Are you guys saying that this thing actually exists?
SCIENTIST
We haven't received our funding yet. But we were hoping that with
your support, perhaps the funding body would look more favorably on
our proposal. Don't make a decision yet. We do have a concise, but
thorough, 380 page report for you to peruse...
[While the scientist is speaking, Mitchell turns away and gets up from
his chair. He walks to the briefing room window and looks down at the
Stargate.]
FLASHBACK
EXT--MITCHELL'S DOWNED F-302, ANTARCTICA, DUSK
[Mitchell is barely conscious inside his cockpit. The Antarctic wind is
blowing into the craft through the shattered windshield. Voices are
coming over the communication link.]
KIRKLAND
(over comm)
Thousands of bright yellow--I don't know. They're coming from the
surface. I don't know what they are. They're cutting the enemy fleet
to shreds! My God! It's beautiful!
MAN
(over comm)
They're Ancient weapons. It's SG-1. They found what they were
looking for!
MAN 2
(over comm)
The enemy ships are being destroyed! They're just exploding
everywhere we look!
[Mitchell succumbs to unconsciousness.]
FLASHBACK
INT--PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM
[The following are a montage of flashbacks, all taking place in the
same setting and viewed through Mitchell's eyes. He drifts in and out
of consciousness, and every time he reopens his eyes, there is a new
memory. These changes will be signified by a BLINK.]
[Nurse adjust i.v. and smiles at him.]
NURSE
Don't worry. You're going to be okay...
BLINK
[Doctor and Nurse are standing directly over Mitchell working on his
chest.]
NURSE
Respiration is weak.
DOCTOR
He's bleeding internally. I need an ultrasound...
BLINK
AIR FORCE OFFICER
First Lieutenant Adam Banks's body was recovered at 0843 this
morning.
BLINK
[The hospital room is decorated for Christmas. A teary-eyed older woman
approaches.]
MITCHELL'S MOTHER
Oh my. Cameron?
BLINK
DOCTOR
...make the chance of you walking quite slim. But with
physiotherapy, hopefully...
BLINK
[Daniel, wearing civilian clothes, sits at Mitchell's bedside.]
DANIEL
None of us would be here today if it wasn't for what you did.
BLINK
[Carter and two other air force personnel, all in full dress uniform
are standing in Mitchell's room, which is no longer decorated for a
holiday.]
CARTER
The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in
action against an enemy force that can be bestowed upon an
individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States of
America. On behalf of the President...
BLINK
[O'Neill is leaning against the window by the foot of Mitchell's bed.
He is in his full dress uniform.]
O'NEILL
Get well soon. And when you do, you can do anything you want, and I
mean...professionally...anything you want. Well not...anything.
END FLASHBACKS
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Mitchell jogs through the door into the Gate room, where Landry is
already waiting. Klaxons are blaring, and a full contingent of security
is already standing by.]
MITCHELL
What's up, sir?
LANDRY
I wanted you here for this. SG-12 sent word five minutes ago. They
should be arriving momentarily.
HARRIMAN
(over intercom from SGC control room)
Receiving IDC. Opening the iris.
[There is the sound of the iris opening. Vala, dressed in a
form-fitting black leather outfit and carrying a leather jacket over
her shoulder, backs through the active wormhole followed by two members
of SG-12, one of whom is carrying a silver case. Vala spins to take in
the Gate room and all the security.]
VALA
Well. Don't you all have me surrounded.
LANDRY
Welcome to the SGC. I'm General Landry.
VALA
Vala. Vala Mal Doran.
(she strides down the ramp)
Thank you so much for the lovely greeting party. We all had a
wonderful time searching each other, didn't we, boys.
(she pauses and looks at Mitchell)
I know we haven't met. That I'm sure I would remember.
[Vala turns to Landry for an introduction.]
LANDRY
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
MITCHELL
(cocking his head)
Nice outfit.
VALA
Thanks! While I would normally be thrilled to have so much
testosterone at my disposal...Where's my Daniel?
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Mitchell and Landry are seated at the briefing table. The silver case
sets in front of Mitchell. Vala is standing on the gate room side of
the table. SFs are scattered throughout the room. Daniel enters,
walking quickly. Vala smiles demurely at him and takes a few steps
forward.]
DANIEL
(impatient)
Okay. Where is it?
VALA
(taken aback)
Nice to see you too? How have you been?
DANIEL
The tablet! The one that leads to the "incredible Ancient buried
treasure."
VALA
There is no tablet.
[Mitchell turns and looks at Vala in surprise, his hand resting on the
case.]
DANIEL
What?
VALA
I lied. I had to tell you in...person. I'm pregnant.
[Daniel stands still, fuming. Landry scoffs.]
VALA
Pretty sure it's yours, anyway. There's at least a one in...
(scrunches face)
...hmm...ten chance?
[Vala winks at Mitchell, who does a double take. Daniel spins around to
exit. He makes it to the doorway before Landry's voice stops him.]
LANDRY
Dr. Jackson! You're the reason we let her through the gate.
DANIEL
I'm sorry, sir. I really have to finish packing...
LANDRY
(standing and leaving the room himself)
The Daedalus doesn't leave for another 12 hours. At least have a
look.
[Mitchell opens the case and moves a piece of parchment to one side so
Vala can lift the tablet out of the case. Daniel sullenly moves back to
the table and stands next to where Mitchell is sitting.]
VALA
(to Mitchell)
Thank you.
[Vala offers the tablet to Daniel, who snatches it from her hand. He
studies it for a moment and sighs.]
DANIEL
Yep, I don't know where you got this, but uh, you got ripped off.
It's complete gibberish.
[Daniel hands the tablet back to Vala, who doesn't take it back.]
VALA
It's written in code.
[Daniel studies the tablet again. Mitchell stands next to Daniel to
look as well.]
DANIEL
Well, I can't crack this in a few hours.
VALA
I know the cipher.
DANIEL
(biting his words out)
Then why do you need me?
VALA
Well, reading it is one thing, understanding it is another. The
individual I got this from assured me that the treasure it describes
is here on Earth. Now, I could have come by ship and looked for it
myself, but I know nothing about your fair planet...other than it
seems to have a rather interesting, if somewhat limited, gene pool.
[Vala looks pointedly at Daniel and Mitchell, who look at her, turn to
each other and blink, then turn back to her. Vala smiles.]
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel's office is full of even more boxes. The bookshelves are almost
bare. Daniel is hunched over his center worktable, studying the tablet.
The silver case with its other contents are also on the table. Vala is
browsing through various tagged items still not packed that are sitting
on the counters and shelves.]
DANIEL
So, where'd you get this?
VALA
The Jaffa may have won their freedom, but there's still more than a
few Goa'uld out there. Most of them have lost their dynasties,
though, and they're either on the run or in hiding.
DANIEL
Yeah, no doubt plotting some means of regaining their power.
VALA
Yes, and in the meantime, they are having a lot of trouble
maintaining the lifestyle to which they've grown so accustomed over
the last 5,000 years or so. As such, there are a number of rather
interesting artifacts currently on the market.
[Vala has now circled the room and is standing very close to Daniel. He
glances up at her before returning his attention to the tablet.]
VALA
Anyway, that isn't the issue. The question is, what's it worth?
DANIEL
Well, the Ancients aren't exactly known for secret stashes of gold.
(he looks into her silver case)
Like these, for example.
[Vala looks vaguely worried at this response. Daniel reaches into the
case for one of the other items Vala also brought. It's a small gold
rectangular item with ornate decoration. Vala picks up the mate to the
item Daniel's holding, which he's now studying with a confused
expression.]
DANIEL
Wait a minute. These markings are Goa'uld. The treasure's supposed
to be Ancient. What do they have to do with this?
VALA
These are actually only loosely related to the tablet.
DANIEL
Yeah? How?
VALA
Have you ever heard of the Goa'uld Nut?
DANIEL
As in cashew? Pea? Oh, you mean the Egyptian sky goddess?
VALA
(excited)
Yes.
DANIEL
(bored)
No. Never heard of her.
VALA
Well, these were her ceremonial marriage bracelets. She wore one and
her husband of the moment wore one.
DANIEL
(still skeptical and studying the bracelet)
"Of the moment."
VALA
Yes, she had many. It's one of the few admirable things about her.
[In a split second, Vala reaches over and slaps the bracelet she is
holding onto Daniel's right wrist, where it wraps around and snaps
shut. At the same time, she snatches the one he is holding out of his
hand.]
DANIEL
Ow. What are you doing?
[Daniel struggles to pull the bracelet off his wrist to no avail. Vala
looks triumphant.]
DANIEL
(grunting in frustration, calling toward the door)
Security.
[He moves behind the two SFs who enter and are now pointing handguns at
Vala. After another futile attempt to pull the bracelet off, Daniel
holds his wrist out towards her, still staying behind the armed
security forces.]
DANIEL
Okay. That was fun. Now take it off.
VALA
Not until we find the treasure.
DANIEL
What!?!
VALA
These bracelets...
[Vala slaps the matching bracelet over her own left wrist. She bends
her arm at the elbow to display her new jewelry.]
VALA
...link us together. The tablet is mine, and I want my fair share of
what it leads to.
[Daniel looks upset.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC LAB
[Daniel is leaning over a worktable with goggles on, sighing heavily
and looking bored and resigned. Across from him, Lee has a full welding
mask over his face and is using an electrical saw to try and cut the
bracelet. The whirring noise of the blade abruptly stops. Lee looks at
the saw, then sets it on the table.]
LEE
That's the third blade I've gone through. I'm not going to be able
to cut it off...
(suddenly inspired)
...the hand. If we remove the hand from... No, I know that on first
blush that doesn't sound like a viable option,
[Daniel rolls his eyes.]
LEE
(continuing)
but I understand that Dr. Bennet is becoming quite proficient adept
at reattaching--
DANIEL
(interrupting)
I thought SG-12 checked everything she had on her.
LEE
(sighing loudly)
They did. And in their defense, at that time, the bracelet wasn't
giving off any kind of energy signature.
(pointing to monitoring screen)
I mean, even now, it's barely measurable.
DANIEL
So, what's it doing? I mean, how does it work?
LEE
(equivocating and looking at the monitor)
Well, I don't know.
[Daniel sighs and pulls off the monitoring leads from the bracelet.]
LEE
No. No. I just need a little more time.
[Daniel takes his goggles off and sets them on the table.]
DANIEL
(barely holding his temper)
I'll find out.
[Daniel, annoyed, exits the room, putting on his glasses as he walks.
When he gets to the doorway, his eyes roll back and he collapses,
unconscious. Lee witnesses the collapse and quickly approaches him.]
LEE
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?
INT--SGC HOLDING ROOM
[Landry enters the holding room with an SF. There is a bunk in the
corner. In the opposite corner, Vala is leaning against a desk, playing
with the desk lamp as if to create an interrogation spotlight on
Landry.]
VALA
Come to torture me?
LANDRY
How old are you?
VALA
Hmm. Mental abuse won't work either.
[Vala puts down the lamp and approaches Landry, circling around him as
he speaks.]
LANDRY
I have a daughter about your age. Hasn't listened to me since she
was twelve. Doesn't matter what I say or do.
[Vala stops circling to stand in front of Landry.]
VALA
You're not going to bore me with your personal life, are you? I have
to admit, an hour or two of that might break me.
LANDRY
(leaning forward angrily)
I don't like being deceived.
VALA
I'm not here to hurt anyone, and I really do hope this leads to
something fabulous for all of us, but it's not easy out there. And
I'm sure you can appreciate that a girl has to do what a girl has to
do to get by--
LANDRY
I am about as interested in your sob story as you are in mine. I
just want you to know that Dr. Jackson is the one who recommended I
let you through the gate. He thought there was a chance that what
you had to offer might be legitimate. And, he's the one with an
alien device now stuck on his wrist. Now how this plays out, and
what you get out of it in the end, I'm going to leave entirely up to
him. So, if I were you, I--
[Vala puts her hands on Landry's shoulders then collapses onto the
floor. Landry stands in shock as the guards rush to check on her.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is waking up in an infirmary bed, wearing blue scrubs and
hooked up to monitors. Teal'c, in his Jaffa robes, is sitting in a
chair by his side, not noticing he's awake.]
DANIEL
Teal'c?
[Surprised, Teal'c stands and moves closer to Daniel.]
TEAL'C
(relieved and surprised)
Daniel Jackson.
[Mitchell suddenly appears next to Teal'c. He's been sitting in a chair
nearby.]
MITCHELL
How you doin'?
DANIEL
Uh, fine...I think. I don't know what happened. I was--
MITCHELL
It's the bracelet.
[Daniel lifts his wrist to look at the bracelet.]
TEAL'C
They are called kor mak.
MITCHELL
(indicating Teal'c with a nod)
Figured he might know.
[Mitchell moves to the end of the bed.]
DANIEL
Yeah, she said they were some sort of weird Goa'uld Nut marriage
thing.
TEAL'C
(cautiously)
I do not believe that to be the case.
DANIEL
No?
TEAL'C
(regretfully)
No.
DANIEL
Should've known.
TEAL'C
I have only heard of them in passing a very long time ago. But I
believe it was Cronus who used this technology when a prisoner of
value needed to be transported by one of his Jaffa. He would affix a
bracelet such as this to both the prisoner and the Jaffa responsible
for him. If they became separated for more than a short period of
time, they would both become ill and die.
DANIEL
Both?
VALA
(offscreen)
That's just about the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[Teal'c turns and steps aside, and Daniel sees Vala lying in another
infirmary bed across the room and at a ninety degree angle to his. Like
him, she is dressed in infirmary scrubs and hooked up to monitors. Her
hands are tied with padded leather restraints to the sides of the bed.
Daniel raises himself to lean on his elbow.]
DANIEL
You didn't know?
VALA
Well, I knew it would make you sick. I didn't know it would have the
same effect on me too.
[Daniel pounds the mattress with his fist.]
DANIEL
(yelling through his clenched teeth)
How could you not KNOW?
VALA
Because the person that I stole it from didn't tell me that part!
[Daniel grunts in rage and throws one of his pillows at Vala, and she
deflects it by raising her knees as she lets out a cry of frustration
herself. Daniel flops back onto his mattress. Vala sighs and flops back
onto her own pillow. Teal'c looks at Daniel with an amazed and
questioning expression.]
MITCHELL
Question. Why would the Goa'uld design these things that way?
TEAL'C
To punish the Jaffa for his incompetence.
MITCHELL
Right, of course.
DANIEL
(to Teal'c)
Can you take it off?
TEAL'C
I am sorry, Daniel Jackson. As I have said, I have only heard of
this technology in passing.
[Daniel rises from his prone position to lean on his elbow again.]
DANIEL
(furious, to Vala)
Please tell me you know how to take this off!
VALA
(pauses for a moment, enjoying Daniel's torment)
Yes, of course I do.
(pauses more and grins)
I mean...that's assuming that the person I stole them from was
honest about that part.
DANIEL
(drops his head in a defeated expression and hisses)
Just...do it.
VALA
(annoyed, then cheerily)
All right! As soon as we find the treasure, and I get my fair share.
[Daniel motions for Teal'c to come closer.]
DANIEL
(quietly)
Okay. Just to clarify. When I kill her, I die?
TEAL'C
(nodding)
Just as if you left her proximity.
[Daniel pinches the bridge of his nose.]
MITCHELL
Or we could just find the treasure.
[Daniel looks up at Mitchell in surprise and question.]
MITCHELL
The Daedalus left two hours ago. Sorry.
[Daniel collapses flat onto his bed, deflated. Teal'c looks on in
sympathy.]
MITCHELL
Look, the tablet is written in Ancient code, right? I know it's not
the lost city of Atlantis we're looking for here, but whatever it is
could be worth finding. Or you're just going to have to marry that
chick.
VALA
(grinning from ear to ear)
Yeah! Let's make babies!
[Daniel sighs heavily.]
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel, Teal'c, Vala and Mitchell are all in Daniel's office. The
three men are dressed in SGC uniforms. Vala is wearing her leather
outfit. Daniel studies the tablet. Vala is once again browsing though
Daniel's artifacts. The boxes are gone, some items are hanging on the
walls, and a few books are on the shelves.]
DANIEL
Are you sure you have this cipher right?
VALA
Yes, why?
DANIEL
(muttering to Teal'c as he moves to his computer)
I can't believe I missed the Daedalus for this.
VALA
(overhearing)
Get over it.
MITCHELL
(to Teal'c)
You don't have to get back to Dakara?
TEAL'C
The council is in recess until tomorrow.
MITCHELL
Curious?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
MITCHELL
(excited)
See, this is good, isn't it? Being part of a team again. Working
together to unravel some cool ancient mystery? All right, so we're
not...working together. But any minute now, I bet Dr. Jackson
discovers some key piece of information that sets us off on a great
adventure.
DANIEL
(to himself, looking at his computer screen)
This can't be right.
[The other three turn to look at Daniel. Vala looks excited and moves
behind him. Mitchell gives a "see" look to Teal'c as they both approach
the computer desk.]
VALA
What is it?
DANIEL
Uh, well, this is a portion of the database the Atlantis expedition
brought back with them a few weeks ago. Specifically, it's a log of
the names of the Ancients who left the planet when it was under
siege from the Wraith and returned to Earth.
TEAL'C
Thousands of years ago.
DANIEL
Yes.
VALA
And what does this have to do with the tablet?
DANIEL
See, the tablet talks about a treasure, but it doesn't make any
specific reference at all to where it is.
VALA
Well it is supposed to be here. That's what the person who I stole
it from told me...
[The three men give her interrogating looks.]
VALA
...before I stole it from him.
DANIEL
Well, I think it is here, and I think I know where it is, too.
MITCHELL
(makes timeout gesture)
All right, time out. If the tablet doesn't say...
DANIEL
(getting excited)
It doesn't say, specifically, but it...It is signed, by a guy named
Myrddin.
[Daniel looks at the others, excited and expectant. No one else knows
what he's talking about.]
MITCHELL
Never heard of him.
DANIEL
(stuttering in excitement)
I-I think you have. And the amazing part is, his name also appears
in the database.
TEAL'C
The Ancient who carved this tablet is one of the Ancients who
returned to Earth from Atlantis?
DANIEL
Yes.
MITCHELL
(skeptical)
I have an Uncle Marvin. I'm pretty sure I don't know any Myrddins.
DANIEL
(still speaking fast and stuttering)
Uh...That's because his name in English sounds a little different.
It...have you heard of...Merlin?
MITCHELL
Merlin? King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table? Merlin?
DANIEL
Yes.
MITCHELL
Was an Ancient?
DANIEL
I think so.
MITCHELL
(ponders for a moment, then, to Teal'c)
See, THAT is what I'm talking about!
[Daniel and Mitchell both look excited. Teal'c and Vala both look
puzzled.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[The room is dark. Mitchell, Landry, Vala, and Teal'c are all seated
around the table. Daniel is standing at one end of the room, conducting
a power point presentation on the history of the Arthurian legend. As
Daniel talks, Landry's eyes glass over.]
DANIEL
(speaking very quickly)
...Arthur was then carried off in a barge by Merlin, saying that he
was headed for the Vale of Avalon, which according to legend, was a
magical place where the dead would meet. Now at the time, some said
Arthur never actually died but would in fact one day return. From
what we know about the Ancients, it's possible that Avalon was
actually a place where Merlin helped Arthur, a mortal, ascend.
TEAL'C
Are not the Ancients forbidden from interfering with the existence
of mortals?
[Landry sighs at Teal'c's question.]
DANIEL
Ascended Ancients, yes, for the most part. But it's possible Merlin
was not actually ascended himself, but was in fact, just a human,
far along on the evolutionary path.
LANDRY
What does this have to do with where this alleged treasure was
buried?
DANIEL
Well, there are a number of conflicting interpretations, but certain
threads point to the Knights of the Round Table gathering great
treasures from the far corners of Arthur's domain and hiding them in
a magical stronghold at Avalon.
[Vala sits up with interest at the talk of treasure.]
MITCHELL
Including the Holy Grail.
DANIEL
(nods)
According to some.
VALA
(calculating)
So this grail. What's that worth?
[Mitchell turns to look at her with contempt.]
VALA
What?
DANIEL
(ignoring Vala)
In 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have found the
grave of King Arthur. On the stone burial was an inlaid lead cross
was the inscription: "Hic Iacet Sepultus Inclitus Rex Arturius in
Insula Avallonis." "Here lies the famous King Arthur, buried on the
Isle of Avalon." Now the claim was not taken seriously until 1278,
when Henry II ordered the grave to be exhumed. Now Glastonbury, a
small town about 125 miles west of London has been a pilgrimage for
believers since.
[Vala looks bored now that the talk has veered away from the treasure.
Landry looks annoyed and confused at Daniel's translations. Landry gets
up and approaches Daniel.]
LANDRY
Yes, yes. And the point is?
[Mitchell rises when the General stands, but Landry waves to him to sit
back down as Daniel hastens to explain. An image of a green hill with a
tower on top of it is on the screen.]
DANIEL
Certain Celtic legend says that Glastonbury Tor, the hill
overlooking the town, is actually hollow. And that contained within
it is the entrance to the underworld, Avalon.
LANDRY
Has no one ever done any sort of geological survey?
DANIEL
There have been several scientific studies apparently disproving the
myth--
LANDRY
(impatient)
Jackson--
DANIEL
(speaking over him)
We're talking about the Ancients, sir. It's very possible that the
underground entrance was concealed with some sort of technology.
MITCHELL
Sir, we're hoping to use the Asgard sensors aboard the Prometheus to
find something we haven't been able to see before.
LANDRY
Thank you! Well, two years ago, I wouldn't have believed we'd find
an Ancient outpost under a mile of ice in Antarctica. I'll call the
President. I'm sure he'll want to inform the British prime minister.
[Landry turns on the lights to the briefing room and leaves to enter
his office. Mitchell gets up and approaches Daniel.]
MITCHELL
(excited)
That was fantastic! You talk to Carter yet?
DANIEL
Uhh, yeah. She can't make it.
MITCHELL
What? This is huge! We could be on the brink of another major
discovery of Ancient technology here.
DANIEL
Look, I'm sure she'll be interested in whatever we find.
[Daniel pats Mitchell on the shoulder and beats a hasty retreat.
Mitchell looks frustrated. Vala wraps her arm around Mitchell's and
leads him out of the room.]
VALA
Hmm. Try playing hard to get.
MITCHELL
Man, look who's talking.
EXT--IN SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[Prometheus is in orbit around the Earth.]
INT--PROMETHEUS GEAR-UP/LOCKER ROOM
[Daniel, Teal'c and Mitchell are in a locker room gathering gear.
Mitchell tosses Daniel his vest, and Daniel puts it on as they talk.]
MITCHELL
So what do you reckon the range of those things is?
DANIEL
Well, Dr. Lee seems to think we need to stay within a 100 feet or
so. More than half an hour outside that boundary, we begin to feel
the effects.
MITCHELL
You know, if we do find something, I'm thinking maybe Teal'c and I
should check it out.
[Teal'c gives Mitchell a side-long glance of disapproval.]
DANIEL
Uhh, I missed the Daedalus because of this. If we find a secret
Ancient base, I'm going.
MITCHELL
It means we've got to take her with us.
DANIEL
Good point.
MITCHELL
Look, I want you there, you know that. I'm just thinking we could
stay in radio contact.
VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER
Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, please report to Auxiliary Control Room
Two.
[Mitchell, Daniel and Teal'c grab weapons and head out of the locker
room. Neither Daniel nor Teal'c look happy.]
INT--PROMETHEUS, AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM TWO
[Marks and other personnel are manning various stations in the room.
Teal'c, Daniel, and Vala enter. Vala stops, turns and stands close to
Daniel, who is still checking his weapon and other gear. Their
positions block the doorway, and Mitchell is unable to enter the room.]
VALA
Ah, now this brings back memories.
DANIEL
How's that?
VALA
Isn't this where I beat you up?
DANIEL
(looking around)
No.
VALA
No, I'm pretty sure that (gestures) right there is where I crushed
your--
[Vala reaches up and caresses Daniel's cheek. Mitchell shoves his way
between Vala and Daniel, pushing them apart.]
MITCHELL
All right, excuse me, kids. Marks, what do you got?
MARKS
Well, thanks to the Asgard sensors...
[Marks skids across the floor in his rolling chair to another station]
MARKS
...we were able to map around the energy distortion that would have
normally fooled deep ground sonar. I was able to define a large main
cavern, a network of tunnels, and some smaller caves.
MITCHELL
Well done, Lieutenant.
[Mitchell claps Marks on the shoulder.]
VALA
(bending over close to Marks)
Can you see what's in there, say large piles of precious metals?
[Marks is slightly discomfited by the close presence of Vala,
particularly when her bodice is now eye level to him. Daniel reaches
down and pulls Vala upright by the scruff of her neck, then pats her
shoulder briefly.]
MARKS
Uh, like I said, we could only map the exterior of the structure.
MITCHELL
Can you get us (pointing on the screen)
in there?
MARKS
Well, it's almost a half-mile underground, and there's no visible
access from the surface.
DANIEL
Asgard beams.
MARKS
Tried that. Doesn't seem to penetrate whatever sort of energy shield
is disguising the caves.
VALA
Rings.
[Everyone looks at her.]
VALA
The Ancients were the Gate Builders, right? And they invented the
rings too. They had to get in and out of there somehow, and I know
this ship has rings. It's how I--
DANIEL
Yeah, yeah. Good times, good times. She's right, though.
MARKS
If there are rings down there, we should be able to lock on. But
your radios won't work.
[Daniel and Mitchell exchange looks. Mitchell crosses the room,
clapping Daniel on the shoulder in sympathy as he passes.]
MITCHELL
Looks like we're all going.
MARKS
You'll be on your own.
MITCHELL
(to Vala)
Ladies first.
VALA
(to Daniel)
Well then, after you.
[Daniel pauses for a moment, decides not to rise to the bait, and exits
the room. Vala follows.]
MITCHELL
(to Teal'c while exiting)
Come on. This is fun, right?
[Teal'c shakes his head and follows the trio.]
INT--AVALON CHAMBER
[Rings swoop down, depositing Mitchell, Teal'c, Daniel and Vala into a
large dark cave. Presumably, it is Mitchell's first time to travel by
ring transport.]
MITCHELL
Wicked!
(swoops flashlight around)
And empty.
[Mitchell starts exploring the cave. Vala follows.]
VALA
Well, I haven't been this disappointed since Daniel and I had sex.
[Daniel stops short at her statement, as does Teal'c, who shines his
light on Daniel in surprise. They exchange expressions in the darkness
before following Vala and Mitchell. All four walk up a small staircase
where a large stone altar is located. As they approach, a beam appears
which leaves a large sword embedded in the stone.]
MITCHELL
A sword in a stone.
VALA
What's that supposed to mean?
DANIEL
Well, King Arthur once pulled a sword from a stone as proof of his
righteousness and royalty.
MITCHELL
Excalibur.
DANIEL
Actually, that's a common misconception. See, Excalibur was forged
by the Lady of the Lake at Avalon, but it wasn't given to King
Arthur until after the sword he pulled from the stone broke in
battle.
[Mitchell grins and spits in his palms, rubbing them together. He
approaches the sword and tries to pull it out to no avail, groaning
with the effort.]
VALA
(whispering to Teal'c)
Give it a try, Muscles, I'll give you half.
[Teal'c looks at Vala, who's still smiling and nodding encouragingly.
Mitchell grunts and releases his hold on the sword.]
MITCHELL
Okay, yeah, that's in there pretty good.
[Immediately after Mitchell steps back from the stone, a noise is heard
that puts the three men on alert, readying their weapons. A hologram
appears of an old, white-bearded man, dressed in long robes and holding
a long staff.]
MERLIN HOLOGRAM
Welcome, ye knights of the round table, men of honor, followers of
the path of righteousness. Only those with wealth of knowledge and
truth of spirit shall be given access to the underworld, the
storehouse of riches of Ambrosius Aurelianus. Prove ye worthy, and
all shall be revealed.
[Mitchell has moved around the stone to get a closer look at the
hologram. When the message is finished, the hologram disappears, and
Mitchell runs his foot over the dirt where the image stood. Vala's face
lit up at the hologram's mention of riches. Teal'c moves away from Vala
and begins to explore more of the cave. Daniel meanwhile, is thinking
about the message.]
DANIEL
(awed)
That's incredible. Certain scholars have speculated that Ambrosius
and Arthur were one and the same, but that would have made him 74
years old at the Battle of Mount Badon. It's actually quite
fascinating. See, Ambrosius was the son of the Emperor
Constantine...
[Vala approaches the stone and sits on it, playing her hand across the
sword hilt. When she thinks no one is paying attention, she attempts to
pull the sword out herself with no success.]
VALA
(frustrated and dismissive)
Yes, yes, yes. "Fascinating" is the one thing it's not. How do we
prove ye worthy and get all to be revealed?
DANIEL
I have no idea, but something tells me "truth of spirit" might be a
problem for you.
VALA
(irritated)
You know nothing about me.
DANIEL
Because everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie.
MITCHELL
DON'T make me separate you two.
[Daniel and Vala look away from each other.]
TEAL'C
(from further in the cavern)
Perhaps there is something in these tunnels.
MITCHELL
See, that is why he's here. Genius. We're going to split up. I'm
with Teal'c. Yo! Wait up.
[Mitchell hastens to join Teal'c, leaving an annoyed Daniel and Vala by
the sword in the stone.]
INT--AVALON CAVES
[Mitchell and Teal'c move down a long, darkened tunnel, using
flashlights to see.]
MITCHELL
I guess it would have been too easy for them to just leave their
stuff laying out in the open.
[Teal'c remains silent.]
MITCHELL
Maybe it's just me, but I'm digging this rapport developing between
the two of us.
[Teal'c pauses slightly in his step at Mitchell's comment but makes no
other response.]
INT--AVALON CAVES
[Daniel and Vala are moving down a different, dark tunnel, using their
flashlights to guide them.]
VALA
You should give me a weapon.
DANIEL
Nope.
VALA
There could be some sort of icky creature down here left behind to
protect the treasure.
DANIEL
For hundreds of years?
VALA
Some sort of stasis or hibernation. What if it senses our presence
and awakens hungry for human flesh?
DANIEL
That doesn't quite sound like the Ancients' style.
VALA
(sighing)
Still..
DANIEL
I'm sure if there is a monster down here, it's going to be much more
scared of you than you are of it.
(pauses)
Especially once it gets to know you.
[Daniel keeps moving as Vala stops and pouts at his comment.]
INT--AVALON TUNNEL TEAL'C AND MITCHELL ARE EXPLORING
[Teal'c and Mitchell come to a small chamber at the end of the tunnel.
A stone altar is centered in the chamber. As they approach, flames
ignite from small round objects set in the floor. Teal'c appears
disturbed. Mitchell smiles and approaches the altar, cautiously viewing
the room for any danger.]
MITCHELL
(at altar, motioning to Teal'c)
Check this out.
[Teal'c enters the chamber cautiously, scanning behind him to the
entrance. A moment later, a large stone slab lowers behind him, sealing
both he and Mitchell in the room. Both try and stop the slab before it
reaches the floor, but do not succeed.]
MITCHELL
Okay, that can't be good.
(into radio)
Jackson, come in. Jackson, can you hear me?
INT--AVALON TUNNEL DANIEL AND VALA ARE EXPLORING
[Daniel and Vala have reached the end of their tunnel and find a
similar chamber to the one discovered by Mitchell and Teal'c. As they
approach, the flames in their circular nests on the floor again wink
into existence.]
DANIEL
If you immediately know the candlelight is fire...
VALA
Huh?
DANIEL
Nothing.
VALA
Hmm.
[Daniel and Vala enter the chamber. As soon as they pass the threshold,
a large stone slab lowers to the floor. It has already sealed them in
by the time Daniel approaches and checks its weight. Vala looks forlorn
for a moment at being trapped, then runs her light around the room.
There is also a stone altar in their alcove, on which two covered pots
set. One pot is silver, the other gold.]
DANIEL
(sighing)
Okay, the hologram said that "only those with the wealth of
knowledge and truth of spirit will pass." This has to be a test.
[They approach the altar. In front of each pot is a caption written in
Ancient. Vala gestures to the gold pot with her flashlight.]
VALA
What does it say?
DANIEL
It says "the universe is infinite."
VALA
That seems "infinitely" not useful. How about this one?
DANIEL
"The treasure is in this pot."
VALA
Really? I was hoping for something a little more substantial, but
okay...
[Vala reaches for the lid, but Daniel stops her, raising his finger in
warning.]
DANIEL
Wait, wait, wait.
VALA
Too obvious?
DANIEL
Give me a minute.
[Daniel tries to think the puzzle through. Vala pauses for two seconds,
then grunts and again reaches for the lid of the pot. Daniel waves his
hand at her again, halting her movement.]
DANIEL
Not a minute.
(pregnant pause)
Still not a minute.
INT--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER IN THE AVALON CAVES
[Eight stone squares labeled with symbols are set into tiny
indentations on the stone altar. Below the eight squares is a caption
written in Ancient. Mitchell is studying the altar as Teal'c runs the
light from his flashlight along the walls and ceiling of the alcove.]
MITCHELL
All right. I am assuming this is some kind of puzzle. Can you read
this writing?
[Teal'c moves over to the altar and looks at the Ancient writing.]
TEAL'C
No.
MITCHELL
(disappointed)
Well, I think we're supposed to arrange the stones in some sort of
order. What do you think?
[Teal'c looks back at the slab covering the entrance. He aims his
automatic weapon and fires repeatedly at the stone, causing Mitchell to
jump and aim his own weapon. When Mitchell realizes Teal'c is only
firing at the stone slab, he becomes very agitated, bouncing on his
feet.]
MITCHELL
(agitated and angry)
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man! Bullets bounce!
[Mitchell emphasizes this by using his finger to demonstrate a
ricochet, looking like he's drawing a 7 in the air, twice. He shakes
his head and returns his attention to the puzzle. Teal'c meanwhile
begins to grin as he studies his colleague's discomfiture. Mitchell
glances back at Teal'c and is annoyed at Teal'c's expression. He sighs
and takes the eight symbols out of their recessed places.]
INT--DANIEL AND VALA'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
[Daniel is still standing and thinking, holding his finger up in a
gesture of wait. Vala has moved so that she is on the other side of the
altar from him, getting very antsy.]
VALA
Okay, how about this? We open both of them. Whichever one the
treasure's in is the right one.
DANIEL
No, I think that's the wrong idea. There's two pots here, I think
the point of the exercise is to only open one pot.
VALA
This says, "treasure is inside."
DANIEL
Right. Which makes it the obvious first choice.
VALA
So, over to the gold--
DANIEL
No.
VALA
Back to the silver then.
DANIEL
No. D-D-Don't.
[Before he can stop her, Vala lifts the lid on the silver pot.]
VALA
It's empty.
[Daniel is glaring at Vala, slack jawed.]
VALA
(disappointed)
There's nothing I hate more than a bold faced lie.
(She slams the lid down, puts her hand on her hip and sighs)
Okay.
[She reaches for the gold pot's lid, but Daniel grabs her arm with one
hand and points his weapon at her with the other.]
DANIEL
(stuttering in anger)
Wou...Would you stop!
VALA
What? We're already trapped in here. How much worse can it get?
[A low rumbling is heard. They both look up as dust starts falling. The
ceiling is beginning to lower on top of them.]
DANIEL
How about that much?
VALA
(shaking her head, contrite)
I knew it was a mistake the moment I said it. The moment.
INT--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
[Mitchell places the blocks in a combination in the indented places.
When the last one is in place, he pauses for a second, but nothing
happens.]
MITCHELL
Okay. That didn't work.
[They hear a rumbling. Teal'c looks around and notices the dust
starting to settle from above as the ceiling begins to lower.]
TEAL'C
Indeed.
MITCHELL
Oh, come on!
[Teal'c and Mitchell both desperately pull the blocks back out of the
indentations to try another combination.]
INT--DANIEL AND VALA'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
[Vala pulls her arm away from Daniel and opens the gold pot in
desperation.]
VALA
This one's empty too!
DANIEL
I know!
VALA
That doesn't make sense!
DANIEL
I KNOW!
INT--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
[Mitchell is placing the blocks in places as fast as he can. Teal'c is
pressing on the ceiling above his head, trying to physically prevent
the ceiling from lowering further.]
TEAL'C
(grunting with effort)
Colonel Mitchell!
[Mitchell glances around to see if the combination he tried worked.
Immediately, he starts pulling out the blocks to start once again.]
MITCHELL
Two down, and only a billion possible combinations to go.
TEAL'C
(grunting)
Are you still having fun, Colonel Mitchell?
[Mitchell spares a momentary glance at Teal'c before continuing to work
on the puzzle.]
INT--DANIEL AND VALA'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
VALA
So what do we do?
[Daniel looks up as he realizes the ceiling is already touching the top
of his head.]
DANIEL
I don't know!
VALA
You don't know!?! So now is a bad time to tell you that I hate small
spaces!?!
[Daniel bends over since he can no longer stand up straight and sighs
deeply, glaring at Vala.]
INT--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES
[Teal'c still tries to push against the ceiling without success as
Mitchell keeps working on puzzle combinations]
MITCHELL
Do you ever get a bad feeling about something?
