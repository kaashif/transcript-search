TEASER
INT--SGC, GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[O'Neill walks up and knocks on the door.]
HAMMOND
Come in.
O'NEILL
General, I'd like to talk to you about this mission upon which we
are about to embark. Seems a bit...ridiculous doesn't it?
HAMMOND
Have you met General Ryan?
RYAN
Hello, Colonel.
O'NEILL
The General Ryan? Chief of Staff?
RYAN
That's right.
[O'Neill looks stunned.]
O'NEILL
(low, to Hammond)
Shouldn't there have been a memo or something?
HAMMOND
You were off world.
O'NEILL
Ahh yeah. So what brings you to our little secret base, sir?
RYAN
That would be the ridiculous mission you just mentioned.
O'NEILL
Of course.
HAMMOND
I'm proposing that M4C-862 become a permanent research station. I'd
like you to make an assessment.
O'NEILL
The General Ryan?
RYAN
I've read a lot about you, Colonel, from General Hammond's reports.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir?
RYAN
Thus far we like your work.
O'NEILL
Thank you, sir. I like yours. Your Air Force. The Air Force. I love
the Air Force.
HAMMOND
Anything else Colonel?
O'NEILL
No, sir. Well, actually I'd like to know how Daniel and Carter got
out of this...very important mission?
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson is offworld with SG-11. Major Carter is giving a lecture
at the Air Force Academy in theoretical astrophysics. If you'd care
to take her place...?
O'NEILL
No.
HAMMOND
Then you're dismissed.
O'NEILL
Thank you, sir. Sirs. Si...Both of you.
[O'Neill leaves.]
RYAN
Got your hands full with that one, eh, George?
INT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY
[In front of a whiteboard covered in mathematical equations. Carter is
giving a lecture.]
CARTER
...so as a result of these modular functions, the unwanted variables
are always expressed as multiples of N minus 10. Therefore if we
assume the existence of 10 dimensions in space-time, the variables
are cancelled out, and the calculations suddenly begin to make
sense.
CADET
Excuse me, ma'am. Did you say ten dimensions?
CARTER
Yes, I did. Look, I realise these concepts are a little bizarre, and
that many of you cadets would rather be somewhere else right now,
jump school, flight training. Believe me I know. I used to sit in
those chairs and listen to the same boring lectures. No offence,
Professor.
[The students laugh.]
CARTER
But on the other hand, the aerodynamics that are one day going to
allow you to fly an F-22, started out as squiggles on a board just
like this one. These calculations are the key to opening up the
entire universe. Wormholes and hyperspace may seem like science
fiction, but take my word for it, the future is a lot closer than
you might think.
[The students clap. Students start to leave the lecture hall. One
student, Hailey, walks around to look at the whiteboard as Carter is
packing her things, talking to Professor Monroe.]
CARTER
I guess that wasn't so bad.
MONROE
No, no you actually made the topological configurations of multiple
dimensions seem interesting.
HAILEY
This is wrong.
MONROE
What's that, Cadet?
HAILEY
I'm sorry, sir, but the calculations are incorrect.
MONROE
I appreciate your enthusiasm, Cadet, but perhaps you should wait
until you graduate before you start criticising the work of a leader
in the field of astrophysics.
HAILEY
Yes, sir, of course. My apologies, Ma'am.
[Carter looks at the calculation Hailey was studying.]
CARTER
Who was that?
MONROE
Jennifer Hailey. Very intelligent, but er, difficult personality.
CARTER
Well, she's right.
MONROE
Really?
CARTER
These variables should be reversed.
MONROE
I didn't even notice.
CARTER
Neither did I.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--M4C-862, DAY
[A temporary camp and laboratory is set up in the sandy foreground.
Trees and woodland visible beyond. A purple gas giant takes up half the
sky, and there are two moons although it is day. O'Neill and Teal'c
approach a small group of soldiers.]
GRIFF
Colonel.
O'NEILL
Major. Report.
GRIFF
Well, we've had a pretty thrilling week. Two days ago Dr Thompson
lost his glasses. And just this morning the electron microscope
broke down.
O'NEILL
Wow.
GRIFF
Yeah. Nonstop excitement.
O'NEILL
Well, we'll take it from here. You're relieved.
GRIFF
Sir.
HAMILTON
Major Griff?
GRIFF
Dr. Hamilton.
HAMILTON
Do you realise that we still haven't received those replacement
parts for the back-up generator?
GRIFF
I put the requisition in three days ago.
HAMILTON
Well, that's just not good enough. We obviously need to have a
serious talk about our supply procedure.
GRIFF
Well, unfortunately Doctor, I've just been relieved. But...I'm sure
Colonel O'Neill would love to discuss it with ya.
[Griff turns his back on Hamilton and grins at O'Neill, clapping him on
the shoulder as his team leaves.]
O'NEILL
Love is the word.
HAMILTON
Colonel O'Neill, is it? I don't know if this is a military thing
generally, or just Major Griff's incompetence, but I can't seem to
get anything I ask for.
[O'Neill and Hamilton walk off.]
EXT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY, DAY
[Cadets jog in formation across the campus]
AIRMAN
Your left. Your left. Your left, right, left.
INT--GENERAL KERRIGAN'S OFFICE
[Carter knocks on the door. Kerrigan is reading a report.]
KERRIGAN
Come.
(He looks up from his report.)
Samantha, Sam. Good to see you again. Come in, sit down, sit down.
CARTER
It's good to see you too, sir. Thank you.
KERRIGAN
Well, well, well. So, how was the lecture?
CARTER
Well, uh, no one fell asleep.
KERRIGAN
Very impressive.
CARTER
Thank you, sir. I did have an interesting encounter with one of your
cadets. Jennifer Hailey.
KERRIGAN
Caught your eye did she? I thought she might.
CARTER
She pointed out a mistake in a complex equation that changed the
result completely. I couldn't believe it.
[Kerrigan hands Carter a report entitled 'Towards a New Cosmology of
Multiple Realities.' by Jennifer Hailey. A red D is marked in the spot
for the paper's grade.]
KERRIGAN
Here, give this a read. Once you brush the chip off her shoulder,
she reminds me of another bright young cadet who came through here a
few years back.
CARTER
I've no idea who you're talking about, sir.
KERRIGAN
Cadet Hailey is a very smart young woman, her SATs were through the
roof, even higher than yours. Unfortunately she's sometimes too
smart for her own damn good.
CARTER
Professor Monroe said she has discipline problems.
KERRIGAN
The kid's bored. Came here for a challenge but it's not enough for
her.
CARTER
Not enough? This is just the beginning of her career. How could she
possibly know what's ahead for her?
KERRIGAN
I know, but she doesn't see it, Sam. Don't get me wrong, I mean, I
see her potential, her physical skills are terrific despite her
size. She's an expert marksman, superb glider pilot, but that's not
all there is to becoming an Air Force officer. If she keeps
insisting on doing things her own way, then..
CARTER
I'd like to talk to her, if that's okay?
KERRIGAN
I was hoping you'd say that.
EXT--M4C-862, DAY
[Scientists Hamilton and Lee are talking outside the lab next to a
MALP.]
HAMILTON
Who said that?
LEE
He did.
HAMILTON
Oh for...
[Hamilton walks over to O'Neill who is sitting on some crates looking
through binoculars.]
HAMILTON
Colonel O'Neill, Dr. Lee tells me you've denied our request to
conduct a survey of the cave network?
O'NEILL
No. I just asked him to wait until I could have a chance to check it
out.
HAMILTON
With no regard for our timetable.
O'NEILL
None whatsoever.
HAMILTON
Colonel, what exactly do you expect to find in there?
O'NEILL
Look, Doctor, this is another planet.
HAMILTON
Actually, it's a moon. We're orbiting that gas giant.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Oh well, if it's a moon, go ahead, do whatever you want. What could
happen?
HAMILTON
Colonel, this outpost has been up and running for six weeks now
without the slightest hint of anything remotely dangerous.
O'NEILL
You can explore the caves once they've been checked out. Any more
pressing matters?
HAMILTON
None whatsoever.
[Hamilton walks away muttering.]
HAMILTON
(to himself, but audible to O'Neill)
It's hopeless.
O'NEILL
(to himself)
Oh yeah?
INT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY LAB
[Hailey is working on a neon laser beam. Carter walks in, unnoticed.]
CARTER
It's beautiful, isn't it?
HAILEY
Major Carter.
CARTER
At ease, Cadet. Getting in a little extra lab time?
HAILEY
Yes, ma'am.
CARTER
I wanted to talk to you about the term paper you did for Professor
Monroe: 'Towards a New Cosmology of Multiple Realities.' It's an
interesting topic.
HAILEY
Professor Monroe gave me a D.
CARTER
Because it wasn't the assignment.
HAILEY
Permission to speak freely, ma'am?
CARTER
(nodding)
Mm-hmm.
HAILEY
The assignment was lame.
CARTER
Maybe it was, but it was the assignment.
HAILEY
You read it anyway?
CARTER
Matter of fact I did. It's intriguing.
HAILEY
The same word Professor Monroe used.
CARTER
Maybe because that's what it is. An intriguing idea. But it's based
on way too many unfounded assumptions to make a valid theory. For
example, you assume that matter can travel both ways through an open
wormhole.
HAILEY
So?
CARTER
So, how do you know?
HAILEY
Well, until somebody shows me a real wormhole that can only go one
way...
CARTER
That's not the point. You made an assumption.
HAILEY
(irritated)
What about your assumption, Major? That you're the one that's right
and I'm wrong?
CARTER
Cadet, that paper is way, way beyond anything you're likely to be
taught at the Academy. And if you want points for it, hey, we're all
impressed. It doesn't mean you don't do the assignment.
HAILEY
I'm late for a class, ma'am. Am I dismissed?
CARTER
Yes.
[Hailey leaves the room.]
EXT--WOODLAND ON M4C-862, DAY
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking through the woods. O'Neill contacts
Hamilton on the radio.]
O'NEILL
Hamilton?
INT--RESEARCH LAB
HAMILTON
Colonel O'Neill. How are the caves?
EXT--WOODLAND ON M4C-862, DAY
O'NEILL
Dark.
HAMILTON
(sarcastically)
No subterranean monsters, I assume?
O'NEILL
(irked)
Not this time. Go ahead and do your survey.
HAMILTON
Thank you.
[O'Neill ends the radio conversation.]
TEAL'C
You seem disappointed we found nothing, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
No it's just you know I wanted him to be wrong just so he'd be
wrong. And if he was wrong, then we'd have something to do.
TEAL'C
I see.
[There is a noise. Teal'c and O'Neill stop walking and listen.]
O'NEILL
You hear something?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[They look around and spot a tiny gold glowing light which flies out of
the woodland and circles around them before zipping off through a
tree.]
TEAL'C
I have never before encountered anything like it.
O'NEILL
Cool.
INT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY LECTURE HALL
[Professor Monroe works at a table at the front. Carter walks into the
hall and down towards him.]
MONROE
I didn't realise you were still here.
CARTER
I wanted to talk to you about Cadet Hailey's paper.
MONROE
Sam...
CARTER
Look, at first I agreed with you. It just didn't add up. But there
was something about it that kept nagging at me. I finally figured
out what it was. The equations don't make sense unless you allow for
variations in the speed of light.
MONROE
Which is a universal constant.
CARTER
Not if you expand the frame of reference to include multiple
universes. That's where this paper comes in. I think without even
realising it, Cadet Hailey intuitively arrived at a whole new way of
looking at cosmology.
[Carter starts to write on the whiteboard.]
CARTER
Under certain special circumstances, what we would see as an effect
preceding a cause would in fact be an effect following a cause in a
parallel reality.
MONROE
That's assuming that parallel realities occasionally overlap.
CARTER
I'm fairly confident that that's the case.
MONROE
Really, why? I know she's got to you, but I think you're trying hard
to see something that isn't there.
CARTER
All right. Even if this theory ultimately proves to be incorrect,
you have to admit that it's a brilliant insight.
MONROE
Jennifer Hailey is no longer our problem.
CARTER
What do you mean?
MONROE
She got into a fight this morning with another cadet. As fond as
General Kerrigan is of her, he'll have to expel her.
EXT--M4C-862 ENCAMPMENT
[The scientists are walking out from the temporary lab.]
LEE
Are you sure this is such a good idea?
HAMILTON
Hey I didn't come half way across the galaxy to wait for permission
to do my job.
LEE
I know, but Colonel O'Neill...
HAMILTON
Colonel O'Neill doesn't have a clue what we're trying to accomplish
here, he's too busy polishing his M-16.
[The scientists unknowingly walk past O'Neill and Teal'c are sitting,
who are sitting against some crates.]
O'NEILL
Actually, it's a P-90.
[The scientists turn, caught. O'Neill smiles and indicates his weapon.]
O'NEILL
You boys going somewhere?
HAMILTON
Ahh, yes, we-we were going to go see if we could find that creature
you encountered.
O'NEILL
Well, apparently you didn't hear me the first time I told you,
clearly, and in no uncertain terms, not the heck yet.
LEE
You-you know, if your description is correct, we're talking about
something that can pass right through solid matter.
O'NEILL
Yes, and therefore, logically, we have no defence against it.
HAMILTON
This is typical military thinking. You encounter something you don't
understand, and you immediately assume it's a threat.
O'NEILL
(standing and moving towards Hamilton)
Well, until we determine there is no threat, I will assume there is
one. Do we have a problem here?
HAMILTON
Colonel, with all due respect. Really. When I agreed to this
assignment I was under the impression that I was going to be in
charge.
O'NEILL
You are in charge. Of the other scientists.
HAMILTON
That you even think you are even qualified to decide what we can and
can't do around here is...
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill is indeed qualified, Dr Hamilton, having encountered
many alien species, as have I, long before you were born. I strongly
suggest you do what Colonel O'Neill says.
O'NEILL
Thank you, Rocco. Boys, we'll be in touch.
[O'Neill walks past the scientists towards the woodland. Teal'c
follows.]
EXT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY, KERRIGAN'S OFFICE
[Kerrigan faces the window, then turns to Carter as he speaks.]
KERRIGAN
Cadet Hailey was helping to train an underclassman named Chloe Brown
who is having problems with her physical fitness tests. Apparently
one of the cadre made a derogatory comment about the young lady.
Cadet Hailey told him to knock it off.
CARTER
And when he didn't?
KERRIGAN
She broke his nose.
CARTER
She what?
KERRIGAN
I can't let that go. I don't give a damn how smart she is.
CARTER
She was defending a fellow classmate.
KERRIGAN
I know.
CARTER
I'm not asking for her to go unpunished, sir. But if she's even half
as brilliant as I think she is, we don't wanna lose her.
KERRIGAN
We're not here to make advancements in theoretical physics, we're
here to defend this country.
CARTER
I understand that, sir, but they're not mutually exclusive goals.
KERRIGAN
Can I assume you're referring to your research project up at
Cheyenne Mountain?
CARTER
You can.
KERRIGAN
Deep space radar analysis, is it?
CARTER
Something like that, sir, yes.
KERRIGAN
Umm. Well, I don't know what it really is you're working on inside
that mountain, but I do know if you've got something to do with it,
then it's high priority.
CARTER
Well, thank you, sir, it is. And believe me when I tell you Cadet
Hailey is exactly the kind of person we need.
KERRIGAN
She'll have to be punished.
CARTER
As she should be, sir. But I don't think she's about to go on a
rampage beating up upperclassmen.
KERRIGAN
(into intercom)
Send her in.
[Hailey enters and salutes.]
HAILEY
Sir, Cadet Hailey reports as ordered.
KERRIGAN
At ease. Major Carter?
CARTER
Cadet, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Answer honestly.
HAILEY
Yes, ma'am.
CARTER
Who the hell do you think you are?
HAILEY
Ma'am?
CARTER
Do you think you're better than we are? Do you think you're too good
for the Air Force?
HAILEY
No, ma'am.
CARTER
Oh, come on, all those little rules and regulations, they don't
really apply to you right? I mean let's face it, what's the point of
a chain of command if none of your superiors are as smart as you
are?
HAILEY
I don't feel that way, ma'am.
CARTER
Oh, I think you do. And I think deep down, you want to leave. Let me
do you a favour. The door's open. Why don't you just quit and go
home?
HAILEY
No, ma'am. I won't quit.
CARTER
I'm just giving you the chance to walk out before General Kerrigan
throws you out.
HAILEY
I won't quit.
[There is a slight pause.]
CARTER
Good.
[Carter turns to Kerrigan.]
KERRIGAN
Cadet Hailey, as far as I'm concerned you've demonstrated a
remarkable inability to be a functioning member of the United States
Air Force. But Major Carter has a future in mind for you, and I
respect Major Carter's opinion. Although the rest of your punishment
stands, I'm not recommending dismissal.
HAILEY
Thank you, sir.
KERRIGAN
You may go.
[Hailey salutes then leaves.]
KERRIGAN
Good luck.
[Carter makes a face and groans.]
EXT--AIR FORCE ACADEMY CAMPUS, DAY
INT--ACADEMY CORRIDOR
[Carter walks along with Hailey. They stop and face each other.]
CARTER
What were you thinking, breaking the nose of an upperclassman like
that?
HAILEY
Aim high?
CARTER
That's not funny.
HAILEY
No, ma'am, you wouldn't think so, would you?
CARTER
What's this got to do with me?
HAILEY
Everything. The great Samantha Carter. You think a day goes by in
this place when I don't hear your name? You've gotten the highest
mark in every class I've ever been in; you've won every award I've
ever been up for. They've been comparing me to you since the day I
walked through the door, and I never quite seem to measure up.
CARTER
That's it? What, so for the first time in your life you come to a
place where you are not automatically the smartest and best at
everything you do? Get over it. There are important things at stake.
HAILEY
You've got my future all planned out for me as long as I stay here?
CARTER
If you're good enough.
HAILEY
Like what? Flying a transport plane if I'm one of the lucky ones? I
don't see this exciting future you're talking about, Major.
CARTER
Something more incredible than anything even YOU could imagine.
HAILEY
(near tears)
Yes, ma'am.
[Hailey walks off. Carter calls to her.]
CARTER
Cadet. Believe me.
[Hailey turns back and looks at Carter with a skeptical but hopeful
expression.]
EXT--M4C-862 ENCAMPMENT, DAY
INT--INSIDE RESEARCH LAB
[Hamilton and Lee are examining test tubes.]
HAMILTON
Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority.
Now how can we do that when the greatest scientific discovery in
human history is in the hands of the United States Air Force?
[The buzzing of the alien life form is heard. Lee looks up in shock.]
LEE
Oh my God.
[A tiny glowing light is hovering near the ceiling. Hamilton sees it.
It flies between them.]
HAMILTON
The camera. The camera, get the camera, get the camera.
[The light flies around Hamilton then flies through the metal wall and
outside. Lee and Hamilton race after it.]
EXT--M4C-862 ENCAMPMENT, DAY
[Thompson is working next to the MALP. He spots the light just as Lee
and Thompson burst through the doors. They all stop and watch the being
as it flies around, then vanishes.]
HAMILTON
Come on.
[The scientists run after it into the woodland.]
LEE
(into radio)
Colonel O'Neill.
EXT--M4C-862 WOODLAND, DAY
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking through the woodland.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Go ahead.
LEE
(over radio)
We just encountered another one of the creatures. We're following it
into the forest north of the camp.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Let's go.
[O'Neill and Teal'c run towards the scientists' position.]
EXT--M4C-862 WOODLAND NORTH OF CAMP, DAY
[In a clearing, the scientists are standing watching several of the
light 'bugs'. Lee holds a video camera and is taping the entitites.]
HAMILTON
Incredible.
[Hamilton walks towards the swarm as O'Neill and Teal'c run into the
clearing.]
O'NEILL
Hamilton, what are you doing?
[Hamilton is standing among the alien light bugs.]
HAMILTON
(smiling)
You see, Colonel, they're harmless.
[Hamilton laughs as several of the bugs circle his open palm. O'Neill
watches with concern.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hailey stands in the briefing room looking around with open
curiousity. A guard stands near her by the briefing room window. The
blast door is shut so she cannot see into the gate room. She notices
Hammond watching her through his office window and stiffens.]
INT--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond watches Hailey through the star chart etched window gravely.
Carter is with him.]
HAMMOND
Major, this is a high security area.
CARTER
I know that, sir, but she's already checked out security and signed
the non-disclosure form.
HAMMOND
What did you tell her she was going to see?
CARTER
Deep space radar telemetry.
HAMMOND
Are you absolutely sure about this, Major?
CARTER
General, she is a perfect candidate for the SGC.
HAMMOND
(skeptically)
Her file says otherwise.
CARTER
I've met her, sir. She is brilliant.
HAMMOND
Not everyone is cut out to be an Air Force officer, Major.
CARTER
Sir, if she can just get one glimpse of her possible future, she
will graduate at the top of her class and become an officer worthy
of serving under your command. I am absolutely sure about this, sir.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28
[Carter and Hailey are walking through the corridor, geared up for
offworld travel. Sound of Gate klaxons sound in the background.]
HAILEY
I don't understand. We're underground. Where could we possibly be
going?
CARTER
You'll see. What you're about to see is probably the best kept
secret in the world.
HAILEY
You're making me nervous.
CARTER
Good. Because from this point on everything you thought you knew
about the universe is about to be turned upside down.
[They stop outside Gate room door.]
CARTER
You ready?
[An SF opens the door.]
INT-SGC GATE ROOM
[Carter and Hailey walk into the Gate room. The Stargate is dialling.]
HAILEY
What is it?
CARTER
It's your future. It's called a Stargate.
HARRIMAN
Chevron Seven locked.
[The wormhole appears into the room and Hailey jumps.]
CARTER
You're looking at the event horizon of a wormhole connecting this
Stargate to another identical one on another world forty-two
thousand light years from Earth.
HAILEY
That's where we're going?
CARTER
That's right.
HAILEY
How?
CARTER
That's the easy part. Come on.
[They step through the Gate.]
EXT--M4C-862 STARGATE, DAY
[Carter and Hailey exit the Stargate.]
HAILEY
What was that? What just happened?
CARTER
Your body was particalised in the matter stream and then
reintegrated.
HAILEY
So this is another planet?
CARTER
It's a moon, actually.
HAILEY
Doesn't look that different from home.
CARTER
Well, where there's oxygen, there's usually plant life, trees,
water. There are a couple of differences.
[She gestures upwards with her chin. Hailey looks up and sees two
moons. Also seen is a hazy view of a gas giant taking up half the sky.
Carter smiles as Hailey looks at the sky in shock. O'Neill walks up to
them.]
O'NEILL
Hey, Carter. Thought I'd come be your welcoming committee.
CARTER
Thank you, sir. How are you?
O'NEILL
Ah, the back's acting up a little actually. The knees, you know,
always...
CARTER
Sir, I'd like you to meet Cadet Hailey.
[Hailey stands at attention and salutes O'Neill, who casually returns
the gesture.]
O'NEILL
Cadet. Welcome to 862. How was your trip?
HAILEY
It was a...a trip, sir.
O'NEILL
(smiling) It always is.
(To Carter)
I got something you should see.
[Carter, O'Neill and Hailey approach the lab.]
INT--RESEARCH LAB
[Carter and Hailey look at a light bug trapped in a container. O'Neill
and Teal'c sit behind them. Hamilton stands on the other side of the
container.]
CARTER
What is it?
HAMILTON
We're not sure, but we think it's some kind of energy based life
form.
HAILEY
That's impossible.
HAMILTON
Yeah, that's what we thought but one of them led us directly to the
others, which suggests organisation, some kind of intelligence. They
also appear to be able to phase through solid matter.
O'NEILL
Yeah, Teal'c and I saw one zip right on through a tree. Didn't even
slow it down.
HAILEY
That's so cool.
O'NEILL
That's exactly what I said. I said that.
CARTER
If that's the case, what's keeping it inside this cylinder?
HAMILTON
That was Dr. Lee's idea. The top and bottom plates are electrified.
The field seems to be holding it in.
HAILEY
You're not hurting it are you?
HAMILTON
Heh. The creature has no physical body, I don't think it's capable
of feeling pain.
CARTER
But if it's intelligent, it might not appreciate being held in a
cage.
O'NEILL
Might be time to let this one go, Doc.
HAMILTON
Colonel, no, please, we need to study it.
O'NEILL
Find another way.
[Hamilton releases the light bug. It vanishes through the ceiling.]
EXT--M4C-862 CLEARING, DAY
[Thompson uses some monitoring equipment to scan the area of a woodland
clearing.]
LEE
(over radio)
Hey Bill, come in. Any sign of the swarm?
THOMPSON
(keying radio)
Nothing yet. Looks like they just disappeared.
EXT--M4C-862 FOREST, DAY
[Lee wanders around the forest path, looking around for more of the
creatures.]
LEE
(over radio)
Listen, they've got to be around here somewhere. Try checking for
high frequency spikes.
EXT--M4C-862 CLEARING, DAY
THOMPSON
(keying radio)
You got it.
EXT--M4C-862 FOREST, DAY
[Lee continues to explore the area along the path.]
EXT--M4C-862 CLEARING, DAY
[A light bug approaches Thompson. He looks up from his equipment,
startled to find the creature so close to him.]
THOMPSON
Oh, hey there. We're your friends.
[The light bug buzzes near him in an aggressive manner. Thompson stops
pointing the scanning equipment at it and raises his hand, palm
outward.]
THOMPSON
Whoa, whoa, easy, I'm not going to hurt you.
EXT--M4C-862 FOREST, DAY
LEE
(into radio)
Bill, you getting anything on the high frequency?
EXT--M4C-862 CLEARING, DAY
[The light bug goes through Thompson's hand. He drops the scanner. It
goes through the center of his body and he grunts and doubles over in
pain. More light bugs appear and swarm around. Thompson watches them
with increased alarm.]
EXT--M4C-862 FOREST, DAY
LEE
Bill, come in.
THOMPSON
(in the distance)
Arrrghhhh.
[Lee immediately moves towards the cries.]
EXT--M4C-862 CLEARING, DAY
[Thompson lies on the ground, attacked by light bugs flying around and
through him. He is covered in red marks where the beings have passed
through his body. Lee runs into the clearing.]
LEE
Oh, God.
[Lee keys his radio.]
LEE
Colonel...
[One of the creatures zips through his hand, causing him to drop the
radio and cry out in pain. He looks back at Thompson, who is
desperately trying to reach towards him from the ground. The creatures
continue to zip through Thompson's body. Lee looks around panicked for
a moment before running away.]
EXT--M4C-862 ENCAMPMENT, DAY
[Scientists work on various equipment. Hailey passes them curiously and
approaches Teal'c.]
HAILEY
Teal'c. Do you mind if I call you Teal'c?
TEAL'C
I have no other name.
HAILEY
So, I'm guessing you're not...
TEAL'C
Human? Then your guess is correct.
HAILEY
Then is this your planet? I mean, moon.
TEAL'C
It is not. My home world is called Chulak.
HAILEY
Your world? Wait a second, how many places does the Stargate go?
TEAL'C
The Stargate network is composed of a great many worlds.
HAILEY
Are you serious?
[Lee runs up, clutching his injured arm.]
LEE
Colonel O'Neill! Colonel O'Neill! Colonel O'Neill! Help! Colonel
O'Neill!
[O'Neill and Carter run out from the lab. Hamilton and others follow.]
O'NEILL
What?
LEE
(panting)
It's Dr. Thompson. Those things are attacking Dr. Thompson.
O'NEILL
Where?
LEE
Back in the clearing where we first encountered them.
O'NEILL
Carter, get them inside. Teal'c with me.
CARTER
Go, go, go.
EXT--M4C-862, DAY
[O'Neill and Teal'c run into the woodland. They find Dr Thompson. He's
obviously dead.]
INT--RESEARCH LAB.
[Carter dresses Lee's wound from where the light bug attacked him.
Hailey and Hamilton watch. O'Neill bursts inside, Teal'c follows.]
O'NEILL
Hey! Just what about my radio transmission did you not understand?
Let's go!
CARTER
Just finishing up, sir.
HAMILTON
What happened to Dr. Thompson?
O'NEILL
He's dead. Let's move.
EXT--M4C-862, ENCAMPMENT, DAY
[They all run outside the lab.]
HAMILTON
Colonel. Colonel, we don't know what happened out there, this might
be an isolated incident; the creatures may have been provoked.
O'NEILL
Maybe. Let me ask you this, why take a chance?
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
[Teal'c indicates a massive swarm of the light creatures approaching.]
O'NEILL
All right, back inside.
[They all run inside.]
INT--RESEARCH LAB
TEAL'C
These walls will not protect us O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Carter, we've got about 15 seconds.
CARTER
I don't know, sir, zats maybe?
O'NEILL
Maybe?
CARTER
Well, I just got here. Zats deliver an electrical charge; they're
the only weapon I can think of that we have that might have an
effect.
O'NEILL
All right, everybody get down.
[Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill activate their zats. Light bugs enter the
lab. Carter fires at a group. Another group attacks Hamilton. Teal'c
shoots Hamilton, and the bugs disperse. O'Neill fires at another group
near the ceiling. The light bugs retreat.]
[Later...]
[Everyone closes the metal slats at the windows. Carter checks various
jumper cable connections attached to the aluminium walls. Teal'c
watches the door.]
CARTER
We've wired up the aluminium walls of this building, when we switch
on the current it might create enough of an electrical field to keep
them out the same way Dr. Lee's containment vessel kept them in.
EXT--M4C-862, DAY
[The light bugs swarm outside the research lab. Teal'c spots them and
closes the door.]
INT--RESEARCH LAB
TEAL'C
They are returning.
O'NEILL
Light it up.
CARTER
Stand clear of the walls.
[Carter switches on the circuit breaker, and the metal building is
electrified. Occasional zaps are heard as light creatures are repelled
outside.]
HAILEY
It's working.
CARTER
As long as we've got power we're safe.
LEE
How long do you think the generator will keep running?
HAMILTON
I'm not...I'm not sure.
O'NEILL
You're not sure? Who refuelled it last?
HAMILTON
Dr. Thompson. I'm sure he filled it sometime this morning.
LEE
No, we don't know that.
HAMILTON
That would give us another eight or so hours.
TEAL'C
But you cannot be certain.
LEE
No.
O'NEILL
All right, where is it?
HAMILTON
It's on the other side of the compound. Down by the creek.
LEE
Basically, it could run out at any time.
[Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c study an aerial view map of the area.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
I think I may have a way out of here, sir. The creatures are being
held back by the electrical field around the building. What we need
to do is create a field big enough to repel them from the entire
area.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
CARTER
The Stargate, sir. It's a giant superconductor. Once activated, the
field it generates would be more than enough.
O'NEILL
So somebody's got to go down there and dial out.
TEAL'C
Anyone attempting to reach the Stargate would most certainly be
killed.
CARTER
Not necessarily. Now, the human body has an electrical field of its
own. Do you remember what happened when Dr. Hamilton was hit by
Teal'c's zat fire? The creatures must have left his body because his
body's electrical field was temporarily altered.
O'NEILL
How long would it last?
CARTER
I don't know, sir.
HAILEY
Shoot him again.
TEAL'C
A second shot from a zat'nik'tel kills.
CARTER
It's just a guess, sir. I'm not even sure you would make it to the
Gate before you were vulnerable again.
O'NEILL
Hey, why'd they attack in the first place?
CARTER
I suppose it's possible they were reacting to the capture of one of
their own.
HAILEY
That's not it.
O'NEILL
What?
HAILEY
I've been going over Dr. Thompson's astronomical observations. Did
you know this moon wasn't even formed from the original accretion
disk of the planet?
O'NEILL
No. But I suspected.
HAILEY
(indicating on a blackboard)
Dr. Thompson thinks it was a rogue that got pulled into a highly
eccentric polar orbit. A planet's magnetic field emanates from the
poles, it's where it's the most intense. According to Dr. Thompson's
observations, we entered into the polar phase of the orbit a couple
of days ago, about the same time the creatures were first
encountered. And they became violent right at the moment we were
directly over the pole.
CARTER
It's possible, sir.
O'NEILL
Go on.
HAILEY
Well, we're beyond the point of peak intensity. If we wait, the
creatures will go back to the way that they were before.
O'NEILL
How long would that take?
HAILEY
A couple of hours, no more than that.
TEAL'C
The generator will most likely not last that long.
HAILEY
We'll hold them off with those phaser things.
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
What do you think?
CARTER
Well, sir, if I'm right and their behaviour is retaliatory, waiting
will just make things worse.
HAILEY
You're not right. I am.
CARTER
You don't know that, Cadet.
HAILEY
We know the creatures are affected by electric fields. You think
it's just a coincidence that they happened to go berserk just as
we're passing over the pole?
CARTER
Do you think it's a coincidence that they attacked us en masse
immediately after one of their own was captured? Sir, we can't both
be right, the theories are mutually exclusive. Now there's certainly
evidence to support both but not enough to reach a conclusion.
HAILEY
Colonel, please don't just dismiss what I'm saying because you
expect her to be right.
O'NEILL
It doesn't matter who's right, Cadet.
HAILEY
Colonel, you're risking your life for nothing.
O'NEILL
Decision's made.
[O'Neill walks off.]
HAILEY
How can it not matter who's right?
CARTER
If he makes a run for the Gate, he's risking his own life. If he
waits, he risks everyone's life.
He can't do that.
[O'Neill prepares to leave.]
O'NEILL
As soon as I get the Gate open, head straight for it. Don't bring
anything with you.
HAMILTON
Oh, no. We can't leave behind weeks of research.
O'NEILL
Carter, if he so much as brings a file folder, shoot him.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
TEAL'C
Are you ready, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
No. Give me a warning.
[Teal'c activates a zat and aims at O'Neill]
TEAL'C
I am going to shoot you.
O'NEILL
I was thinking more along the lines of "on three". One...
[Teal'c shoots O'Neill with the zat. O'Neill collapses to the floor.
Lee waves an ammonia capsule by his nose.]
O'NEILL
(in a great deal of pain)
Two...God, I said on three. God.
[Teal'c and Lee help O'Neill to his feet. He is still disoriented and
in pain from the zat blast. Teal'c hands O'Neill a zat.]
TEAL'C
Good luck, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Wish me luck.
CARTER
Good luck, sir.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
(indicates the power switch)
Go.
[Carter cuts the power to the electrical field. O'Neill opens the door
and starts running out of the lab, towards the Gate. Carter switches
the power back on in the lab.]
EXT--M4C-862, DAY
[O'Neill runs through the undergrowth chased by a swarm of the light
bugs. He pauses as the light bugs reach him and crouches in defense.
Light bugs swarm around him but don't attack. O'Neill arrives at the
Stargate and approaches the DHD.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
I'm at the Gate. I'm going to start dialling.
INT--RESEARCH LAB
[Carter and Teal'c exchange concerned looks.]
EXT--M4C-862,BY STARGATE, DAY
[O'Neill starts to dial the chevrons in. As he dials Chevron Four, the
light bugs start to attack him. He drops his zat and dials two more
chevrons before falling to the ground.]
CARTER
(over radio)
Colonel! Colonel!
[A zat blast near the DHD scatters the light bugs. Teal'c stands nearby
holding a zat.]
TEAL'C
Quickly, O'Neill.
[O'Neill finishes the dialling sequence. The Gate activates. The light
bugs vanish into the woodland.]
O'NEILL
I'll never complain about mosquitoes again.
[A short time later, the entire expedition arrives at the active
Stargate.]
LEE
We owe you our thanks, Colonel.
O'NEILL
I s'pose.
HAMILTON
And I owe you...an apology.
O'NEILL
I suppose you do.
[The scientists, O'Neill and Teal'c go through the Gate. Carter and
Hailey stop in front of the event horizon.]
HAILEY
Is it always like this?
CARTER
No, sometimes it gets really exciting.
HAILEY
Will I ever find out which one of us is right?
CARTER
If you stick around long enough, maybe. Besides there'll always be
other planets.
HAILEY
It's a moon.
CARTER
Okay, you're right about that.
FADE OUT
