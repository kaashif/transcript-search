TEASER
EXT--SPACE
[The International Space Station is orbiting Earth.]
COSMONAUT
(in Russian)
God, it's so big! Object is moving at 12 meters per second.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and a female officer are sitting at a monitor, listening to the
exchanges in Russian. Daniel enters.]
DANIEL
What's going on?
CARTER
It's our Russian team on the International Space Station. They're
adjusting the orbit to avoid some debris left over from our little
incident in Antarctica.
[The female Russian officer speaks to the astronaut who can now be seen
on the monitor. The astronaut cranes to look out of a viewport. The
monitor shows the trajectory of two large craft in space.]
EXT--SPACE
[Space debris is getting nearer to the International Space Station.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The astronaut is still looking out of the viewport and speaking to the
female officer at the SGC. The Russian officer smiles.]
COSMONAUT
(in Russian)
Everything's normal. We escaped collision.
FEMALE RUSSIAN OFFICER
(to Carter)
It worked.
[Carter nods and smiles. The astronaut continues to talk.]
COSMONAUT
(in Russian, sarcastically)
What's even more strange...
[Carter look at the Russian officer, but she appears unwilling to
translate and looks at Daniel.]
DANIEL
He said, if the Americans want to keep blasting alien ships out of
orbit they've got to do a better job of tracking their own mess.
[The Russian astronaut, still looking out of the viewport, mutters to
himself. Suddenly, the signal is lost. The Russian officer speaks in
Russian and types on the keyboard, obviously trying to reinstate
contact. The monitor shows the message 'Signal Lost'.]
CARTER
What's going on?
FEMALE RUSSIAN OFFICER
I don't know. We lost contact.
EXT--SPACE
[An energy force enters the Space Station.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is sitting at his desk, doing paperwork. The desk is covered
in files and folders. There is a knock at the door.]
O'NEILL
Come in.
[An SF opens the door. An uniformed officer enters and comes to
attention.]
RUSSIAN OFFICER
General O'Neill. It is an honour to meet you and may I say, an even
greater honour to finally serve under your command.
O'NEILL
Wow! That was a load.
[The Russian officer looks confused.]
O'NEILL
Who are you?
VASELOV
I am Colonel Alexi Vaselov, Sir. I assumed you were expecting my
arrival.
[O'Neill looks at his desk, covered in paperwork.]
O'NEILL
Uh...yeah, sure. Um...
[He selects a folder from the desk and shows it to Vaselov.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, here's the memo. Right there.
VASELOV
I want you to know, Sir, that I personally requested this transfer.
After my many years of service with Russian Air Force I...I feel
confident that I can make a positive contribution to Stargate
Command.
O'NEILL
Great.
[Vaselov smiles uncertainly.]
VASELOV
If I may be so bold, Sir. I understand that with your recent
appointment as base commander, a position has become available on
SG-1.
[O'Neill raises his eyebrows, sighs quietly and looks down.]
VASELOV
I would, of course, relish the opportunity to serve on the SGC's
elite team.
O'NEILL
Yes. You and everyone else on this base.
[O'Neill looks up at Vaselov.]
O'NEILL
Colonel? Not going to happen.
[Vaselov again smiles.]
VASELOV
I understand your reluctance, Sir, but if you look at my record, I
think it will satisfy any of your concerns. I have over 3000 flight
hours on more than 35 types of aircraft and prototypes. In addition,
I have been awarded the High Order of Russia, the Gold Star and
numerous...
O'NEILL
Yes, yes. That's very impressive. Very. But it's not going to get
you on SG-1.
VASELOV
Understood. I am, of course, willing to accept a position on a
different team.
O'NEILL
Colonel, until you go through the proper training you're not going
anywhere near that Gate.
VASELOV
Perhaps I could assume a role as a non-combat observer on one of the
exploration units, Sir.
O'NEILL
It was nice meeting you. Very nice. You're dismissed.
[O'Neill waves his hand at Vaselov, who stands at attention and leaves.
O'Neill blows out a breath.]
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Teal'c, Daniel and Carter are in the office.]
TEAL'C
If all goes according to plan, barring any unforeseen circumstance,
I will acquire possession of my apartment on Tuesday.
CARTER
Hey, congratulations.
DANIEL
So, when's the apartment warming party?
[Teal'c looks at Daniel, bemused.]
DANIEL
Uh...when someone gets a new place it's customary for them to throw
a party.
TEAL'C
Would I be required to prepare a meal?
CARTER
No, make it pot luck. We'll all bring something.
TEAL'C
Very well, next Saturday.
[Teal'c smiles. O'Neill enters the office and Carter shoots to her
feet, at attention.]
O'NEILL
I'm only going to say this once, Carter. At ease.
[Carter nods sheepishly.]
DANIEL
So how's the new job?
O'NEILL
Oy! One crisis after another. This morning, the mess got a shipment
of Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the usual Russets.
DANIEL
No!
O'NEILL
Oh yes! The Golds don't make for good mash. Consistency's all wrong.
[Daniel nods, eyebrows raised.]
CARTER
I hear the new Russian Colonel came to see you, made a pitch to join
SG-1.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
DANIEL
What did you say?
O'NEILL
Told him to make french fries instead.
DANIEL
About the Russian.
O'NEILL
Oh! Well, I made it clear he shouldn't expect preferential
treatment, that he'd have to prove himself before I'd consider him
for offworld travel.
CARTER
He is one of the most highly decorated officers in Russian military
history, and he has over 20 years flight experience.
O'NEILL
And exactly no years in offworld travel. I'm not going to risk the
lives of anyone under my command on a slick resum.
CARTER
How uncharacteristically cautious of you, Sir.
O'NEILL
Yes. There's that.
DANIEL
There's also the fact that the Russians must be pressuring you to
put him on the team.
O'NEILL
Yes! There's that too.
[O'Neill points at Daniel.]
DANIEL
You can't exactly blame them. We haven't been making good on our
promises.
O'NEILL
We gave them their own team!
DANIEL
That was two years ago. I mean, what have we done for them lately?
O'NEILL
Forget it! I'm not putting him on SG-1.
TEAL'C
Do you have someone else in mind for the position, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
So we're sticking with the three man team.
O'NEILL
Why not? It's one less decision I have to deal with.
CARTER
There's nothing in the regulations that says an SG team has to be
made up of four people.
O'NEILL
(to Daniel, gesturing)
There you go! Problem solved.
[Daniel raises his eyebrows and grimaces.]
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Thank you.
INT--SGC VASELOV'S QUARTERS
[Vaselov stands in front of a mirror to button his jacket. He looks
down at his left arm and pulls up the sleeve. His lower arm is covered
in lesions. There is a knock at the door and Vaselov moves to open it.
Daniel stands in the doorway.]
DANIEL
Colonel Vaselov.
[Daniel puts out his hand, to shake Vaselov's hand.]
VASELOV
Doctor Jackson. Of course, come in.
[Daniel enters the room as Vaselov shuts the door.]
VASELOV
Your reputation precedes you. I'm well acquainted with your work.
DANIEL
I just wanted to come by and welcome you to the neighbourhood.
VASELOV
That's very kind of you. I only wish others were as open to my
presence here.
DANIEL
Yeah, don't take General O'Neill's decision personally.
VASELOV
It's difficult not to. Frankly, his attitude is offensive. It leads
me to wonder if he knows the cold war is over.
DANIEL
Yeah, his attitude has nothing to do with you being Russian. He's an
equal opportunity offender.
[Daniel grins.]
VASELOV
And I am supposed to find this comforting?
[Vaselov smiles, though he seems to not be amused.]
DANIEL
Uh...he doesn't respond well to outside pressure.
VASELOV
Our nations are supposed to be partners in the Stargate Program.
DANIEL
Yes, I'm well aware of the deal, Colonel, I helped broker it.
VASELOV
Well then, you more than anyone can understand our frustration.
DANIEL
Okay.
[Daniel turns away from Vaselov.]
DANIEL
What you have to realise is, Colonel O'Neill...General O'Neill just
assumed command of this facility and uhhh...and he's got a lot on
his plate. Quite frankly, making demands on him right now is just
bad timing on the part of your government.
[Vaselov appears unwell.]
DANIEL
Colonel?
[Vaselov collapses.]
DANIEL
Colonel!
[Daniel crouches down to Vaselov, who is propped against a cupboard.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Vaselov is lying on a gurney, being wheeled down the corridor by two
male nurses. Daniel is following.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[They enter the infirmary. A female doctor is standing at an occupied
bed but comes across to the gurney.]
BRIGHTMAN
What happened?
[Daniel is standing in the doorway.]
DANIEL
I don't know. We were just talking and all of a sudden he just
collapsed.
BRIGHTMAN
All right. I know you're scheduled to go offworld, we'll take care
of him.
[The gurney is wheeled away. Daniel looks at his watch and leaves.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[The corridor, personnel and voices are distorted as the image moves
down the corridor.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY OBSERVATION ROOM
[O'Neill walks around the corner to enter the observation room.
Brightman is standing in the room.]
O'NEILL
How's he doing?
BRIGHTMAN
Confused.
[O'Neill and Brightman stand, looking down into the infirmary where
Vaselov is lying in a bed. His lower arms are bandaged. The bed is
surrounded my monitors and nursing personnel are in the room.]
BRIGHTMAN
Apparently the last thing he remembers is being in Russia. He
doesn't know where he is or how he got here. He's also exhibiting
certain physical symptoms which have me concerned. He has lesions
over 40% of his body and a highly elevated white blood count which
indicates some sort of infection.
O'NEILL
Is he contagious?
BRIGHTMAN
It's a distinct possibility. Sir, we need to examine everyone who's
been in contact with this man.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate opens. Daniel is standing at the bottom of the ramp with
an SG team. As they make their way up the ramp, the Stargate closes
down.]
O'NEILL
(over intercom)
Daniel!
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
(into microphone)
Report back to the infirmary.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[As the final member of the SG team walks down the ramp, Daniel grabs
him around the throat. The SFs in the room reach for their weapons.]
DANIEL
Open the Gate! Do it. Now!
[Daniel has a gun at the team-members' side.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill turns from the window and grabs a weapon from a nearby SF. He
leaves the room.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Daniel shoots both SFs as O'Neill appears in the doorway. As Daniel
and his hostage make their way off the ramp, Teal'c, who is standing in
the other doorway, shoots Daniel with a zat. Daniel collapses. As
Teal'c nears, Daniel slowly climbs to all fours. His weapon is lying on
the ground nearby.]
O'NEILL
Daniel!
[Daniel grabs the weapon and, rising to his knees, points it at
O'Neill. O'Neill shoots Daniel who again collapses to the floor. As
O'Neill walks over to him, Daniel loses consciousness. O'Neill and
Teal'c look at each other in shock.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is lying on a bed, unconscious. He has a nasal cannula and his
left arm is in a sling. A couple of monitors beep away at the head of
the bed.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY OBSERVATION ROOM
[Brightman, Teal'c, O'Neill and Carter are looking down at Daniel.]
BRIGHTMAN
He's lost a lot of blood but his life is no longer in any immediate
danger.
CARTER
The members of SG-11 insisted he seemed perfectly normal.
(to O'Neill)
Did you notice anything peculiar about him, Sir?
O'NEILL
I thought it odd he was shooting up the Gate room.
TEAL'C
He reacted immediately after the Gate was shut down.
BRIGHTMAN
Why was he so desperate to go through?
CARTER
Does he have any of Colonel Vaselov's symptoms?
BRIGHTMAN
No lesions yet but that may just be a matter of time. He does have
an elevated white blood count.
TEAL'C
Yet Colonel Vaselov displayed no unusual behaviour.
BRIGHTMAN
That doesn't necessarily mean they're not suffering from the same
condition. If an infection reaches the brain it can manifest itself
in a variety of ways, from memory loss to full blown psychosis.
O'NEILL
You don't think it's a coincidence?
BRIGHTMAN
Seems unlikely, Sir. I think there's a high probability that we have
a contagion on the base.
[O'Neill looks down at Daniel.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
(to technician)
Contact all teams that are offworld. Tell them the SGC is off
limits. Have them proceed to the Alpha Site until further notice.
Effective immediately, the SGC is under lockdown.
EXT--ENTRANCEWAY
[As a number of SFs run inside, the huge door slowly closes. A red
alert alarm is sounding.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Brightman is walking down the corridor, reading a medical chart.
Carter comes up to her.]
CARTER
Hi. How's Daniel?
BRIGHTMAN
He's still unconscious but he's improving. He's responding well to
treatment and his white cell count is coming down.
CARTER
What about Colonel Vaselov?
BRIGHTMAN
It's not so good. We're treating him with antibiotics but his
condition is deteriorating. Until we know more about the source of
the infection there's not much else we can do.
CARTER
Well, since it started with Vaselov we can be pretty sure it didn't
come through the Gate.
BRIGHTMAN
I'm waiting to here back from the Russians about possible sources of
the infection from their end.
CARTER
Anyone else showing symptoms?
BRIGHTMAN
Not yet.
[Brightman walks away.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN. NIGHT
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is sitting by Vaselov's bed, reading a computer printout.]
VASELOV
How is he? Doctor Jackson? Doctor Brightman told me what happened.
[Vaselov has a nose cannula and appears weak.]
TEAL'C
His condition is improving.
VASELOV
Good.
TEAL'C
And your condition?
VASELOV
Not so good. But not so bad as the time I went drinking with General
Dashkaivitch in Novgorad. That was worse headache.
[Vaselov smiles slightly. Teal nods his head at him.]
VASELOV
Doctor Jackson is good friend of yours, yes?
TEAL'C
Indeed he is. Despite what you are thinking you bear no
responsibility for what has transpired.
VASELOV
My presence here has resulted in the quarantine of this entire
complex.
TEAL'C
Had you remained in your homeland you would have faced a similar
situation only in a different setting. Again, through no fault of
your own.
VASELOV
Perhaps. But at the moment I can't be sure of anything.
[Vaselov grimaces in pain.]
TEAL'C
Has your memory not yet returned?
VASELOV
In my dreams, I have begun to see flashes. Glimpses of these past
few days. Walking these halls, talking to people. And yet it is as
if I am not even here. I'm just a helpless observer inside my own
body.
INT--BRIGHTMAN'S OFFICE
[Doctor Brightman passes a file to Carter. Teal'c is standing next to
Carter.]
BRIGHTMAN
One month ago Anatoli Constantinov fell ill after completing a tour
on the International Space Station.
CARTER
I remember. We monitored the mission, we lost contact for almost
thirty seconds and we never figured out why.
BRIGHTMAN
Well, I don't know if they're connected but he died less than a week
later in a Moscow hospital. Now, officially, the cause of death was
renal failure but unofficially the Russian authorities haven't a
clue what killed him.
CARTER
You think it might be our mystery disease?
BRIGHTMAN
Among the symptoms he exhibited were memory loss, skin lesions, and
a highly elevated white blood count.
TEAL'C
Is there any connection with Colonel Vaselov?
BRIGHTMAN
Apparently Vaselov visited Constantinov in the hospital just before
he died. They were old friends, they served together in the Russian
Air Force.
CARTER
Why didn't they tell us this?
BRIGHTMAN
The Russians are determined that Constantinov's condition wasn't
contagious. He came into contact with many people between the time
he returned to Earth and the time he checked into the hospital, but
no-one else ever showed any signs of being infected.
CARTER
It makes it an oddly selective disease.
TEAL'C
Perhaps we are not dealing with a disease at all. Colonel Vaselov
possessed only vague, random memories of his time at Stargate
Command, and yet the incidences he could recall he described himself
as a mere observer to the actions of his body.
BRIGHTMAN
Like being host to a symbiote.
CARTER
Yeah, but tests ruled out the possibility of a Goa'uld.
BRIGHTMAN
Could we be looking at some other form of alien possession?
CARTER
Yeah, it's possible. An entity capable of moving from individual to
individual. It might explain some of the inconsistencies.
BRIGHTMAN
If that's true, it could be in anyone right now.
[Carter sighs. The phone rings and Brightman walks away to answers it.]
BRIGHTMAN
(into phone)
Hello? I'll be right there.
[She puts the phone down.]
BRIGHTMAN
(to Carter and Teal'c)
Daniel's awake.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[The blast doors open as Brightman, O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c enter.]
DANIEL
Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on?
[Brightman walks over to Daniel, who is sitting on the side of the bed,
arm in a sling.]
BRIGHTMAN
You're recovering from a gunshot wound.
DANIEL
What?
TEAL'C
You have no recollection of the incident?
DANIEL
No! Who shot me?
O'NEILL
Don't...change the subject. What do you remember?
DANIEL
I went to see Colonel Vaselov, and right in the middle of our
conversation he collapsed...and...I went to help him, and...that's
it.
CARTER
You don't remember accompanying him to the infirmary?
DANIEL
No! Who shot me?
[Carter quickly nods her head slightly towards O'Neill, who looks at
her sideways. Teal'c also looks at O'Neill, who again looks sideways at
Teal'c. Daniel looks at O'Neill, slowly becoming aware of who shot him.
O'Neill grimaces and shrugs.]
O'NEILL
You were shooting up the Gate room.
CARTER
You wounded two guards.
[Daniel looks at them, bemused and questioning.]
CARTER
We think we may be dealing with a foothold situation. Specifically,
an alien entity capable of taking over human hosts, not unlike the
Goa'uld. And it seems to be able to travel from person to person.
TEAL'C
Although at present we have no knowledge of how this is possible.
[Daniel looks away from his team-mates, worried.]
CARTER
Daniel?
[A bright flash of light shows that Daniel is experiencing a flashback.
He sees his hand holding a gun and shooting one of the SFs in the Gate
room. The flashback ends.]
DANIEL
Anubis.
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
It was Anubis.
[O'Neill and Carter look at Daniel, worried.]
DANIEL
Or rather, Anubis was controlling me.
O'NEILL
Anubis is dead.
DANIEL
No, he's not. And he's here in the base.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are sitting at the Briefing Room table.]
O'NEILL
You'd think that getting blasted out of orbit would have slowed the
guy down.
TEAL'C
According to Daniel Jackson Anubis surrendered his mortal form when
he was ascended, only to be cast down by the Ancients. As a result,
he exists purely as an immaterial being.
CARTER
See, in the past when we encountered Anubis, the physical form we
were seeing was actually a force-shield, designed to contain his
essence. When it was destroyed, that essence was released.
TEAL'C
Anubis was trapped in Earth's orbit inhabiting debris from his ship,
millions of light years away from his power base.
O'NEILL
So he hitched a ride on a cosmonaut?
CARTER
Yes, Sir. And then abandoned him for Colonel Vaselov.
TEAL'C
No doubt attempting to escape through our Gate.
O'NEILL
Why doesn't he just use his freaky, super cosmic powers and
just....go.
[O'Neill gestures with his hands.]
TEAL'C
Doing so would alert the Ancients, and only serve to bring down
their wrath upon him.
CARTER
See, in order to interact with the physical world, he has to get
himself a new shield but he can't do that here on Earth. He'll need
a body to dial the Gate and get through.
TEAL'C
Eventually Anubis will attempt escape again.
[O'Neill sighs.]
O'NEILL
Well, he's on the base, obviously not going anywhere.
(to Carter)
Tell me there's something we can do.
CARTER
Well, as a matter of fact, Sir, I think there is.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter, carrying a book, walks past a number of officers queuing in
the corridor.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter enters the infirmary, passes an unconscious Vaselov and walks
up to Daniel, who is lying on the next bed, reading. She hands the book
to him.]
DANIEL
What's going on?
CARTER
General O'Neill has ordered compulsory physicals for all the SGC
personnel. We're operating under the assumption that retaining
Anubis' essence exacts a physical toll on the carrier. You were only
exposed for a couple of hours but your body reacted as though you
were fighting off an infection.
DANIEL
So whoever's retaining his essence should start showing symptoms.
CARTER
Yeah, that's the theory.
DANIEL
What about Vaselov?
CARTER
Well...
[Carter closes the curtain between Daniel's bed and Vaselov's.]
CARTER
...his is a more extreme case. He was exposed for over a week,
that's why his symptoms are more advanced.
DANIEL
You mean with the lesions and the...
[Daniel grimaces.]
CARTER
Yeah, it's actually more than that. His entire immune system was
affected.
DANIEL
But Anubis is out of him, he should start getting better, right?
[Carter looks down, breaking eye contact.]
DANIEL
Sam?
CARTER
Doctor Brightman says he's not responding. She thinks the exposure
may have simply gone on for too long. The damage is done.
DANIEL
There must be something we can do for him.
CARTER
We can help him manage the pain, that's about it.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[The view of the corridor is once again distorted as someone walks to
O'Neill's office.]
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
O'NEILL
I said the situation was contained. I did not say it was resolved.
[O'Neill is on the phone.]
O'NEILL
No, I can't do that!
[Brightman stands in the office doorway.]
O'NEILL
Command will stay under lockdown until I decide otherwise.
[O'Neill notices Brightman and gestures for her to enter, which she
does.]
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir, it is my call. Yes, Sir.
[O'Neill puts down the phone.]
O'NEILL
Pentagon, getting a little antsy.
BRIGHTMAN
They're not the only ones. You've got a bunch of very anxious people
out there.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I'll bet. What can I do for you, Doctor?
[O'Neill sits behind his desk.]
BRIGHTMAN
It's concerning Colonel Vaselov. His condition hasn't improved and
he's not responding to treatment. Unless circumstances change I'd
give him a week, two weeks tops.
O'NEILL
I'll inform the Russians
BRIGHTMAN
Thank you, Sir.
[Brightman leaves the office.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Vaselov wakes.]
VASELOV
Doctor Jackson?
[Daniel is standing by Vaselov's bed.]
DANIEL
Oh, Alexi, sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
VASELOV
No, no. I'm glad to see you are up and about. Are you being
discharged?
DANIEL
Yeah, Doctor Brightman caught me stealing jello from the other
patients' trays so she kicked me out of here.
[Daniel and Vaselov smile.]
VASELOV
Doctor...
[Vaselov removes the nose cannula and tries to sit up. He reaches for
an envelope on a trolley by the bedside.]
VASELOV
I wonder if you could do me a favour. I have a sister in Briansk.
When the lockdown has ended, could you see that she gets this?
DANIEL
Alexi.
VASELOV
The nurses have been careful not to say anything. That is always a
bad sign. Please.
[Vaselov reaches to give the envelope to Daniel, who takes it.]
VASELOV
Da! You know, in Russia, we have a saying...
(Speaks in Russian)
The cord may curl long, but an end will appear. That holds true for
everything in this world, myself included. I accept this.
[Daniel speaks to Vaselov in Russian, smiling gently.]
VASELOV
In the kingdom of hope, there is no winter.
DANIEL
I prefer that one.
VASELOV
Da, it's a nice saying.
DANIEL
I'll come see you.
[Daniel puts the letter down on the trolley and turns away. As he does
so, he sees a nurse wheeling a gurney into the infirmary and has
another flashback.]
[In the flashback, he is lying on a gurney moving along a corridor,
with Brightman and a female nurse walking alongside. The next flashback
shows the nurse dressed in surgical scrubs with a medical mask covering
her lower face. Daniel's hand reaches out to the nurse and Anubis'
essence moves into her. The flashback ends.]
VASELOV
Doctor Jackson?
DANIEL
Lieutenant Evans. He's in Lieutenant Evans.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY
[Evans comes out of the infirmary carrying a tray of food. As she turns
into the corridor she is faced by three SF's pointing guns at her. She
drops the tray and puts both hands up.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM
[Carter is sitting at a table, opposite Evans. A couple of SFs are also
in the room. Evans is being filmed.]
EVANS
I was examined by Doctor Brightman a couple of hours ago. She said I
was fine.
CARTER
It's possible you haven't started manifesting signs yet.
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM OBSERVATION
[O'Neill is sitting in the observation room, looking at a monitor
showing a close-up of Evans and listening to her.]
EVANS
Colonel I would know. If something like that happened to me, I would
know. I'm not lying.
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM
CARTER
Lieutenant, tell me what you did Tuesday afternoon.
EVANS
I don't understand.
CARTER
Just tell me.
[Evans looks down, unable to answer.]
CARTER
Lieutenant ?
EVANS
I don't know.
CARTER
You don't know?
[Evans shakes her head.]
EVANS
I can't remember.
[Carter looks up at O'Neill in the observation room.]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM OBSERVATION
[Teal'c enters the observation room.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill. I have been informed that Airman Malcolm McCaffrey has
missed a scheduled appointment at the infirmary. He remains
unaccounted for.
[O'Neill sighs.]
O'NEILL
(into microphone)
Carter?
[O'Neill leaves the observation room as Carter leaves the interrogation
room.]
INT--SGC CORRIDORS
[SFs are searching corridors and rooms. One SF walks around a corner,
alone, and is thrown against the opposite wall. His attacker takes the
downed man's weapon. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are walking along a
corridor.]
VOICE
(over radio)
General O'Neill
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Yeah. O'Neill here. Go.
INT--SGC ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[The SF who was attacked is helped to his feet by a couple of SFs.]
KEARNEY
(into radio)
This is Major Kearney. I've got a wounded man here, claims he was
jumped by Airman McCaffrey. We think he's headed for the control
room. Advise caution, General. The target is armed.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(into radio)
On our way.
INT--SGC ANOTHER CORRIDOR
[McCaffrey turns a corner and walks up to an SF, shooting him. He goes
up the steps to the control room and places the gun to the back of the
Gate technician.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c quickly follow, running up the steps into
the control room.]
MCCAFFREY
(to technician)
Dial the Gate.
[O'Neill zats McCaffrey, who collapses. As Anubis' essence leaves
mcCaffrey's body, O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter raise their weapons but
don't fire. Anubis' essence goes through a wall.]
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[Daniel walks through the Briefing Room to O'Neill's office and knocks
on the doorjamb. O'Neill is sitting at his desk and looks up.]
DANIEL
Mind if I come in?
[Daniel enters,]
O'NEILL
You're not supposed to be walking around.
DANIEL
It's my arm!
[Daniel sits.]
O'NEILL
You were shot.
DANIEL
I know! You shot me!
O'NEILL
Not the point.
DANIEL
Look, I heard what happened. Anubis is still here.
O'NEILL
Daniel, he can pass through walls. He's welcome to leave the base at
any time.
DANIEL
He has to go through the Stargate, otherwise he's trapped on Earth.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Well, there's not much we can do. Can't kill him.
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
Can't catch him.
DANIEL
No.
O'NEILL
Sooo...
DANIEL
We let the Ancients deal with him.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Yes. Because they've always been so helpful.
DANIEL
If he uses his powers as an Ascended Being, he is breaking the
rules. They will take action.
[Daniel grimaces and rubs his injured arm.]
DANIEL
We just have to take away his other options.
O'NEILL
Uh huh. I assume you have a plan?
[Daniel simply looks at O'Neill in silence as O'Neill raises his
eyebrows at him.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel and Carter are standing in front of a large screen making a
presentation.]
DANIEL
Anubis has now made two attempts to get through the Gate.
[Teal'c, O'Neill, Kearney and another officer are listening to the
presentation.]
DANIEL
Now, in both instances we were able to stop him, but there's no
guarantee we'll be so lucky the next time. We have to take steps to
make it as difficult as possible for him to access the Stargate.
CARTER
To that end, we're proposing a division of the facility into three
separate sections, designated zones one, two and three.
[Carter brings up a 3-D model onto the screen.]
CARTER
Power to the Gate has been shut off, and will no longer be
accessible from the control room. Instead, it can now only be
re-established from a relay centre located here in zone one.
[The screen shows an image of zone one.]
CARTER
The control room, Gate room, and surrounding areas, have been
designated zone two. Intermediate corridors linking the two zones,
will be sealed.
[An image of zone two appears on the screen.]
CARTER
Corridors linking directly to the Gate room will also be sealed. The
only means of unsealing these corridors, will be from a security
control centre, located here in the section designated zone three.
[Carter brings up an image of zone three.]
DANIEL
All personnel will be restricted to one of these three zones.
Standing food and medical supplies will be divided amongst the three
sections. Doctor Brightman's team will be split into three units,
and continue monitoring personnel through daily physical
examinations. Now, no-one, not even General O'Neill, will be
permitted access to a neighbouring zone until lockdown ends.
[Teal'c turns to look at O'Neill.]
CARTER
Any questions so far?
[Kearney raises his hand.]
KEARNEY
With all due respect, Colonel, given everything we know about Anubis
do you really think this is going to stop him?
[Carter looks to Daniel.]
DANIEL
The point is to make it impossible for him to get through the Gate
in the body of any one person. Now, when he realises he can't get
out that way, he'll have no choice but to risk revealing himself to
the Ancients.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN. DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c are in the control room. O'Neill looks at his watch
and shows the time to Teal'c.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
[Carter enters the room and works at a keyboard.]
INT--SGC
[Various blast doors throughout the complex close.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Siler walks through the corridor until he is stopped by a closing
blast door.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
SILER
(over radio and on monitor)
Zone one secure.
[The monitors show other blast doors closing as Carter turns to see a
blast door behind her sealing shut.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Zone three secure.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill stands watching a blast door close.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Zone two secure. Good luck!
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Brightman is examining personnel as an SF stands nearby. Vaselov is
lying in a bed. He wakes as a member of the nursing staff injects into
his IV.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Teal and a couple of SFs are standing guard. They are relieved by
three SFs.]
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is pacing his office, on the phone.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter and a male officer walk down the corridor, studying a notepad
in Carter's hands.]
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[The red phone rings and O'Neill picks it up.]
O'NEILL
O'Neill. Yes, Mr President. Yes, sir, six days without incident.
Yes, all SG personnel present and accounted for.
[Teal'c appears at the door and goes to knock but doesn't as he hears
O'Neill on the phone.]
O'NEILL
No, no-one has shown any physical symptoms, sir, but that doesn't
mean Anubis is gone.
[O'Neill gestures for Teal'c to enter, which he does.]
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c, whispering, hand over receiver)
It's the President.
(into phone)
Well, yes sir, of course I understand the importance of the program,
but I would be...I understand sir.... Hello?
[The President has obviously hung up. O'Neill puts down the phone.]
O'NEILL
I've got 24 hours to re-establish normal...
[O'Neill makes quotation mark signs.]
O'NEILL
...Gate operations.
TEAL'C
It was unreasonable to assume the lockdown could be maintained
indefinitely.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I suppose.
INT--SGC
[O'Neill's voice comes over the PA system.]
O'NEILL
Attention, all personnel. This is General O'Neill. I know the
current situation has been tough on all of you. You've been cut off
from your families, your homes, you're wondering how much longer
this can go on. But the fact is, there's a threat on this base that
cannot be allowed to escape. Knowing that, the President has
authorised me to maintain this lockdown, indefinitely.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill is sitting, making the announcement, watched by Teal'c and
other personnel.]
O'NEILL
(into PA system)
We've only got food enough for another month. So we'll find a secure
way to bring supplies down from the surface. In the meantime, I
suggest you all get comfortable. We're not going anywhere.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[The distorted image of the corridor shows that Anubis' essence is
moving yet again.]
[Carter turns a corner to approach two SFs guarding a door.]
CARTER
(to SFs)
I need to run a diagnostic.
[The guards open the door and Carter enters the room, followed by the
guards who stand near the doorway.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
[Carter works at a keyboard then moves on to type at a laptop computer.
She removes a zat from a leg holster, primes it and shoots the two
guards then returns to work at the keyboard. She exits the room.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Daniel is closing a caged area as Carter walks up to him.]
DANIEL
Hey, Sam.
[Carter zats Daniel.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
[A monitor is showing a Security Override countdown to zero.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter zats an SF.]
[Daniel slowly gains consciousness and gets to his feet. He walks
towards the open doorway of the computer room.]
[A couple of SFs are lying, unconscious, in the corridor. Carter is in
a room which is marked with hazard tape and a High Voltage sign. She is
working on a hand-held computer. The complex's power goes down.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[As the lights go out, then return immediately, Vaselov half sits up in
bed.]
INT--SGC POWER SUPPLY ROOM
[Carter leaves the room.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
[Daniel enters as the two SFs zatted by Carter regain consciousness.
Daniel walks up to the monitors and sees the countdown. One of the
monitors shows a blast door opening and Carter walking through.]
DANIEL
(into radio)
Teal'c, this is Daniel.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Proceed, Daniel Jackson.
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Anubis has got Sam. She's headed your way.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Understood.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Another blast door opens and Carter walks through. The door closes
behind her.]
INT--SGC CORRIDORS
[SFs are running through the corridors. The red alert alarm is
sounding.]
[As an SF runs around a corner, he is zatted by Carter. A second SF is
attacked by her but Carter is zatted by O'Neill. O'Neill walks up to an
unconscious Carter and sees Anubis' essence leaves her.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Jack?
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Go ahead.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Anubis tampered with the security system. He set up a sequence of
timed commands. We're trying to override, but we're not having much
luck.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Keep me posted.
[Kearney and another SF run up to O'Neill who aims his zat at them,
then lowers it.]
O'NEILL
(to SF)
Keep an eye on them.
(to Kearney)
Kearney, you're with me.
[O'Neill and Kearney walk away. O'Neill walks up to the controls of a
blast door and opens it.]
KEARNEY
General?
O'NEILL
Major?
[O'Neill and Kearney enter the room.]
INT--SGC SELF-DESTRUCT CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill walks up to a large unit in the room.]
KEARNEY
Sir?
[O'Neill reaches for the key around his neck.]
O'NEILL
Ready your key.
[Kearney looks shocked.]
O'NEILL
Major, base security is being compromised. Ready your key. That's an
order.
[Kearney reaches for the key around his neck.]
KEARNEY
Yes, Sir.
[Kearney walks to the opposite end of the unit. O'Neill inserts his key
and types on a small keyboard.]
O'NEILL
Counting down. From three, two, one, turn.
[O'Neill and Kearney turn their keys. A countdown starts at five
minutes.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Five minutes to self-destruct. Five minutes...
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter is being escorted by a number of SFs. Hearing the self-destruct
countdown, she elbows the guard behind her in the face and runs off.]
INT--SGC SELF-DESTRUCT CONTROL ROOM
[Kearney turns away from the self-destruct unit, as does O'Neill.
O'Neill faces him.]
O'NEILL
You did good, son.
[O'Neill zats Kearney who collapses, unconscious. O'Neill leaves the
room, taking Kearney's weapon.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Four minutes to self-destruct. Four minutes...
[As Vaselov hears the self-destruct warning, he removes the finger
monitor and takes out the IVs. He gets out of bed.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter comes up the stairs to the control room.]
SF GUARD
(to Teal'c) Sir!
[Teal'c turns and points a zat at Carter.]
TEAL'C
(to Carter)
Come no further.
CARTER
Teal'c, you have to give me access to the base computer. Someone
activated the self-destruct. Let me shut it down.
TEAL'C
You are infected.
CARTER
I was infected. Anubis left me for someone else.
TEAL'C
Of this I cannot be certain.
CARTER
Teal'c, I'm not Anubis. It's me, Carter.
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Three minutes 'til self-destruct.
CARTER
Teal'c, please.
[Teal'c looks at Carter, then lowers the zat.]
TEAL'C
Very well.
[Carter moves to sit at a keyboard and starts typing. The self-destruct
is aborted at two minutes, 24 seconds.]
VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
Self-destruct aborted. Self-destruct aborted.
[Carter closes her eyes in relief, then turns to look up at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Well done.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Vaselov is staggering down the corridor.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[A monitor shows that a remote dialing sequence has begun and is
counting down from five seconds.]
CARTER
Someone's activated the Gate.
[The first chevron begins locking.]
INT--SGC SECURE COMPUTER ROOM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Teal'c, this is Daniel. I think Anubis is headed for the Gate room.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Understood.
CARTER
I'll see if I can override the dialling sequence.
[O'Neill enters the Gate room and stands at the base of the ramp.]
TEAL'C
(quietly)
O'Neill.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[O'Neill is watching the Gate open.Suddenly Vaselov runs at him,
tackling him to the ground. Vaselov gets hold of O'Neill's gun and aims
it at him.]
O'NEILL
(ominously)
Stand aside.
VASELOV
Niet.
[Vaselov is perspiring and is unsteady. O'Neill looks at him menacingly
as Teal'c and Carter look on from the control room.]
VASELOV
You need a body to go through the Gate. Take mine. Take mine or I'll
kill us both.
[Anubis' essence leaves O'Neill and enters Vaselov. O'Neill collapses.
Vaselov looks up at the control room then walks through the event
horizon. The Gate shuts down as soon as Vaselov walks through.]
[The blast doors open and Carter and Teal'c enter the Gate room. Carter
runs up to O'Neill who is gaining consciousness.]
O'NEILL
Aargh!
CARTER
General!
O'NEILL
I'm okay. Ish.
[Carter and Teal'c, on each side of O'Neill, help him to sit up. They
all stare at the Stargate.]
O'NEILL
He got through, didn't he?
CARTER
Sort of.
[O'Neill looks at Carter.]
CARTER
I was able to override the established dialling sequence and input
an alternate address. I sent him to KS7-535 instead.
O'NEILL
Chilly.
[Carter nods.]
EXT--KS7-535
[Vaselov is kneeling in the snow, close to the Stargate. There is a
blizzard blowing. He is frozen to the ground.]
