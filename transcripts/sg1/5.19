TITLE
Menace
TEASER
EXT--OFFWORLD
[SG-1 approach a large, ruined building.]
CARTER
Looks like it was once an advanced civilisation, Sir.
DANIEL
No survivors.
O'NEILL
No bodies either.
DANIEL
Based on the overgrowth, I'm guessing this place was destroyed a
long time ago.
INT OF BUILDING
[From the interior of the building, Teal'c is seen opening the door.
SG-1 enter the building.]
CARTER
Faint energy readings definitely coming from here. Nothing dangerous
as far as I can tell.
INT OF BUILDING
[A female body is lying on a plinth, a thin cloth over her face.
O'Neill removes the cloth.]
DANIEL
She's perfectly preserved. This must be some sort of tomb or crypt
of some kind.
CARTER
Or a science lab.
DANIEL
Why would you say that?
CARTER
Because these energy readings I'm getting, seem to be coming from
her.
TITLES
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate is shown in the background, active but with the iris
closed. Hammond comes down the stairs to the control room.]
DAVIS
It's Colonel O'Neill, Sir.
[Hammond looks at the video transmission from the planet.]
O'NEILL
(on video link)
General?
HAMMOND
Colonel. What do you have to report?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Confirming initial MALP recon. Place is pretty much toast.
However, Carter did find something.
HAMMOND
Care to expand on that?
O'NEILL
She thinks it's a robot, Sir.
CARTER
Sir? I'm positive this is some sort of artificial life form but I
can't be sure of anything more than that under these conditions.
Request permission to bring it back to the SGC for further
evaluation, Sir.
HAMMOND
Can you assure me that will be safe?
CARTER
Well it appears to be inactive at the moment Sir, I'm getting only
very faint energy readings. I believe we could isolate it safely and
I definitely think this is worth examining.
DANIEL
It also may be the last remnants of a civilisation and the key to
finding out exactly what happened here Sir.
HAMMOND
Very well. Bring it through.
DANIEL
Thank you.
CARTER
Thank you.
O'NEILL
Out, Sir.
INT--A LAB IN THE SGC
[Carter is looking intently at the body. Janet enters.]
CARTER
Hey, Janet.
FRAISER
Hey. How's the new toy?
CARTER
Amazing. This is more advanced than any android we've encountered
before. Check this out.
[Carter and Janet move to a microscope. Janet looks into it, seeing a
green display.]
FRAISER
That some sort of nanotechnology?
CARTER
They seem to be some sort of self-repair mechanism.
FRAISER
But they're inactive.
CARTER
They seem to deactivate when disconnected from it. Her.
[Carter goes back over to the woman.]
CARTER
According to the ultrasonic scan, the power system is centred here.
(Carter indicates the side of the woman's head.)
There seems to be some sort of mechanism to access it from the
outside. I was just about to try to...
[Carter touches the robot's neck. A CD tray slides out.]
FRAISER
Wow.
INT. STAIRS TO BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill follows Daniel up the stairs to the briefing room.]
DANIEL
The Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Chinese, they all envisioned
synthetic beings that took on their shape and behaviour long before
the words robot or android were ever uttered.
O'NEILL
Yeah, so?
DANIEL
So, even in Earth's earliest civilisations, it's been our nature to
seek immortality through the creation of vessels for our
consciousness.
O'NEILL
Vessels?
[They arrive in the briefing room. Carter is already there, with
Hammond.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson. Major Carter and I were just discussing
whether or not to activate the robot.
DANIEL
You can?
CARTER
I think I found a way to recharge the unit's main power cell. Now
prior to this, it's been operating on less than one percent
capacity. I'm hoping that that was enough to maintain the memory
systems. Assuming it had any to begin with, of course.
O'NEILL
Of course. Why do you want to do this again?
CARTER
Well Sir, this is an incredibly advanced piece of technology. Given
enough time, eventually I might be able to figure out how some of
its functions work. The neurological systems seems to be as complex
as a human brain.
O'NEILL
So?
CARTER
So, I'm hoping that the robot will be able to help me understand
itself. Sir.
INT. SGC LAB
[Carter inserts a disc into the robot's CD tray. The tray closes but
nothing happens.]
O'NEILL
Now what?
CARTER
I don't know. The power cell should be fully charged. As far as I
can tell there isn't an on switch. It's possible the power was
depleted for too long.
O'NEILL
(To Daniel)
Why don't you kiss her?
[The robot takes a deep breath.]
CARTER
There's a pulse.
DANIEL
It has a heartbeat?
O'NEILL
It has a heart?
CARTER
It's designed to create a very realistic illusion of humanity.
[The robot takes another breath and sits up.]
REECE
Where am I?
DANIEL
You're in a special facility on the planet Earth. My name is Daniel
Jackson. This is Major Samantha Carter, this is Jack O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Hi.
REECE
My name is Reece. Where's my father?
DANIEL
We're not sure. Uh, please let me explain.
REECE
Don't hurt me.
DANIEL
No one wants to hurt you.
REECE
How did I get here?
DANIEL
Um, we found you on your planet. We brought you through the
Stargate.
REECE
What is that?
CARTER
Well there was one on your planet. It's a device that can be used to
travel great distances through space.
DANIEL
We can tell you more about it later.
REECE
Why did you bring me here?
DANIEL
Well I suppose there's no easy way to tell you this but the
civilisation on your planet was destroyed.
REECE
How?
DANIEL
We don't know.
O'NEILL
We were sort of hoping you could tell us.
REECE
I er...I was asleep.
DANIEL
Yes, we found you that way.
REECE
What about my father?
DANIEL
Well as far as we could tell, you were the only survivor. You don't
know anything about what happened?
REECE
My father knew there was danger. He told me to go to sleep. He said
he would wake me when the danger went away.
DANIEL
We're very sorry.
REECE
What do you want?
DANIEL
Well, we want to understand.
REECE
What?
DANIEL
Your planet and its history, and...
CARTER
You.
REECE
What about me?
CARTER
Well I'd really like to know more about how you work. Your systems,
how they function.
REECE
I'm like you.
CARTER
Ah, not exactly. At least as far as I can tell.
REECE
How are we different?
DANIEL
Sam, can I have a word?
CARTER
Yeah.
DANIEL
We're just going to step outside for a minute. Will you be okay?
We'll be right back.
[Carter and Daniel walk into the corridor outside the room. Reece looks
at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Excuse me.
[O'Neill leaves the room and joins Carter and Daniel in the corridor.]
DANIEL
I don't think she knows she's a robot.
O'NEILL
Okay, how is that possible?
DANIEL
Well the last time your consciousness was copied into a robot, you
didn't figure it out right away.
CARTER
Okay what are you suggesting?
DANIEL
I'm just saying that maybe we should avoid slapping her in the face
with the reality of her existence just moments after telling her,
her planet was destroyed.
O'NEILL
Why? It's a machine.
DANIEL
She just found out her father's dead.
O'NEILL
It's a machine.
CARTER
He's right. It's not like it ever had a real father.
DANIEL
Well maybe not. Maybe it's her creator. Or maybe we're talking to
the stored consciousness of a real human being who once did have a
real father. I think our past experience should be telling us to be
careful about deciding what is and what isn't a life form.
CARTER
Okay, I agree. All I'm saying is if she really doesn't know what she
is, she has a right to.
DANIEL
Okay, maybe we should wait a while. I mean, she did seem pretty
upset.
O'NEILL
For a machine.
DANIEL
We don't know what kind of psychological effect it will have.
CARTER
Psychological?
DANIEL
Whether her behaviour is a result of sophisticated programming or
not, I think the best way to find out about her and what she knows,
is by dealing with her on her own terms, at least for now.
O'NEILL
Couldn't hurt.
[Daniel returns to the room.]
CARTER
It doesn't make any sense.
O'NEILL
Which part?
CARTER
Why would somebody attack and destroy an entire civilisation and
leave one piece of incredibly advanced technology intact?
O'NEILL
Isn't that what he's trying to figure out?
CARTER
What I'm saying is, maybe there's something on the planet that we
missed.
O'NEILL
I'll go back.
INT--REECE'S ROOM
[Daniel is sitting in Reece's room, while she paces around, picking
things up. Carter watches from an observation window.]
REECE
Is the rest of your planet like this place?
DANIEL
No it's very different.
REECE
What's it like?
DANIEL
Well, there's lots of varying climates, different kind of
landscapes, big oceans, wide range of civilisations and each is home
to a lot if different kinds of people.
REECE
It sounds beautiful.
DANIEL
Much of it is.
REECE
Can I see it?
DANIEL
Soon.
REECE
Why not now?
DANIEL
Well, because we still have more to talk about, Reece.
REECE
I know, but we've been talking for so long now.
DANIEL
I know, but you must know a lot more than what we've already talked
about.
REECE
I do know a lot.
DANIEL
What can you tell me about the danger that came to your planet?
[She shakes her head, refusing to talk about that.]
INT--RUINED BUILDING ON PLANET
[On the planet, O'Neill and Teal'c enter the ruined building.]
O'NEILL
Well this might have turned out to be one colossal waste of time.
You boys find anything?
SG3 LEADER
Just lots of debris.
O'NEILL
I think our work is done here.
SG3 LEADER
Colonel, you said to look for anything uncharacteristic of the
indigenous technology, right?
O'NEILL
I would never say anything like that, Major.
SG3 LEADER
Right. Well, Major Carter said not to ignore anything however
insignificant it may seem.
O'NEILL
What have you got?
SG3 LEADER
Well I'm sure it's nothing, Sir, but we found a bunch of these
scattered around. I've never seen anything like them before.
[He hands O'Neill a container, from which O'Neill takes out a piece of
a replicator.]
SG3 LEADER
You know what they are?
O'NEILL
Oh yeah.
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter is studying the piece of replicator.]
CARTER
No energy readings. I'd say these blocks are dead. Probably been on
the planet since it was destroyed.
HAMMOND
Replicators were the cause of the destruction?
TEAL'C
The first evidence of the replicators in this galaxy.
DANIEL
It must have been a long time ago.
CARTER
Something still doesn't fit. The replicators we know go after
advanced technology, why would they eat everything on the planet and
leave Reece alone?
TEAL'C
Perhaps she has some means of defending herself against the
replicators.
DANIEL
She was asleep.
CARTER
It's possible that she's giving off some kind of signal or frequency
that repels them, maybe not even by design but by coincidence.
O'NEILL
Bug spray?
TEAL'C
If that is the case, then Reece herself may be the key to helping us
and the Asgard in our fight against the replicators.
CARTER
Yeah, maybe, but we're still a long way from determining that.
HAMMOND
Dr Jackson, what have you learned?
DANIEL
Well actually not much, Sir. She's kind of hard to pin down in a
conversation, her attention wanders. It's like she has the mind of a
child.
[Behind Daniel, O'Neill is seen playing with a magnifying glass and
pulling faces. The others look at him.]
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
I'm not sure, but she may not be telling me everything she knows
about what happened.
HAMMOND
You think she's deliberately hiding something?
DANIEL
I get that feeling.
HAMMOND
Why would someone create a robot with the mind of a child?
CARTER
Well, like Daniel suggested, it could be a transferred
consciousness, or it could be that the creator intended for her to
be emotionally mature but just couldn't get the programming right.
HAMMOND
If Dr Jackson is right, and she is hiding something, we should
proceed very carefully with any further interactions.
CARTER
Sir, I think it's time that we told Reece the truth. Daniel, maybe
if she's forced to confront the fact that she's an artificial life
form, it could change any pre-programmed priorities that she's
adhering to.
INT--REECE'S OBSERVATION ROOM
[Daniel enters.]
REECE
I'm so happy you're here.
DANIEL
What's that?
[Reece holds a small sculpture of two people intertwined.]
REECE
Oh, I made it. Do you like it?
DANIEL
It's very nice. How did you make this?
REECE
I'm so tired of this room, Daniel. Can I please go outside?
DANIEL
Um, sit down for a minute, Reece. We need to talk.
[Carter and O'Neill enter the observation room and sit down. Reece
looks up and sees them.]
REECE
No.
DANIEL
Look this is just going to take a minute, so just please sit down.
REECE
No, I don't want to talk any more Daniel, I want to have fun. Don't
you ever have fun?
DANIEL
Not as much as I would like to. Would you please sit down, this is
very important. Sit.
REECE
Then can we have some fun?
DANIEL
Yes.
REECE
Promise?
DANIEL
Yes. Okay, Reece, you know that there are different kinds of people,
right?
REECE
Yes.
DANIEL
In fact there are many different kinds of life forms.
REECE
This is boring.
O'NEILL
(To Carter, in the Observation Lab)
I'm starting to identify with this girl more and more.
DANIEL
Reece, I know you think we're the same but we're not.
REECE
My father always said I was special.
DANIEL
You are. You are very special. But despite the fact that you and I
look very much the same, we're very different.
REECE
That's obvious.
DANIEL
I mean on the inside.
REECE
How?
DANIEL
Well, I'm flesh and blood. You are a machine. A very, very
sophisticated machine, more of a computer really.
REECE
I'm alive.
DANIEL
Yes you are. Just not like me. Even though you were created to be
very human like, you are not human.
REECE
Yes, I am.
DANIEL
(standing up)
No you're not, Reece. Okay, I can prove that to you.
[Reece turns and pushes Daniel violently into a bookcase on the far
side of the room. She then bangs on the glass of the observation
window.]
REECE
I wanna leave here! Let me out! Let me out! Now!
INT--A CORRIDOR IN THE SGC
[O'Neill comes round the corner as Janet is tending to Daniel's head
injury.]
O'NEILL
Hey. That went well.
CARTER
Maybe she has some sort of programming that prevents her from
acknowledging she's anything but human.
O'NEILL
Robot denial?
DANIEL
Looks that way.
O'NEILL
Has it occurred to anyone that this thing may have been lying around
that planet for, oh, quite some time and that maybe it's broken? Or
perhaps it never worked right in the first place?
CARTER
So you think we should just shut her down?
O'NEILL
Oh, I don't know, let's ask the man who just had his head cracked
open.
DANIEL
I don't think she meant to hurt me. I just don't think she liked
what I was saying.
O'NEILL
I don't like most of what you say. I try to resist the urge to shove
you through a wall.
CARTER
Somehow Reece managed to survive a massive attack from replicators.
There has to be more that we can learn from her, Sir.
INT--REECE'S OBSERVATION ROOM
[Daniel enters.]
REECE
Finally!
[She hugs Daniel.]
REECE
Do you forgive me? You know I didn't mean to hurt you, right?
DANIEL
I know.
REECE
Good. I forgive you too.
DANIEL
Wh--wh--wh- what?
REECE
For attacking me.
DANIEL
I didn't attack you Reece.
REECE
It doesn't matter. Let's forget it.
DANIEL
No. No, I think we should talk about this.
REECE
No, please Daniel, I'm so bored. I just wanna get out of here. I
wanna see your world. Why are you all so afraid of me?
DANIEL
No one's afraid of you.
REECE
I won't do anything bad, I promise.
DANIEL
I know.
REECE
I made you something.
DANIEL
Yeah?
REECE
Remember when you said you wished that you could have more fun?
DANIEL
Yeah.
[A replicator crawls over the toys on a shelf and perches on Reece's
forearm.]
REECE
Don't be afraid. It's just a toy.
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[The replicator is in a glass case. O'Neill is tapping on the glass.]
CARTER
Sir, that glass is supposed to be acid resistant but it hasn't been
tested against replicator spray.
[O'Neill stops tapping the glass.]
O'NEILL
Why are we keeping this thing anyway? We know what they can do.
CARTER
She made it. She can control it.
DANIEL
Yes, but how did she make it?
CARTER
Well I think I have a pretty good idea.
[Carter brings up CCTV of Reece in the observation room. She holds a
pair of scissors, closes her hand over them, and they morph into a
piece of replicator.]
CARTER
Nanotechnology. The nanobots that she uses for self-repair are
apparently able to reorder matter on a microscopic level. She
understands their construction completely. She should know how to
defeat them.
HAMMOND
Will she tell us?
DANIEL
Well that's the problem.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
She's not talking.
O'NEILL
We make her talk.
DANIEL
I think she was offended because I didn't appreciate her present
very much.
CARTER
But this is so far beyond my understanding. I recommend that we
contact the Asgard. Maybe they can help.
HAMMOND
Agreed. I'll send SG-2 to try and make contact. In the meantime see
what else you can learn.
INT--REECE'S OBSERVATION ROOM
[Daniel and O'Neill enter. Carter and Teal'c are watching on monitors.]
DANIEL
Reece, we need to talk.
O'NEILL
Tell us what you know about the replicators.
REECE
Replicators?
O'NEILL
It's what we call them because that's what they do.
REECE
It's just a toy. It won't hurt you.
O'NEILL
A toy? There are millions of those things floating around in space
destroying everything they touch.
REECE
I don't know what you mean.
O'NEILL
They destroyed your planet and please, don't tell me you don't
remember because I think you do.
REECE
No! You want to destroy me!
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[The replicator moves. Teal'c points his P-90 at it.]
CARTER
Easy.
INT--REECE'S OBSERVATION ROOM
DANIEL
No one wants to hurt you.
O'NEILL
Just tell us what happened.
REECE
It wasn't my fault.
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[The replicator quietens down and stops moving.]
[Reece's voice comes over the video feed.]
REECE
(heard over monitor)
The people on my planet were afraid. They wanted to destroy my toys.
They wanted to destroy me.
INT--REECE'S ROOM
REECE
They said my father made me wrong, they thought that I was bad.
DANIEL
What did you do?
REECE
I taught my toys to make more of themselves. And I taught them to
defend themselves and me. In case anyone ever tried to destroy us.
O'NEILL
Well you taught them well.
DANIEL
When your toys started to attack your world, why didn't you stop
them?
REECE
I tried but I couldn't. They wouldn't listen to me any more.
DANIEL
Why did you go to sleep?
REECE
They killed everyone, they killed my father. Then they went away. I
was alone, I was sad. You don't like me any more. You think I'm bad.
O'NEILL
Actually, we want you to help us.
DANIEL
Reece, the replicators have become a problem for a lot of different
worlds. We need to know how to stop them.
REECE
You want to destroy them!
O'NEILL
Yes.
DANIEL
They're bad. They have to be stopped.
REECE
You want to destroy me!
DANIEL
No.
REECE
Yes, you do. You think that my father made me wrong, you hate me.
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[The replicator lunges suddenly towards the glass and it cracks. The
replicator sprays the glass and then jumps through. Teal'c shoots it.]
INT--REECE'S ROOM
[Reece looks distressed.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill and Daniel enter as Hammond enters from his office.]
HAMMOND
SG-2 has been unable to contact the Asgard through the Katal hall of
wisdom.
O'NEILL
Nothing?
CARTER
I hope they're okay.
HAMMOND
It would be unfortunate if the Asgard lost their battle with the
replicators at the time when we may have the key to stopping them in
our midst.
O'NEILL
Oh, I wouldn't count the little fellas out just yet, Sir.
CARTER
Sir, this robot is far beyond our understanding. We may be able to
use our weapons to fight the replicators, but without the Asgards'
help, I don't think we're going to be able to figure out how to use
Reece to defeat them on a grand scale.
HAMMOND
The robot's unwilling to co-operate?
O'NEILL
Completely clammed up, Sir.
DANIEL
She thinks we don't like her. Apparently her impression is that the
people of her world thought she was poorly constructed and wanted
her and her toys eliminated.
O'NEILL
Which would make them far smarter than we are.
CARTER
It seems whoever made Reece made a critical error. Made her smart
enough to build the replicators and yet emotionally immature.
DANIEL
She's just trying to defend herself. She really is just a kid who
unwittingly taught her toys to become a weapon of destruction.
O'NEILL
Maybe. She's been lying to us from the start.
HAMMOND
Major, it sounds to me like we're over our heads here. Until we
successfully contact the Asgard, I'm ordering you to shut the robot
down.
O'NEILL
Well, that's not going to be pretty.
HAMMOND
Do whatever's necessary.
INT--REECE'S ROOM
[Reece looks up at the security cameras.]
INT--SECURITY ROOM
[The security monitors go on the fritz. The SF picks up the phone.]
SF#1
The cameras in Isolation Room 1 are offline and I can't seem to get
them back.
INT--THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE REECE'S ROOM
SF#2
We got it.
(To the other SF)
Cameras are down.
[He swipes a security card into the door mechanism, but it doesn't
open. The second SF goes up the stairs.]
SF#3
They're in here.
[Replicators are crawling down the walls.]
INT--REECE'S ROOM
[She is sitting on the bed. In the background the shouts of the SFs can
be heard.]
SF#2
Behind you!
[The sound of gunfire is heard.]
SF#2
Get somebody down here now! Hurry! Now!
INT--REECE'S ROOM
[Reece is sitting quietly on the bed.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[SG-1 come out of an elevator. As an alarm sounds, they start to run.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE REECE'S ROOM
[One of the SFs is on the floor having been attacked by a replicator.]
SF#2
He's still alive. The medical team's on the way.
DANIEL
Where is she?
SF#2
The door was open and the prisoner was gone when I arrived, Sir.
CARTER
Replicators.
O'NEILL
(Into wall-phone)
O'Neill for Hammond. Yes Sir, we may have a replicator situation
down here. I suggest sealing the base and doing a clean sweep. Yes
Sir. And we also have a robot on the loose.
CARTER
Sir, we have to preserve her in one piece.
O'NEILL
And we'd like it in one piece, if possible. Yes Sir.
[O'Neill hangs up the phone.]
O'NEILL
Right, how'd this happen?
TEAL'C
The room has been cleared of any substance that may have been used
to create another replicator.
CARTER
She must have made enough blocks for two of them the first time that
would create more. There could be hundreds by now.
INT--IN THE SGC CORRIDORS
[SFs are being mobilised to tackle the replicators. O'Neill and a
number of SFs walk steathily along a corridor.]
INT--IN ANOTHER AREA
[Teal'c and other SFs move down a corridor. The lights suddenly go
out.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Hammond enter the control room. Carter sits down at a
computer terminal.]
CARTER
They've already breached the power systems Sir. Initiating computer
lockdown.
HAMMOND
Is this really going to stop any replicators from accessing the
dialling computer?
CARTER
I doubt it, Sir, but it might buy us a little time.
[The computer screen goes off.]
SF#1
(On radio)
Major Carter, security has been breached on level 28. Replicators
have been spotted heading towards the control room.
CARTER
Roger that.
[A replicator drops onto the computer.]
CARTER
Suggest retreating until backup arrives, Sir.
[From the Control Room window, the Gate room door is seen sliding open.
Reece enters, surrounded by replicators. She looks up as the Control
Room blast doors start to come down.]
CARTER
Sir!
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill moves along the corridor, followed by a number of SFs. They
meet up with Carter, Hammond and Daniel.]
CARTER
She's sealed herself in the Gate room. She's got a lot of
replicators with her.
DANIEL
She's probably trying to go home.
O'NEILL
Let's let her.
CARTER
Sir, we can't just let her leave.
O'NEILL
We'll tell the Asgard where she is.
DANIEL
Well I'm only guessing she's trying to go home. I mean, if she
thinks we're trying to destroy her, she could be going anywhere.
CARTER
We can't just let her leave with the replicators. She lost control
of them once, it could happen again.
O'NEILL
So we'll toss a nuke in behind her.
DANIEL
I'd like to try and stop her first.
O'NEILL
How?
DANIEL
Maybe, get her trust back.
O'NEILL
Then what?
DANIEL
Then, then, then I don't know. I'm just making this up as I go.
CARTER
If you could somehow manage to get close enough to her, you might be
able to remove her power chip.
TEAL'C
What of the replicators?
CARTER
These aren't the same replicators that we're used to dealing with.
Right now, she's controlling them. If Daniel can shut her down, the
replicators might just cease to operate. Look, they exist to protect
Reece. If she's eliminated, they have no protocol upon which to act.
TEAL'C
They may attack Daniel Jackson in order to exact revenge and to
restore their leader to power.
DANIEL
Yeah, well that's where you guys will come in.
HAMMOND
I'm willing to give you a chance, Dr Jackson.
O'NEILL
General, with all due respect, I think it's a bad idea.
HAMMOND
I hope not, Colonel.
INT--GATE ROOM
[Reece is standing on the ramp. The replicators are running around. The
lights come on again. Daniel moves towards the Gate room door.]
DANIEL
(Seen through the security camera)
Reece, please let me in, I just want to talk to you.
[The door opens and Daniel enters. The door closes behind him.]
REECE
Activate the Stargate.
DANIEL
No. No, I don't want you to go.
REECE
You hate me.
DANIEL
No I don't. No one does.
REECE
They're afraid of me.
DANIEL
They don't understand you, Reece.
REECE
I never meant to hurt anyone.
DANIEL
I know. Please stay.
REECE
It's too late now. I've accessed your computer system. I'll figure
it out for myself.
DANIEL
Reece. I don't want you to go.
REECE
Why not?
DANIEL
I want to be your friend.
REECE
I never had a friend.
DANIEL
I'll be your friend. Your toys may be a lot of fun but they're not
human like us.
REECE
They protect me.
DANIEL
I'll protect you.
REECE
Do you promise?
DANIEL
I promise. No one will hurt you. Come on.
(Daniel holds his hand out to Reece.)
Show you my world?
REECE
Really?
DANIEL
Yeah.
[As she approaches, Daniel tries to reach the power pack at the side of
her neck. Reece grabs Daniel's wrist and twists it, causing him to cry
out in pain, before collapsing on the floor.]
REECE
You are trying to disable me.
DANIEL
No.
REECE
Yes. You are lying. Lying is bad.
[She runs back up the ramp.]
REECE
None of you will ever hurt me!
INT--SGC SECURITY CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is monitoring what is happening in the Gate room. All the
cameras suddenly go off.]
CARTER
Sir, Daniel's in trouble. Replicators have evacuated the Gate room.
We're not sure where they went. All the cameras are down.
O'NEILL
Yeah, roger that. We're going in.
[An SF starts cutting through the Gate room door with an oxyacetelene
torch.]
INT--SGC SECURITY CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
Major, I won't let the replicators escape this base. We have to set
the self destruct.
CARTER
Replicators have taken over the main computer Sir. We'll have to cut
the system access and set the device locally.
[Carter and Hammond leave the security control room.]
INT--THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATE ROOM
[An SF is still working on cutting open the Gate room door.]
INT--GATE ROOM
DANIEL
(kneeling on the floor, holding his left wrist)
Reece, please listen to me.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Teal'c, O'Neill and a number of SFs are seen shooting replicators as
they swarm into the corridor.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Reece grabs her head.]
REECE
No! Make them stop!
INT--CORRIDOR B5
HAMMOND
On three count. Three, two, one.
[Carter and Hammond swipe their cards through the mechanism. The door
opens.]
HAMMOND
Clear.
[They go through the door, which closes behind them.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATE ROOM
[Teal'c and a number of SFs are shooting replicators.]
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
CARTER
(On radio to O'Neill)
Sir, we're getting ready to set the self destruct.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(Over radio)
I can't hear you!
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
[Carter inserts a key and types something into the computer.]
HAMMOND
On my mark. Three, two, one, turn.
[Carter and Hammond turn their keys. The self-destruct countdown is
seen as being set for five minutes.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Sir, we've set the self destruct. You have less than five minutes to
tell us to override. Do you copy?
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
Roger that.
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
[A replicator appears and Hammond shoots it as Carter ducks.]
CARTER
Thank you.
[Another replicator appears.]
CARTER
Sir!
[Carter shoots the replicator.]
INT--GATE ROOM
REECE
Make them stop!
DANIEL
I can't. You can.
REECE
No! You'll kill me.
DANIEL
No, no-one wants that. We just don't want you to destroy our world
the way you destroyed yours.
REECE
I didn't do it!
DANIEL
Yes, you did. You created the replicators, you told them to
replicate at all costs. They destroyed your world and you let them.
REECE
It wasn't my fault!
DANIEL
You could have stopped them before there were too many. You could
stop them now before you lose control.
REECE
No!
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
HAMMOND
Cease fire!
[A replicator is seen on a hole at the top of a door. It is moving
backwards and forwards.]
HAMMOND
What's it doing?
CARTER
I'm not sure, it's like it doesn't know what to do.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Teal'c and numerous SFs are still tackling the replicators.]
INT--GATE ROOM
DANIEL
Reece. Your father made you wrong!
REECE
No!
DANIEL
Yes! You destroyed your world.
REECE
(Sobbing)
I didn't mean to.
DANIEL
I know. But now you're going to destroy mine too.
REECE
I don't want to.
DANIEL
I know. That's why you have to stop now. No one will hurt you. We
may be able to fix you.
REECE
How?
DANIEL
Shut off your toys, go to sleep. We'll find a way.
REECE
I don't believe you.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Teal'c and the SFs continue shooting the replicators.]
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
[The countdown is at two minutes. The replicator at the top of the door
moves forward. Carter and Hammond shoot it.]
CARTER
(Into radio)
Colonel, I think Reece is losing control. At least one of the
replicators down here started to act on its own.
INT--GATE ROOM
DANIEL
I will wake you up myself, I promise. I'm your friend. I don't want
you to die.
REECE
I don't want you to die either.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Teal'c is surrounded by replicators.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill!
[The airman cuts a hole in the Gate room door. O'Neill runs in, takes
aim at Reece and shoots her. He turns and continues firing on the
replicators in the corridor. Daniel kneels by Reece as her eyes close.
Outside in the corridor, the replicators disintegrate.]
CARTER
(Over radio)
What's happening in there?
TEAL'C
(Over radio)
The replicators appear to have been disabled.
[O'Neill bends over Reece. He opens her power pack and takes out the
disc.]
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
The robot has been neutralised.
INT--MAIN COMPUTER ROOM
HAMMOND
Abort the self-destruct.
[Carter and Hammond take the keys out of the self-destruct system.]
INT--GATE ROOM
DANIEL
You stupid sonovabitch.
O'NEILL
Hey. You're welcome.
DANIEL
You didn't have to shoot her.
O'NEILL
Yes I did.
DANIEL
She was shutting them down.
O'NEILL
I had no way of knowing that and neither did you.
DANIEL
They didn't stop because you shot her. They stopped because she told
them to.
O'NEILL
Carter said she was losing control. Now if just one of those damn
things got out of this base, developed its own personality, we would
be royally screwed.
DANIEL
You just killed the only chance we'll ever have of stopping them.
O'NEILL
Look, I'm sorry. But this is the way it had to go down and you know
it.
O'NEILL
(Into radio)
All units, this is SG One Niner, commence sweep. I want every one of
those damn things out of here.
[He leaves the Gate room, leaving Daniel sitting on the floor beside
Reece.]
FADE OUT
