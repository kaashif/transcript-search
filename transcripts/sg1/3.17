TITLE
A Hundred Days
TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--EDORA (NIGHT)
[SG-1, along with a local woman, Laira, are sitting underneath the
stars, looking up at twin moons.]
O'NEILL
Laira, when's the big show start?
LAIRA
Soon. Be patient.
O'NEILL
Oh, I'm patient. I'm nothing if not patient. When's it start?
LAIRA
(to the others)
Is he always like this?
TEAL'C
Quite frequently.
O'NEILL
Thank you Teal'c.
DANIEL
Laira, we haven't seen anything you could call fire rain these past
few nights. How come you're sure it's gonna fall tonight?
LAIRA
It begins this night each year.
CARTER
Whoa. The same night every year? That doesn't make sense. I mean,
unless the planet's orbit travels through a debris field like an
asteroid belt, in which case...
O'NEILL
Please. Don't suck the fun out of this.
CARTER
Sorry, Sir.
LAIRA
When I was a child, my father told me that the fire rain was the
tears of our ancestors, longing to be reunited.
[A meteor shoots across the sky.]
DANIEL
A falling star. That's uh, that's what we call fire rain where we
come from. In our culture, you're supposed to make a wish.
TEAL'C
On Chulak, we call it tal'pak'rye.
DANIEL
Which means, uh...falling star.
LAIRA
What do you think, Jack? Was it worth the effort?
O'NEILL
Oh yeah. I'm a huge fan of fireworks.
[Dozens more meteors start to streak across the night sky. One enters
the atmosphere and burns up, while SG-1 watches in concern.]
O'NEILL
Carter? How close was that?
CARTER
Close, Sir.
DANIEL
How big?
CARTER
Big.
DANIEL
Thought so.
CARTER
I was...rather concerned for a minute there, Sir.
LAIRA
I don't understand.
CARTER
Laira, that's what we call a near miss. If that meteor had struck
the ground instead of bouncing off the atmosphere...
O'NEILL
(to Laira)
This...is an annual event?
LAIRA
Yes. Though it grows more spectacular every year. By tomorrow
evening, the entire sky...
[She stops when she sees their worried looks.]
LAIRA
(cont'd)
What's wrong?
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
I'll make some more observations tonight, Sir.
DANIEL
I'm gonna check the...geological record in the morning.
O'NEILL
I'll...make a wish.
[Meteors continue to shoot across the sky.]
END OF TEASER
EXT--VILLAGE, EDORA (DAY)
[The local villagers are going about their lives as normal.]
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA
[Carter has her laptop out and is explaining the astrological images on
the screen to Laira.]
CARTER
See this bright dot? It represents your world, Edora. Now it orbits
your sun in a big circle like this and crosses through an asteroid
belt up here at its widest point. Now as you pass through the
millions of tiny rocks and particles, some of them burn up in
Edora's atmosphere.
LAIRA
As fire rain.
CARTER
Exactly. The problem is, the asteroid belt isn't uniform. So certain
orbits in certain years must pass through a denser debris field. Can
you ever remember the fire rain striking the ground?
LAIRA
Not in my lifetime. Nor in my father's. But there is a tale of the
ancestors, that on the second day of the fire rain, there was a
distant thunder, and the horizon burned as though the sun never set.
CARTER
How long ago was that?
LAIRA
Many, many years ago.
[O'Neill enters the house.]
O'NEILL
Morning, campers. Who's going on Daniel's little geology field trip?
LAIRA
Garren?
[A young man comes out of a room.]
LAIRA
(cont'd)
Garren can show you the way to the caves. He and a young girl go
there from time to time, though I don't know why.
GARREN
(embarrassed)
Mother.
LAIRA
Fair day and be well.
[Garren leaves.]
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Sir, I'd like to go back to Earth and input the data I collected
from last night's observations into the base's mainframe.
O'NEILL
Go ahead.
CARTER
Fair day, Laira.
LAIRA
Fair day.
[Carter gathers her things and leaves.]
LAIRA
(to O'Neill)
I'm sure you want to discuss the treaty. Between our two worlds.
O'NEILL
Sure. We could do that.
INT--CAVES, EDORA
[Daniel is shaking a vial containing samples of rock, while Garren and
a young woman watch.]
DANIEL
I figure the decay rate differential between the naquada is about a
hundred and fifty years, give or take, so...
GARREN
What's naquada?
TEAL'C
A mineral substance.
DANIEL
You see, the further down these striations we go the further back
into Edora's past we travel.
[He runs his hand down the rock face.]
DANIEL
(cont'd)
See, these layers are different. They represent naquada dust thrown
up by impact events.
GARREN
Cool. Uh, J-Jack says that.
DANIEL
Yes he does. I'm not really sure that uh, cool, applies to this. You
see, something like this happened on my world millions of years ago
and nearly wiped out all life.
YOUNG WOMAN
That's what's going to happen here?
DANIEL
Well, we only know that it has happened, in varying degrees of
destruction every hundred and fifty years or so.
TEAL'C
And it appears that is precisely the amount of time since the last
impact. I see no reason to withhold the truth from these people,
Daniel Jackson.
GARREN
Is there anything we can do to stop it?
DANIEL
No.
[Garren and the young woman appear frightened.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC
[Carter is explaining the situation to General Hammond.]
CARTER
According to the observations I made last night, the near miss we
experienced was the just the first of hundreds of crash-sized
asteroids directly in the path of Edora...P5C 768. The night sky is
full of them.
HAMMOND
We can't evacuate an entire planet, Major.
CARTER
As far as we know, these are the only descendants of a people
brought to Edora by the Goa'uld thousands of years ago. There may
only be a small number of strikes locally. If that's the case, we
can send them home in a few days. If not, we'd be saving the last of
a people, Sir.
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill and Laira are out walking along the river. They cross a bridge
and meet a man fishing.]
LAIRA
Haynan. This is Jack.
HAYNAN
(to O'Neill)
They say you've come through the stone ring. Hard thing to ask a man
to believe.
O'NEILL
I know what you mean. Any luck?
HAYNAN
There is nothing more than meets the eye here. Our fields, those few
buildings...our children. What we have, we need.
O'NEILL
We're only interested in fair trade, Sir.
[Haynan doesn't appear convinced and continues to fish. O'Neill and
Laira move on.]
LAIRA
Many of my people are most curious to know what it is we have that
you could possibly want.
O'NEILL
Well, you remember how excited Carter got, the day we got here?
LAIRA
Something in our soil.
O'NEILL
That's a mineral called naquada. We don't have it on Earth. It's
very important to us.
LAIRA
Why?
O'NEILL
It's powerful.
LAIRA
And in return for taking this naquada from our soil?
O'NEILL
There are a lot of things we could help you out with. Medicine,
technology, education...we'd become friends.
LAIRA
We're already friends.
O'NEILL
Closer friends?
LAIRA
(laughing)
My mother taught me to be wary of men wishing to be closer friends.
O'NEILL
Well, if you'd like, I'll negotiate this treaty with your mother.
That way there'd be no conflict of interest...
[He is cut off as meteors start to shoot across the sky.]
LAIRA
I've never seen the fire rain in the light of day.
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Anybody else see that?
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, EDORA (DAY)
CARTER
(into her radio)
This is Carter, Sir. I did. I think it's just the beginning, Sir.
INT--CAVES, EDORA
[Daniel picks up some broken pottery and dusts it off.]
DANIEL
Look at this. It's a cooking utensil. Which probably means that at
some point, a number of people spent time here.
TEAL'C
Perhaps this cave provided a means for a small number of Edorans to
survive the last meteor bombardment.
GARREN
The ancestors.
O'NEILL
(over the radio)
Teal'c, Daniel. Back to the village, ASAP.
TEAL'C
Understood O'Neill.
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill is addressing the gathered villagers.]
O'NEILL
Folks, we think the fire rain is going to start hitting the ground
pretty soon. As a precaution, we'd like to take you all back to our
planet until the threat is over.
HAYNAN
There is no threat!
CARTER
If just one big meteor lands within a few miles of here, the
resulting explosion could wipe out the entire village.
HAYNAN
Year after year the fire rain comes, goes and harms no one. Do you
not see what they are doing? They want us gone, so they can claim
our lands for themselves.
DANIEL
That's not true.
HAYNAN
If you go with them, you will never see your land again.
O'NEILL
Oh for crying out loud...
(to Haynan)
There's always one like you in a crowd. You wanna stay? Stay.
LAIRA
(to the villagers)
I have come to know these travellers. And though their world seems
far, it is only a step away. I will take that step, in good faith.
If you wish to follow, join us at the stone ring. And if you do not,
may the ancestors protect you.
DANIEL
You need only take what you can carry. There'll be plenty of food
and water where we're going.
[A huge meteor shoots across the sky, leaving a burning trail and
strikes the mountain, making the ground shake.]
O'NEILL
All right, folks, train's leaving! Let's move!
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA
[Laira is quickly packing.]
LAIRA
Garren? Don't forget the prayer chain that your father gave you.
Garren?
[She receives no answer and runs into his room, which is empty.]
LAIRA
Oh no.
EXT--VILLAGE (DAY)
[Laira runs over to SG-1.]
LAIRA
Have you seen Garren?
O'NEILL
Daniel? Teal'c? Garren come back with you?
TEAL'C
He should be here, O'Neill.
DANIEL
The caves. We were talking about how previous generations survived.
They must have gone back there.
O'NEILL
All right, you three go. Get these people out of here. We'll find
the kids and catch up.
CARTER
Sir?
O'NEILL
Go!
[He runs off with Laira in search of Garren.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[The Stargate opens.]
SERGEANT
SG-1's code, Sir.
HAMMOND
Here they come, people.
(to Frasier)
Doctor, stand by to receive refugees.
FRASIER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill and Laira are running towards the caves.]
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, EDORA (DAY)
[Daniel is standing before the open Stargate, helping the villagers
through, while meteors continue to fall.]
DANIEL
(to villagers)
Don't be afraid, the others are waiting for you on the other side.
CARTER
(into her radio)
Sir, this is Carter. We've begun the evacuation, what's your ETA?
[There is no answer from O'Neill.]
CARTER
(cont'd)
Colonel! We're getting multiple strikes now! Please respond!
[There is still no answer.]
CARTER
(to Daniel)
Nothing.
[Teal'c helps an elderly couple towards the Stargate.]
TEAL'C
That is the last of them. The rest wish to remain behind.
CARTER
How many?
TEAL'C
Approximately one third of the village.
DANIEL
What?!
CARTER
(to Daniel)
You go through to let the Edorans know that everything's all right.
I'll be on your six.
[Daniel goes through the Stargate.]
CARTER
(into her radio)
Colonel! Please respond!
INT--CAVES, EDORA
[Garren and the young woman he was with are waiting inside the caves as
Laira and O'Neill enter.]
LAIRA
Garren! NAITHA!
GARREN
Mother! This is where the ancestors survived. We brought food and
some water and...
O'NEILL
Garren, try this my way.
[There is a impact above and the cave starts to shake.]
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, EDORA (DAY)
[Meteors are continuing to rain down.]
CARTER
It's getting too dangerous Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I will remain until O'Neill returns.
CARTER
He can dial home when he gets here.
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[Edoran villagers are making their way down the Stargate ramp, while
Daniel waits for the rest of SG-1.]
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, EDORA (DAY)
[A meteor heads straight for Carter and Teal'c's position, who run for
the Stargate and dive through.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[The wormhole starts to collapse.]
SERGEANT
We're losing wormhole stability.
[Carter and Teal'c tumble through just as the wormhole collapses.
Daniel and Hammond are waiting at the bottom of the ramp.]
CARTER
(to Hammond)
Colonel O'Neill went to help some villages. We waited until the last
possible moment, Sir.
HAMMOND
I know you did. We almost lost you.
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I wish to return immediately with a search party.
CARTER
You can't Teal'c. That last hit was right on top of the Gate, you'd
be walking into a fire storm.
TEAL'C
I am willing to take that risk.
HAMMOND
I'm not willing to let you.
CARTER
(to Hammond)
We wait twenty four hours, and send a MALP through, Sir.
HAMMOND
Major Carter's right. If it's safe by tomorrow, you'll all go.
EXT--EDORA (NIGHT)
[O'Neill is standing inside the entrance to the cave. Outside, it is
raining, but there are fires in the hills beyond.]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Carter? Teal'c?
[There is no answer and he turns around and heads back inside.]
INT--CAVES, EDORA
[O'Neill sits down by Laira and the two children.]
O'NEILL
It's still pretty hot out there. We should stay put. There's good
news. It's raining. Should put out some of the fires.
LAIRA
Could you see the village?
O'NEILL
No. Garren, we had a plan.
GARREN
Daniel said there's nothing you could do.
NAITHA
We were afraid.
O'NEILL
Me too.
[There is a loud noise from outside and Laira moves to sit closer to
O'Neill, holding onto him.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC
[The Stargate is in the process of dialling up.]
SERGEANT
Chevron 6 encoded...Chevron 7...lock.
[The Stargate opens up.]
SERGEANT
Wormhole established.
CARTER
Thank God.
SERGEANT
(to Hammond)
Standing by for MALP deployment, Sir.
HAMMOND
Send it through.
[A MALP moves up the ramp and enters the wormhole.]
SERGEANT
The MALP should reach Edora in four...three...two...one...We should
be receiving telemetry now, Sir.
[The video screen shows nothing but static, while SG-1, Hammond and
Frasier look on.]
SERGEANT
No signal
TECH #1
Environmental reports no telemetry.
TECH #2
Communications, no telemetry.
CARTER
Then the MALP must have been destroyed as soon as it reached the
other side. There's no other explanation.
HAMMOND
(to the sergeant)
Shut it down.
[The wormhole is closed.]
HAMMOND
Until you can provide me with answers to this problem, the rescue
mission is scrubbed.
(to Frasier)
Inform our visitors they'll be staying with us until we can make a
proper assessment of our situation.
FRASIER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--VILLAGE, EDORA (DAY)
[Smoke is rising from the village and the surrounding hills.]
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA
[O'Neill, Garren and Laira enter the house to find other villagers
inside. Laira sees Haynan, who seems to be in shock.]
LAIRA
>Haynan?
HAYNAN
Laira.
LAIRA
It is all right.
HAYNAN
One struck Telmar's home. Three families were inside. We are all
that are left.
LAIRA
Why did you stay?
HAYNAN
On the third day we could take no more. We fled to the stone
ring...where it used to be.
O'NEILL
Used to be?
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, EDORA, (DAY)
[O'Neill runs to the clearing, but there is nothing but a crater where
the Stargate used to stand. Laira comes over to him.]
LAIRA
It's gone. I'll never see my people again. They can never come home.
O'NEILL
Nope.
LAIRA
And you.
[He walks away from her and kicks at the rubble.]
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA (NIGHT)
[Laira brings food over to the table to feed the people sheltering in
her house.]
LAIRA
Thanks be to the ancestors that we live and have a roof to shield
our heads. Thanks be to the ancestors that we have food, to sustain
and nourish us.
[O'Neill enters the house.]
HAYNAN
(to O'Neill)
This is all that remains of our people...because of you.
NAITHA
My mother and father.
HAYNAN
He took them away through that thing and now it is gone.
O'NEILL
That thing probably saved their lives. And if you'd shut up and
listened to me in the first place, this wouldn't be the situation.
[O'Neill starts to leave.]
LAIRA
(to O'Neill)
This is my home and you are welcome here. You need to eat.
[He slowly takes a seat at the table.]
O'NEILL
(to Laira)
Thank you.
INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC
[SG-1 and Hammond are trying once more to contact Edora.]
SERGEANT
No signal from the radio transmitter, Sir.
TEAL'C
If the Edoran Stargate were truly buried, how then was the wormhole
established?
CARTER
The meteor hit while the wormhole was active.
DANIEL
So, so?
CARTER
So it's possible that the molten naquada hardened just above the
event horizon.
DANIEL
Like an iris.
CARTER
Yes.
HAMMOND
SERGEANT, shut it down.
SERGEANT
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
That was our last shot, people and I'm calling this one. As of right
now, I'm officially declaring him missing in action.
TEAL'C
General Hammond, perhaps Edora could be reached by another means.
DANIEL
That's right, the Tok'ra could send a ship.
CARTER
Or the Tollan.
DANIEL
Let me at least contact those of our allies that are capable of
interstellar travel and see if they're willing to help.
HAMMOND
Very well, Doctor.
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill is lying asleep on the floor when Laira enters, dressed in a
nightgown. She starts to wash from a bowl when O'Neill wakes up.]
LAIRA
I thought you might like a clean work shirt. My husband never wore
it. I made it for him just before he died.
O'NEILL
There's a chance the Stargate is just buried...
LAIRA
We have to rebuild before the harvest and there are very few of us
now.
[She holds out the shirt and he takes it.]
INT--DEBRIEFING ROOM, SGC
[Hammond is watching the Stargate.]
HAMMOND
Wormhole physics, a field, Major, that you pioneered, states that
under these conditions, ordinary matter won't even reintegrate on
the other side. There's no way to overcome that.
CARTER
I think there is, Sir. And I'm not the one who thought of it. Sokar
did.
HAMMOND
Sokar?
CARTER
Yes, Sir. When he tried to breach the iris by bombarding it with a
particle beam. Sub-atomic particles barely small enough to
reintegrate produced energy as they decayed.
HAMMOND
Which caused the iris to heat up.
CARTER
Exactly. Now, if we could do the same thing we could melt the
hardened naquada barrier just above the event horizon and create a
pocket of superheated gas.
HAMMOND
And then what?
CARTER
Well, then all we have to do is open the Gate again, Sir. The
unstable vortex it normally generates would then be allowed to
expand into that pocket and create an even larger cavern. One person
might be able to go through, Sir, and dig it out.
HAMMOND
I think we can safely assume Teal'c would volunteer, but...
CARTER
We don't have a particle beam generator, Sir. We'd have to build
one.
HAMMOND
Then you'd better get started.
[Carter leaves.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill is digging the ground around what used to be the Stargate
clearing, when Garren comes over.]
GARREN
You, uh, missed evening meal. I brought you some.
O'NEILL
I wasn't hungry.
GARREN
You gotta be. You've worked all day in the fields.
O'NEILL
I got a couple of hours of good light left.
GARREN
I'm sorry.
O'NEILL
For what?
GARREN
You can't go home. It's my fault.
O'NEILL
No it's not.
[He continues to dig, while Garren leaves.]
INT--CARTER'S LABORATORY, SGC
[Carter is working on her particle beam generator. Dr Frasier enters
with a cup of coffee for her.]
FRASIER
You working through the night again?
CARTER
Yeah. Lot of work to do. Thank you.
FRASIER
Look, SAM, there's no doubt you're going to solve this, but you have
to accept the fact it's going to take time.
CARTER
Yeah, well if I think that way, it could take months.
FRASIER
Daniel says the Tollan could have a ship in the vicinity of Edora
some time right next year.
CARTER
He shouldn't have to wait that long.
FRASIER
You miss him.
CARTER
Yeah.
FRASIER
Is this a problem?
CARTER
No. No, of course not.
FRASIER
Ok.
[Frasier leaves.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill is tossing stones into a pond. Laira approaches.]
LAIRA
Many of us fear the fire rain will come again. Do you?
O'NEILL
No. If Daniel was right, and he always is, it'd be another hundred
and fifty years before that happens again. It's a long time. I was
kinda wondering which direction home was.
[Laira gestures towards the village.]
LAIRA
This way.
O'NEILL
No, I meant...
LAIRA
I know what you meant. Come. I like your company.
O'NEILL
I don't even like my company right now.
LAIRA
You will again. Loss is that way. I mourned my husband for a hundred
days. I never left my house, I never spoke to anyone.
O'NEILL
After that?
LAIRA
I left my house and I spoke to people. Walk with me.
[He takes her hand and they walk away.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[Three months later...O'Neill is canoeing down the river. Laira walks
over to him and holds out his water bottle.]
LAIRA
You left this at home.
[He gets out of the boat.]
O'NEILL
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
[They start walking down a path.]
LAIRA
Haynan has invited you to evening supper.
O'NEILL
Why? He doesn't even like me.
LAIRA
He is very grateful for all the help you have given him in
rebuilding his home.
O'NEILL
I just hammered a few nails. Well, actually, I made the nails first
then I hammered them, but...
LAIRA
Still, you've worked very hard. Thank you.
O'NEILL
Anything I can do.
LAIRA
There is something.
[They stop walking.]
O'NEILL
Yeah? What?
LAIRA
No. It's too soon.
O'NEILL
No, come on, don't...do that. What?
LAIRA
You'll know when the time comes.
O'NEILL
I need a little help here. A hint.
[Laira leans forward and kisses him.]
LAIRA
Does that help?
O'NEILL
A little.
[They kiss again.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC
CARTER
Initiating sequence now.
[The particle generator Carter has built fires up and shoots a beam
into the Stargate's event horizon.]
CARTER
Particle beam is operating at a hundred and twelve percent of
predicated efficiency.
HAMMOND
How long will the beam have to be maintained?
CARTER
The longer the better, Sir. The important thing will be to dial
again as quickly as possible as soon as it shuts down.
INT--HAYNAN'S HOUSE, EDORA (NIGHT)
[A villager pours out a drink for O'Neill.]
HAYNAN
Well, what do you think?
O'NEILL
Absolute rot gut. More please.
[He is poured another. Laira and O'Neill sit together and watch the
villager's dancing. Garren is blindfolded and spun around. He finds his
way to NAITHA and removes the blindfold.]
O'NEILL
What just happened?
LAIRA
The ancestors guided him to the one they wish him betrothed.
O'NEILL
He was peeking!
[A villager drags O'Neill onto the floor.]
O'NEILL
What?
[He is blindfolded and spun around and he makes his way back to Laira.
He pulls her up into a hug and kisses her cheek.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[A MALP makes its way up the Gate ramp and disappears into the event
horizon.]
SERGEANT
MALP should be arriving at the Edora Gate in three...two...one.
Receiving telemetry.
[His computer screen goes blank.]
SERGEANT
No wait, wait. We've lost it. There's no signal.
HAMMOND
What's happening?
SERGEANT
Transmission interrupted the source.
CARTER
Play back the visual.
[The video shows the MALP's progress.]
CARTER
Whoa, there. See?
TEAL'C
The Gate is horizontal as you thought, Major Carter.
CARTER
And the MALP just slipped back through the event horizon. It means
the vortex would have dug partway to the surface. Teal'c, you'll
need to secure yourself above the event horizon as soon as you're on
the other side. And you'll have to carry everything you need.
TEAL'C
I understand.
HAMMOND
I hope you do, son. Because if you fail to dig your way to the
surface, this will be a one way trip.
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Laira and O'Neill enter the house.]
O'NEILL
Garren?
LAIRA
Just us.
O'NEILL
Well, apparently I should expect a massive headache tomorrow, so I
should...get a head start.
LAIRA
Do you remember when I told you there was something you could do for
me?
[O'Neill nods.]
LAIRA
I want you to give me a child.
O'NEILL
A child.
LAIRA
I wanted to be patient. I wanted to wait until you had let go of the
life you left behind. Until you knew that you belonged with us.
Tonight, there is something in your eyes.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Laira. You should know, a part of me is never going to let go of
what I left behind.
LAIRA
It's not the part I want.
[They kiss.]
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[Teal'c is preparing for his trip through the wormhole. The Stargate
opens, while Hammond watches from the Control Room.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[Haynan and O'Neill are chopping wood.]
HAYNAN
She is a fine woman.
O'NEILL
Yes she is.
HAYNAN
Took you long enough to see that. I was afraid you were going blind.
O'NEILL
No. If I've gone blind, it's from whatever we were drinking last
night.
[He swings his axe but fails to cut through the wood, obviously
suffering the effects of a hangover.]
HAYNAN
Has a bite to it.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[He tiredly stacks the wood, but it topples over.]
INT--UNDERGROUND, EDORA
[Teal'c has secured himself to the ceiling of the cave, the Stargate's
event horizon open just beneath him.]
TEAL'C
(into his radio)
General Hammond. I have secured myself on the other side.
HAMMOND
(over the radio)
Understood Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I will begin immediately.
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill is sharpening his axe on a grinder. Laira comes out of the
house carrying some of his belongings.]
O'NEILL
Going somewhere with that stuff?
LAIRA
I just thought you might not need these things anymore.
O'NEILL
Oh, hang on, some of that's pretty good. The jacket...it's...
LAIRA
Does it remind you of home?
[They stare at each other for a long moment.]
O'NEILL
Toss it.
LAIRA
Are you sure?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[Laira walks away with his things.]
INT--UNDERGROUND, EDORA
[Teal'c is hanging from the ceiling of the cave, continuing his attempt
to dig his way to the surface.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM, SGC
DANIEL
(over the radio)
What's your progress Teal'c?
TEAL'C
(over his radio)
It is most difficult Daniel Jackson.
CARTER
The Gate will shut down automatically in sixty seconds. At that
point, we won't be able to open it again from this side. The vortex
would vaporise everything within the cavern.
HAMMOND
(to Teal'c)
You'll have a maximum of fours hours of oxygen once we're cut off.
If you haven't reached the surface by that time...
TEAL'C
You may want to wish me rel'tor'key.
DANIEL
(understanding)
Good luck, Teal'c.
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[Laira is about to throw O'Neill's belongings into the pond. She picks
up his radio and examines it.]
CARTER'S VOICE
(over the radio)
Fifteen seconds till shutdown...Ten seconds till shutdown...Five
seconds.
INT--UNDERGROUND, EDORA
[Teal'c is still attempting to cut his way through to the surface.]
INT--LAIRA'S HOUSE, EDORA
[O'Neill and Laira are sitting together at the table.]
O'NEILL
Curling. Big where my grandfather's from in Northern Minnesota. You
throw a big, round kinda slab of rock down this slab of ice
and...sweep...What?
LAIRA
When I was taking your things away today, I thought I heard a sound
come from this. Perhaps a voice.
[She hands him his radio and, after a moment, he gets up and leaves the
house.]
EXT--EDORA (DAY)
[O'Neill and Garren are walking across what used to be the Stargate
clearing.]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
This is Colonel Jack O'Neill, come in.
TEAL'C
(over the radio)
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Teal'c! Where the hell are you?!
TEAL'C
Attempting to reach the surface. Little oxygen remains, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
I got your RDF signal. I'm right on top of you!
[O'Neill and Garren quickly start to dig. Laira comes over and O'Neill
pauses as they look at each other, then continues to dig.< He breaks
through into the cave below and sees Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c!
EXT--VILLAGE, EDORA (DAY)
[The Edorans are reuniting with their people, while SG-1 stand close
by.]
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
So when the third MALP sent back just a few seconds of telemetry, we
knew the Gate was hori...zontal.
[She is cut off as O'Neill brushes passed her.]
CARTER
Is he all right?
DANIEL
He's fine. I just don't think he was expecting to go home again.
[O'Neill stands before Laira and she takes his hands.]
LAIRA
You must be very happy to be going home.
O'NEILL
No, I'm not.
LAIRA
You don't have to.
O'NEILL
Come with me.
LAIRA
I belong here.
O'NEILL
I'll come back. Soon. We still have that treaty to talk about.
LAIRA
Of course. Our two worlds are going to be friends.
[They embrace sadly.]
LAIRA
Closer friends. Fair day and be well.
[O'Neill walks back to SG-1 while Laira stands and watches, her hands
crossed protectively over her stomach.]
FADE OUT
THE END
