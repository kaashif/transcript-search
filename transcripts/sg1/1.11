TEASER
FLASHBACK
INT--SGC GATE ROOM C. 1945
[Group of men--both military and scientist--are standing around the
Stargate. Two Army Air Corps soldiers are positioned on each side of
the 'gate and are turning the ring of the 'gate manually. An older man
directs their progress.]
LANGFORD
Now! Stop!
[Ernest looks at Langford and nods, then turns away from the 'gate to a
technician.]
ERNEST
Charge!
[The technician throws a couple of power switches simultaneously. A
chevron locks in place.]
LANGFORD
First lock engaged.
[Langford motions for the soldiers to continue to turn the 'gate.]
LANGFORD
Revolve.
[A soldier is filming the proceedings. The entire room and the scene's
color changes to a sepia tone, the film becomes grainy as it continues
to show different shots of the activity.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is watching a playback of the film on a television monitor. He
is staring at the television as O'Neill walks in.]
O'NEILL
You know, we're supposed to be at that physical assessment thing.
DANIEL
Oh, yeah. I'll...uh...I'll go. I'll go. I just...just...um...let me
finish this reel.
O'NEILL
You know, you seem a tad obsessed with this stuff.
[Daniel continues to stare at the TV.]
DANIEL
This was transferred from film of experiments done on the 'gate in
1945. You don't find that the least bit intriguing?
O'NEILL
Oh yeah! Nothing piques my interest more than repeated failure.
DANIEL
Look at them. They're turning the 'gate manually, for god's sake.
It's incredible.
O'NEILL
How many hours of this stuff have you looked at?
DANIEL
(frustrated, looking at O'Neill briefly)
There's no conclusion to the file. There's no summary; no notes. No
reason to explain why they gave up.
O'NEILL
Well, whole boxes of material could be missing.
DANIEL
No, the Pentagon said this was everything.
O'NEILL
Oh, please. The Pentagon's lost entire countries. Come on.
[Pats the side of Daniel's chair and then his shoulder and starts to
walk away.]
O'NEILL
Doctors have two days of tests planned for us. Wonderful tests!
[Daniel continues watching and the scene in the 'gate room shows the
Stargate activated and the event horizon shimmering as a lone person is
outfitted in an old-style deep diving suit.]
DANIEL
Ummm...Jack?
[O'Neill turns back and moves closer to the TV and watches the images
in shock just behind Daniel.]
O'NEILL
That's impossible.
DANIEL
Obviously, not. This doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't someone
have told us this? I mean, why would they stop their research if
they'd actually managed to turn it on?
[O'Neill and Daniel continue to watch the television as they see a
figure clad in the diving suit step through the event horizon. The
event horizon then disengages and the air hose and rope are severed on
the ground. One of the technicians or scientists picks up the tubing,
shocked, and the film ends abruptly as if broken.]
O'NEILL
(whispers)
Holy cow.
[O'Neill and Daniel are shocked.]

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--HOME OF CATHERINE LANGFORD
[The home is large and two-storied. A driver of a limousine shuts the
door as Catherine Langford strolls up the walkway.]
INT--FOYER OF LANGFORD'S HOUSE
[A domestic maid opens the door for Catherine.]
CATHERINE
Hello, Martha.
MARTHA
Miss Langford, there's a young man waiting for you in the kitchen.
CATHERINE
You let a strange young man into the house?
MARTHA
Yes. I'm sorry. He said he knows you.
INT--KITCHEN
[Catherine walks into her kitchen and stops short with a stunned and
delighted expression on her face.]
CATHERINE
My God!
[Daniel hurriedly returns an artifact back to its place on a shelf.]
DANIEL
(sheepishly)
Hello. Umm...I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind.
[Catherine and Daniel hug warmly. Catherine laughs.]
CATHERINE
How long have you been back? Oh. My God, why are you back? Colonel
O'Neill said you stayed on Abydos.
[Daniel notices her necklace in an attempt to not answer.]
DANIEL
I see you...you got the amulet.
CATHERINE
Yes, of course. I never take it off. Why avoid my question? What's
this all about?
[Daniel looks at her awkwardly.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Colonel O'Neill is poring through papers from file boxes labeled Top
Secret. General Hammond walks in.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, Dr. Jackson was supposed to be briefing SG-4 this
morning. He's not here and he's not answering our pages. Any idea
where he is?
O'NEILL
I haven't seen him in a while, sir.
[Hammond leaves the room while O'Neill continues to look at papers.]
INT--LANGFORD HOUSE
[Catherine strides angrily from the kitchen into her drawing room.
Daniel follows her placatingly.]
DANIEL
Catherine, I couldn't tell you.
CATHERINE
Why not?
DANIEL
They wouldn't let me. Everything is...is classified...You know.
CATHERINE
When did you become an upstanding member of the military?
[She angrily sets the teakettle on the tray with the teapot.]
DANIEL
I'm not...exactly. That's why I'm here.
CATHERINE
I'll make you some tea, then you can go back to your Stargate
Command...
Thousands of Stargates. Planetary shifts. Didn't anyone think that I
might be interested?
DANIEL
That's why I came.
CATHERINE
Now! Six months later. You could have told me sooner.
DANIEL
Yes. Just like you could have told me there were experiments done on
the 'gate in 1945.
[Catherine's expression softens. She walks over to sit on the piano
bench.]
CATHERINE
My father headed up a research team that worked on the 'gate during
the war. Actually, they didn't know what it was then. President
Roosevelt was like that--curious. They suspected the 'gate was a
weapon and could be used as one. Nothing ever came of it, though.
How do you know?
DANIEL
The Pentagon has recently been declassifying old materials. They ran
across a number of file boxes that dealt with the old experiments
and they sent them to us.
CATHERINE
Really?
DANIEL
You weren't involved in the research?
CATHERINE
The military had very little use for a 21-year-old girl at that
time. Neither did my father. I only know what little I overheard him
and Ernest talking about.
DANIEL
I'm sorry. Who's...Ernest?
[Catherine looks plaintively off to another part of the room, perhaps
at a picture.]
FLASHBACK
INT--LANGFORD HOME, 1945
[A young couple is seated in front of a fire in the fireplace.
Catherine is rubbing Ernest's shoulders as he sits up and faces her.]
ERNEST
We get as far as entering the fifth symbol and then the whole room
starts to shake. Today, one of the generators exploded from the
feedback.
CATHERINE
Are you going to talk to my father?
ERNEST
(oblivious)
Oh, he knows. He was there.
CATHERINE
I meant, about us.
ERNEST
(smiles)
Oh...yes, I will.
CATHERINE
Maybe it's supposed to do that.
ERNEST
What?
CATHERINE
The ring. Maybe it's supposed to shake.
ERNEST
(laughing)
I don't think so.
CATHERINE
Are you using alternating or direct current to charge it?
ERNEST
Alternating...I think. Why?
CATHERINE
Try using direct. It might prevent the charge from bouncing back to
the generator...And you should talk to my father.
ERNEST
(smiles)
I will. I promise.
[Ernest and Catherine kiss.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CATHERINE'S DRAWING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
[Catherine is preparing the tea.]
DANIEL
Sooo, you didn't know the government kept the files from the
original experiments.
CATHERINE
I had my father's notes. He told me that was everything they had. Do
you know how many administrations I had to petition to get this
program started up again? Forty years had passed. The information
was classified and buried. I never asked for any files, because I
thought I had them. General West never offered, because he probably
didn't know they existed.
DANIEL
(amazed, realizing)
So, you don't know that they turned the 'gate on in 1945.
[She turns to face Daniel, stunned.]
CATHERINE
What?
FLASHBACK
INT--LANGFORD DINING ROOM,1945
[Ernest and Catherine's father, Langford, are seated at the dining room
table.]
ERNEST
(excitedly)
There must be over a hundred million possible combinations. If it's
merely a combination lock used to turn it on, why 39 symbols? Why
not six?
LANGFORD
(irritably)
What are you saying?
ERNEST
They're not combinations. They're destinations, and we just found
one.
LANGFORD
A doorway to heaven can mean any number of different things. It
could simply mean that anyone who passes through there will die...
[Catherine walks in on the men carrying a tray with a teapot and cups.]
LANGFORD
...For example.
[Both men are disturbed by Catherine's intrusion on their conversation.
Catherine smiles at Ernest and he shyly returns the smile as she pours
the tea.]
LANGFORD
(tiredly)
Catherine, we have a maid for a reason.
CATHERINE
I wanted to do it.
[She appears to signal to him that he should talk to her father. She
eventually understands that she's not wanted and leaves the room. Her
father smiles exasperatedly after his daughter's exit and reaches for
the lumps of sugar.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CATHERINE'S DRAWING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
[Catherine drops a lump of sugar into her tea.]
CATHERINE
No. I never knew they turned it on. My father never told me. It
wasn't in his notes, either.
DANIEL
Then there's something more you should see.
[Some moments later he puts a videotape in the VCR and hits the remote
while Catherine puts her glasses on.]
DANIEL
Here, watch this.
[The TV playback shows scenes of Ernest putting on the diving suit and
standing in front of the activated Stargate. Ernest is smiling.]
CATHERINE
Oh, God.
[The tape finishes, showing the cut off of the gate. Catherine looks on
in shock.]
FLASHBACK
INT--LANGFORD DINING ROOM, 1945
[Catherine is standing behind a chair. Langford stands by the door.]
LANGFORD
There was an accident today. An explosion in the lab.
CATHERINE
Ernest?
LANGFORD
I'm so sorry.
[Catherine begins to cry.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CATHERINE'S DRAWING ROOM, PRESENT DAY
DANIEL
So the man who went through the 'gate is Ernest.
[Catherine pulls off her glasses wearily.]
CATHERINE
Yes. My father must have lied to me. He said Ernest died in an
accident. An explosion.
DANIEL
Why would he do that?
CATHERINE
He probably thought he was protecting me.
DANIEL
From what?
CATHERINE
From knowing that the man I was supposed to marry chose to risk his
life and go through the Stargate without even talking to be about
it. He chose his idea -- his work -- over me.
DANIEL
Um...I'm sure that he believed that he would...he would come back.
CATHERINE
He was so young, so full of passion. Like you. You reminded me of
him when I first saw you. That's why I knew you'd solve the
mysteries of the 'gate.
DANIEL
(suddenly realizing)
Catherine. I wasn't supposed to show you this.
[He pulls out large envelope with pictures from a file box.]
DANIEL
Actually, I wasn't supposed to show you any of this, but now...
[Hands her the pictures.]
DANIEL
Computer enhancements from the film footage.
[Catherine flips through the pictures.]
DANIEL
I was able to isolate the chevrons as they were locked in before
Ernest went through.
CATHERINE
Not Abydos?
DANIEL
No. Another planet with similar coordinates....And, we can go there.
[Catherine looks at him disbelievingly.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Voiceover of General Hammond shouting.]
HAMMOND
Have you completely lost your mind?
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond angrily strolls into the room. Daniel and Catherine are
standing there.]
HAMMOND
Who authorized you to reveal classified information to a civilian?
DANIEL
Sir, if you will just let me explain...
HAMMOND
This is a serious breach of protocol. These rules exist for a
reason, Doctor. Do you think you're above them?
DANIEL
No, no! I--
O'NEILL
Catherine!
[O'Neill casually walks in with Teal'c following.]
CATHERINE
Hello, Jack.
[Smiling fondly, she extends a hand to shake his.]
O'NEILL
It's good to see you again.
[He shakes Catherine's hand.]
O'NEILL
I trust the General is making you feel right at home?
CATHERINE
So far, he actually sounds worse than General West.
O'NEILL
Ah. He's a teddy bear.
HAMMOND
(agitated)
Colonel, did you authorize Dr. Jackson to reveal classified
information to this civilian?
O'NEILL
Absolutely not, sir! In fact, I advised him not to say anything to
her, despite the fact that she used to run the entire program and is
responsible for most of our current knowledge about the 'gate.
HAMMOND
(more calmly)
I'm aware of who she is, Colonel.
DANIEL
Catherine, this is Teal'c. Teal'c, this is Catherine.
[She leans across the table to shake Teal'c's hand.]
CATHERINE
Daniel's told me all about you. Such a pleasure.
[He bows his head. She sits down. Hammond also takes a seat at the
briefing table.]
HAMMOND
Colonel? Are you aware of the request Dr. Jackson has most currently
tabled?
[Stares pointedly at Daniel, then wags a finger at him.]
O'NEILL
You got to go that one step further, don't ya?
[O'Neill takes a seat. Teal'c follows.]
DANIEL
The man who went through the 'gate in 1945 was Catherine's fiancé.
Now, I have the address of the planet he went to, and we can go
there.
CATHERINE
And I'm coming with you.
DANIEL
General, we know where Ernest Littlefield went. He could still be
alive. A man who had the vision to see the 'gate for what it was...a
half a century before anyone else.
O'NEILL
He sounds like a bona fide American hero, sir.
[Carter walks into the room.]
CARTER
Sir, there may be another reason to go to this planet.
CATHERINE
Samantha!
CARTER
(surprised)
Catherine!
[Carter bends down and she and Catherine embrace.]
HAMMOND
(impatiently)
Captain Carter.
CARTER
(sheepishly, she straightens up)
Yes, sir. It seems the planet in question is close to Abydos, so it
uses many of the same points in space as locators, which explains
why the team in '45 could coincidentally dial in without
compensating for planetary shift. But Sir, the planet in question is
not on the cartouche we found on Abydos.
CATHERINE
What's the significance of that?
CARTER
The Goa'ulds haven't charted it. They may not even have been there.
DANIEL
If the Goa'ulds haven't been to this planet, and there's obviously a
'gate there, then we would have unquestionable proof that they
didn't originally build the Stargates.
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld are scavengers. Since they have not traveled to this
planet, we may find technologies we can use against them.
CATHERINE
You speak?
TEAL'C
When it is appropriate.
HAMMOND
(smiles)
Thank you. Thank all of you for your very thorough analysis of the
situation. But I was already convinced by Dr. Jackson's initial
argument. Ernest Littlefield could still be alive, and we should try
to find him.
INT--GATE ROOM
[The wormhole engages and Catherine is arm in arm with O'Neill and
Daniel as she stares awed at the Stargate.]
[The FRED is mobilized and Teal'c and Carter walk up the ramp toward
the event horizon beside it. O'Neill and Daniel follow with Catherine
anxiously walking between them, arms linked with theirs. As they get
closer to the 'gate, they stop and Catherine looks at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
It's a piece of cake.
[O'Neill and Daniel each hold on to her more tightly and O'Neill looks
at her one more time.]
O'NEILL
Ready?
CATHERINE
Yeah.
[They step through the Stargate.]
INT--STARGATE ROOM INSIDE CASTLE, ERNEST'S PLANET
[The room is in shambles. A MALP is there as well as the FRED. Daniel
steadies Catherine as they exit the 'gate.]
DANIEL
You okay?
CATHERINE
Huh! That was some piece of cake.
[SG-1 and Catherine take in the room's interior as all move around to
explore tentatively. It is dark, and the structure creaks and groans.]
DANIEL
It's hot in here.
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah. Did anybody see a way in or out of this place?
TEAL'C
There appears to be only two doorways.
[Carter notices a naked elderly man standing in the doorway of the
room, and is a bit embarrassed.]
CARTER
Oh, my.
[The man starts to walk toward them.]
O'NEILL
Aw. For cryin' out loud.
[Daniel gapes at the man.]
DANIEL
Dr. Littlefield? Ernest?
[The man moves into the room cautiously, and approaches Daniel. He
looks at Daniel through a single spectacle lens.]
DANIEL
Hello, I'm Daniel Jackson. We just came through the Stargate.
[Ernest looks in the direction of the 'gate.]
DANIEL
Yes, uh...that thing. Star...Gate.
[Ernest pushes on Daniel's shoulder.]
DANIEL
We're real.
[Ernest throws his arms around Daniel and begins to sob.]
ERNEST
It's about time.
[Ernest goes to O'Neill and embraces him.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
[Ernest then moves to Teal'c and embraces him while Carter quickly
sidles out of the way.]
CARTER
Oh, boy.
O'NEILL
Daniel, do something.
DANIEL
Uh...Dr. Littlefield?
[Daniel points at Catherine. Ernest looks up and takes in the image of
the older woman for a few moments.]
CATHERINE
You don't recognize me?
ERNEST
C--Catherine?
[He looks at her intently for a moment, then his expression grows
cold.]
ERNEST
Hmmph!
[Ernest turns abruptly and leaves the room.]
CATHERINE
(stunned)
Fifty years. That's all he has to say.
DANIEL
I'll--I'll go s--see if I can find him.
EXT--CASTLE
[Waves pound the cliff underneath the battered structure.]
INT--CASTLE, HELIOPOLIS ROOM
[Daniel descends a staircase.]
ERNEST
Still here?
[Startled, Daniel whirls around and sees Ernest, still naked.]
DANIEL
Uh...Do you have anything to wear?
[Ernest looks at him blankly.]
DANIEL
Clothes?
ERNEST
Oh! Uh--Uh. Going home.
[Daniel averts his eyes while Ernest reaches down and pulls on the
tattered remnants of his diving suit.]
DANIEL
Yes, we're taking you home.
ERNEST
So much time. Did no one try again?
DANIEL
That's a long story. Are there other people here? No one else lives
here? How 'bout nearby?
[Ernest looks at him forlornly and hands Daniel a piece of food.]
DANIEL
Are you saying you've been completely alone here for fifty years?
[Ernest nods 'yes'.]
ERNEST
Eat.
[Daniel looks at him, amazed.]
INT--CASTLE GATE ROOM
[Carter is wandering around behind Catherine, who is seated on the
steps leading to the DHD.]
CATHERINE
I don't know what I expected. I mean, I can't believe he's right
here. Light years away, but still so close all this time. Alive!
[Carter sits down next to Catherine.]
CARTER
I think he's probably having a little trouble dealing with it, too.
CATHERINE
I felt like a schoolgirl. My heart was beating faster than when I
came through the 'gate.
(laughs ironically)
You think you're old and wise.
CARTER
I--I don't think the heart ever grows old.
CATHERINE
(sighs)
I can't even fathom what he's been through. Such a long time. I
don't even know that man.
CARTER
Why don't you go and talk to him?
INT--HELIOPOLIS ROOM
[Daniel is looking at several sheets of old, yellowed papers containing
hash marks.]
ERNEST
Last day.
DANIEL
It's a calendar isn't it?
[Ernest nods, and Daniel pages through it.]
DANIEL
Have you been able to figure out who built this place or who used to
live here?
ERNEST
Heliopolis.
DANIEL
Heliopolis?
ERNEST
Repository, philosophy, astronomy.
DANIEL
I assume you mean the ancient Egyptian city. People would come from
everywhere to gather there. Scholars. Community leaders. It was also
the central place of worship for Ra. Are there ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphs here? Symbols that indicate Ra. This could be very
important.
[Ernest retrieves his journal from his belongings and gives it to
Daniel. Daniel looks over the pages of Ernest's writing and reads from
it.]
DANIEL
"Four distinct languages. Writing is unlike anything on Earth.
Catherine says they're probably alien."
(to Ernest)
Catherine says?
ERNEST
She found me long ago
[Daniel continues reading from journal.]
DANIEL
"We walked for miles today and still found no signs of civilization.
Catherine seems concerned, but I am not. As long as she is here with
me, I will never feel alone. It seems impossible, but everyday we're
here together, I love her more."
[Catherine appears in the room.]
CATHERINE
My father lied to me.
ERNEST
Oh.
DANIEL
Uh. I'll leave you two.
[Daniel leaves the room.]
ERNEST
(to Catherine)
So real.
CATHERINE
Yes. You're going to have to believe. This isn't easy for me,
either.
ERNEST
Y--you--you look--uh--different.
CATHERINE
I'm old, Ernest. So are you.
ERNEST
We--we had a wonderful life together!
CATHERINE
I couldn't imagine you, Ernest. In my mind, we didn't have a
wonderful life. I thought you were dead.
ERNEST
You forgave me. You forgave me long ago.
CATHERINE
No. I didn't.
ERNEST
(near tears)
Oh.
EXT--CASTLE
[A storm rages outside.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[Thunder sounds outside. O'Neill and Teal'c return to the Stargate room
from exploring. Daniel and Carter are seated on the stairs to the DHD
and reviewing Ernest's journal together.]
O'NEILL
Doesn't seem to be anybody else around. I tell you, this place used
to be pretty sweet. But it's seen better days, if you know what I
mean.
DANIEL
I think Professor Littlefield has been alone since he got here.
[Teal'c and O'Neill are stunned.]
O'NEILL
Wow.
TEAL'C
The storm approaches.
[Catherine and Ernest join them in the Stargate room.]
O'NEILL
A pretty big one at that.
ERNEST
It comes every year.
CARTER
Every year?
O'NEILL
Now, look, kids. We're right on the edge of cliff here. I don't
think this place could withstand another big hit.
TEAL'C
We must take our leave.
DANIEL
No, we can't. Not yet. I mean, we've--we've only begun to explore
this place. Figure out what it is, what it used to be.
O'NEILL
We launched a survey balloon. Now, let's take the Professor and
Catherine home. We'll leave the probe here, let it monitor the
situation until the storm blows over, and then we'll come back. All
right?
ERNEST
I tried for years to make it work.
DANIEL
(gesturing toward the DHD)
You never tried entering different glyphs in this thing?
[Daniel rises up from his seat and steps to up the DHD; he can't see
the control ring from where he is.]
DANIEL
We call this the Dial-Home Device. Basically, you enter the correct
address and--
O'NEILL
Daniel. Why do we just show him?
[They all go up the steps to join Daniel at the DHD. They see that the
center crystal is destroyed, broken into pieces.]
CARTER
My God.
O'NEILL
What the hell? I thought the probe was supposed to detect stuff like
this.
[Carter picks at the shards.]
CARTER
We got visual confirmation of its presence, but the damage was
obviously concealed.
[She tries to push in some glyphs. Nothing lights up.]
CARTER
It's not working.
ERNEST
It was like that when I got here.
CATHERINE
(to Ernest)
That's why you never came back.
[Ernest nods sullenly, then looks up.]
ERNEST
Does this mean we're not going home?
EXT--CASTLE
[Storm still rages outside.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[O'Neill and Daniel are lifting a large stone pillar that is in the
way. Carter and Teal'c are working on the DHD.]
ERNEST
Well, since we're going to be here a while, I'd like you to see
something.
DANIEL
What?
ERNEST
Come on. It's the safest room there is. You know? Especially in a
storm.
[He leaves the room, Daniel follows.]
CATHERINE
Give me a hand.
[O'Neill pulls her up.]
CATHERINE
Thanks.
O'NEILL
(to Carter and Teal'c)
Keep at it. We'll be back.
[Catherine and O'Neill follow Ernest and Daniel.]
INT--MEETING PLACE, HELIOPOLIS
[Ernest uncloaks a device with a large crystal in the center.
Immediately four separate walls light up, each bearing four distinct
patterns of alien writing.]
O'NEILL
What is this place?
[Ernest pokes at a page in his journal that Daniel is holding open
indicating he should read it. Daniel reads.]
DANIEL
"I believe this room is some sort of meeting place where four alien
races denoted by the symbols and distinctive writing on the walls
would gather...possibly to share knowledge or discuss relations,
like a United Nations of the stars. Catherine agrees."
CATHERINE
(to Ernest)
You're right. I would have.
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[Carter and Teal'c are still working on the DHD. Carter is working with
some wires and a volt meter inside the broken center crystal.]
CARTER
All roads seem to lead here. Which means this is likely the power
source.
TEAL'C
I believe you are correct.
CARTER
It will take years to figure out how to put these crystals back
properly. I think we might be able to figure out some way to rig the
power source directly to the 'gate and then dial in manually.
INT--MEETING PLACE, HELIOPOLIS
[O'Neill is standing beside the control device. It looks something like
a DHD.]
O'NEILL
This looks familiar.
ERNEST
Touch it.
[O'Neill touches the center crystal, and a beam of light shoots up from
the device and holographic images of spherical, multicolored objects
dot the ceiling.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
CATHERINE
It's beautiful!
O'NEILL
Daniel? Does this mean anything?
DANIEL
Well, if this was a Mecca of sorts--an alien United Nations--this
has to mean something.
[O'Neill looks up and recognizes what he's seeing.]
O'NEILL
I know this.
CATHERINE
Of course! High School chemistry.
DANIEL
One proton, one electron. Hydrogen.
CATHERINE
Beryllium. Sodium.
[O'Neill waves his weapon though one of the projected images.]
ERNEST
Silver, iron, barium, xenon.
CATHERINE
Oh, my God. So many electrons. How can you tell?
ERNEST
I've been here a very long time. Remember?
O'NEILL
Excuse me. Are you saying that all of these are atomic... things?
DANIEL
These images are the graphical representations of the basics
elements: Electrons revolving around the proton. The number of the
electrons indicating the element.
ERNEST
One hundred and forty-six.
CATHERINE
There are currently only one hundred and eleven elements on the
periodic table.
ERNEST
Only ninety when I last looked.
CATHERINE
This is incredible. I mean, we've only been able to speculate on the
actual appearance and structure of an atom. The fact that four
completely alien races chose to represent it visually in an almost
identical way...
DANIEL
The basic elements are what make up the universe. They are the basic
building bl-- Of course!
(excitedly)
How do you ensure universal communication? You reduce the method of
communication to the most basic elements common to everyone and
everything that exists in the universe. Jack, this is a true
universal language.
ERNEST
(to Daniel)
Turn the page.
DANIEL
What?
ERNEST
Turn the page.
[Ernest touches a portion of the device, and another beam of light
shoots up, changing the pattern.]
DANIEL
Are you saying that this-- this is-- this is like a book?
ERNEST
I tried to read it. I tried to understand, but--
DANIEL
A hundred and forty-six elements, letters, or word symbols. If
they're letters, if they're pictographic-- I mean-- this could take
a lifetime.
ERNEST
(sadly)
More.
DANIEL
(sheepishly)
Oh. Sorry.
O'NEILL
(moving closer to Daniel)
Daniel, before your head explodes, may I remind you that we've got
more important things to deal with right now?
DANIEL
How can you say that? Don't you know what this could mean?
O'NEILL
Actually, no.
DANIEL
This could be the key to understanding our existence. Everyone,
everything's existence.
ERNEST
A collaboration of the knowledge of these four alien species.
O'NEILL
None of which will mean squat if we don't get out of here.
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[Carter and Teal'c are still working on the DHD. They are stringing
battery cables and wires from the 'gate to the DHD. O'Neill and
Catherine join them.]
O'NEILL
How's it goin'?
CARTER
We're trying to connect the power source from the Dial-Home Device
directly into the 'gate. I'm about to run a test. Where's Daniel?
O'NEILL
Oh, Ernest is showing him a new toy.
CARTER
Really? What?
O'NEILL
Some fancy light show that may be the key to our existence or
something like that.
[Lightning crashes and some debris falls from the ceiling. The building
creaks ominously.]
O'NEILL
Uh, you wanna pick up the pace on this a little bit?
[Carter connects a wire and the 'gate begins to power up, with chevrons
lighting.]
CATHERINE
You did it!
[The gate powers down. As they stand there, the ceiling creaks again
and O'Neill grabs Carter by the vest and pulls her away.]
O'NEILL
Get back!
[They tumble down the stairs together as the ceiling crashes down where
they were just standing. Teal'c and Catherine run to them as they pick
themselves up from the rubble.]
CATHERINE
Are you all right?
[They all look back at the DHD and go back to where it was. All four
see a gaping hole in the floor where the DHD used to be. The sea
crashes on the rocks below.]
INT--MEETING ROOM, HELIOPOLIS
[Daniel and Ernest are studying a wall with one of the alien languages
on it.]
DANIEL
This is how you knew what this place was.
ERNEST
Then you recognize it, too.
DANIEL
Othala, the Norse Rune thought to represent the collection of
numinous power and knowledge from past generations.
ERNEST
And the gathering of clans to share a common interest. You know,
there's more than just a coincidence here. That means that humans
were here centuries, maybe eons ago.
DANIEL
Not humans-- aliens. This is Thor's race.
ERNEST
Thor was an alien?
DANIEL
Oh, yeah. That's uh-- That's another...long story. But a...good one.
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c are working with the power wires.]
O'NEILL
All right. Basic survival training. We know what we have. What do we
need?
[O'Neill walks over to Catherine who is seated on some rubble.]
TEAL'C
We have the Stargate. We need the Dial-Home Device.
O'NEILL
Thank you, Teal'c.
CARTER
The element the 'gate is made up of absorbs energy directly.
Internal functions will convert and store that energy in
capacitor-like reservoirs. But the inside wheel will only unlock and
spin freely once there's enough reserve power.
O'NEILL
So what we need is energy.
CARTER
Mm-hmm. I don't see any electrical outlets. Do you?
INT--MEETING ROOM, HELIOPOLIS
[The elements are whirling slowly around the room. Daniel is trying to
videotape the images from different angles.]
DANIEL
This is useless. It's not allowing for any relative perspective. I
don't understand. How did you incorporate the three-dimensional
nature of the information?
ERNEST
Look down.
[Daniel looks at Ernest then looks down to the floor. There are radial,
pie-shaped markings on the floor.]
DANIEL
Of course. You measured the element's distance from a central point.
Degrees from zero around in a circle, and height above the floor.
[O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Catherine descend the stairs to the
Meeting Room. Daniel notices them finally.]
DANIEL
What's up, guys?
O'NEILL
Step away from the pedestal, Daniel.
DANIEL
What? Why?
CARTER
The Dial-Home Devices just fell through the floor into the ocean.
DANIEL
So, what are we going to do?
CARTER
That thing may have a power source in it that we can use to get the
'gate working.
DANIEL
Uh...No!
(appalled)
You don't understand-- this book may contain knowledge of the
universe. I mean, this is... meaning-of-life stuff. I have to get
more of it down on paper before we leave. There has to be something
more you can use. What about using energy from Teal'c's staff?
CARTER
It isn't powerful enough.
CATHERINE
Daniel, please. There's not much time. We have to get inside that
thing.
O'NEILL
This whole place can join the DHD at the bottom of the ocean at any
minute, so please...
[O'Neill sweeps an arc with his hand, indicating that Daniel should
move away. Daniel looks at O'Neill irritably.]
DANIEL
Great. Shoot it.
[Daniel walks away disgustedly. Teal'c aims his staff weapon and shoots
the device. Nothing happens. O'Neill moves closer to it.]
DANIEL
Now what?
[O'Neill studies the device as thunder sounds rather loudly around
them. All look up at the noise.]
O'NEILL
I'm obviously no scientist, but uh, couldn't we use that Ben
Franklin thing?
INT--ENTRANCE TO CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[O'Neill and Carter walk into the Stargate room as Carter is talking.
They are followed by Teal'c and Catherine.]
CARTER
The element the 'gate is made up of is a superconductor. It'll
absorb energy in many forms: heat, nuclear, solar, static. If we
could channel a lightning strike into the 'gate, it might provide us
with enough power to dial in and make it though.
TEAL'C
How do we attract lightning to strike the 'gate?
CARTER
Well, not directly. We'll have to rig something up on the roof...and
hope that the sudden and enormous charge doesn't destroy the 'gate's
mechanisms.
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[A mass of wires is laid out. O'Neill is standing in a window; he grabs
a wire presumably from Teal'c who is on the roof.]
O'NEILL
I got it, Teal'c!
[O'Neill climbs down and pulls the wire over to the 'gate where Carter
is to wrap the wire around the ring; she connects what appear to be
heavy-duty jumper cables to the wire. In the meantime, Ernest is
rummaging through the rubble looking for something and Catherine enters
the room.]
CATHERINE
Daniel won't come up. He's obsessed with that thing. So much like
you used to be.
[They both chuckle lightly at her comment.]
ERNEST
The Torment of Tantalus.
CATHERINE
What?
ERNEST
Tantalus was a king in Greek mythology, banished to Hades, forced to
stand in water that receded when he tried to drink.
CATHERINE
Everlasting, unending temptation.
ERNEST
He was reaching for something that was...um...out of reach.
CATHERINE
That sounds familiar. Some might say that's what makes a man great.
If we all accepted what was within our grasp--
ERNEST
Sometimes what we have is of more value. It takes a great man to
recognize that. I didn't. I was a fool.
CATHERINE
Ernest, you've suffered enough. No sense wasting time in the past.
Right?
[They look at each other for a few moments, then Ernest looks away. He
spies something in the rubble that he was looking for.]
ERNEST
Ah, look. For the peak of the roof.
[He pulls out the old diving helmet he used when he came through the
'gate.]
ERNEST
It will attract the lightning.
[He hands the helmet to Catherine.]
CATHERINE
You get Daniel.
[Ernest leaves, and Catherine takes the helmet to Teal'c, who's just
walked into the room, and hands it to him.]
CATHERINE
Take this to the roof.
INT--THE MEETING ROOM, HELIOPOLIS
[Ernest makes his way down the stairs as Daniel stands over the device
and pores over a large book, making notes.]
ERNEST
You have to come...now!
DANIEL
Not yet. Come and get me when they've got the 'gate running.
ERNEST
There isn't enough time.
DANIEL
I have to finish this.
ERNEST
It's not worth it.
DANIEL
This is.
ERNEST
Nothing is.
DANIEL
Well, our history as a people would be very different if everyone
felt that way.
[Ernest grabs Daniel's arm.]
ERNEST
No prize is worth attaining if you can never share it! There would
be no point! Believe me.
(nearly crying)
I know.
[Daniel looks hard at Ernest.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[Teal'c is crouched down positioning a wire along the ground. He walks
to the assembled group who are waiting for lightning to strike and for
Ernest and Daniel to appear.]
EXT--THE CASTLE TOWERS
[There are a couple of claps of thunder and a lightning bolt finally
hits the helmet at the top of the spire.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[The lightning travels along the wire and encircles the rings via the
wires wrapped around it.]
CARTER
Let's go, Teal'c! Start dialing in! We may only have seconds once
the 'gate is open.
[O'Neill makes his way out of the room and heads out to find Daniel and
Ernest.]
INT--THE MEETING ROOM
[Daniel stands over the device while Ernest is by the stairs.]
DANIEL
What you did was courageous.
ERNEST
What I did was stupid.
[O'Neill comes down the steps.]
O'NEILL
Come on, boys! We got to go, now!
DANIEL
I'm staying.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
Look, I will be fine down here.
O'NEILL
(to Ernest)
Go on. Go on. Daniel, we can come back.
DANIEL
No. What if the castle crumbles around the 'gate? I mean, this--
this could all be lost. If I stay I could unbury the 'gate again.
O'NEILL
What if the 'gate falls into the ocean?
[O'Neill moves closer to Daniel.]
DANIEL
I'm willing to take that risk!
O'NEILL
I'm not!
[O'Neill grabs Daniel by the back of his vest.]
O'NEILL
Let's go!
[O'Neill pulls Daniel away from the device and toward the stairs.]
DANIEL
Jack!
[They stop, and, still keeping a firm grip on Daniel, O'Neill looks at
him intently.]
DANIEL
(pleading)
Please.
[O'Neill looks at him for a moment, then releases him, shaking his
head. He watches as Daniel makes his way back over to the device, looks
at it momentarily and up at the ceiling. He bends over to pick up the
book and notes that had fallen to the ground. Turning away he makes his
way over to the stairs; O'Neill slaps him on the back and follows him
up the stairs.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[The wormhole is established and Ernest and Catherine are poised to
enter the event horizon. Carter waves them on through.]
CARTER
Let's go!
[Ernest hesitates to enter. Catherine smiles at him.]
CATHERINE
It's a piece of cake.
ERNEST
Not from what I remember.
CATHERINE
Go.
[Both Catherine and Ernest go through. Teal'c looks back for O'Neill
and Daniel.]
CARTER
Go, Teal'c.
[Reluctantly, he goes through the 'gate. Carter looks up as the ceiling
begins to crumble.]
[Daniel and O'Neill come running in the room and dive for cover as a
portion of the ceiling comes down behind them. They scramble to their
feet, and O'Neill pushes Daniel up.]
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Go!
[Carter runs into the wormhole, and O'Neill and Daniel run up the
stairs as more debris falls from the ceiling. The dive onto the stairs
up to the 'gate.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Klaxons are sounding and General Hammond is watching from the Control
Room as the event horizon shimmers.]
[Carter stands by anxiously waiting for O'Neill and Daniel to come
through.]
HARRIMAN
(into intercomm)
Wormhole is destabilizing. Still no travelers.
CARTER
Come on, guys.
[Teal'c stands on the ramp watching the flickering event horizon.
Ernest and Catherine are seated on the ramp and receiving medical
attention from some med techs.]
INT--CASTLE'S GATE ROOM
[The wormhole continues to flicker while O'Neill and Daniel try to rise
up to their feet. Daniel gets up and dives though, followed closely by
O'Neill who dives in right behind him.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The wormhole flickers, then Daniel and O'Neill finally fall out of the
event horizon onto the ramp. Recovering, they are joined by Teal'c and
Carter who help them to their feet.]
DANIEL
Close one.
O'NEILL
Ya think?
CARTER
You don't know how close.
[They move off the ramp as Hammond and Harriman look on worriedly from
the control room.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is revolving. From inside the control room, Daniel,
Ernest, O'Neill, and Catherine look on as the coordinates for Ernest's
planet are entered.]
HARRIMAN
Chevron Six encoded...Chevron Seven...will not engage.
[O'Neill and Catherine look down disappointedly. Daniel turns away from
the window and sits down dejectedly.]
O'NEILL
Well, I think it's safe to say the place is gone.
ERNEST
(hopefully, to Daniel)
You still have my book.
CATHERINE
Captain Carter's working on a computer model right now.
O'NEILL
And here's the bright side: you're alive.
DANIEL
Yes.
(to Ernest)
Thanks to you.
ERNEST
Look at it this way: If you ever run into those aliens who made up
the language, you can ask them what it means.
CATHERINE
You'd better let us know this time.
DANIEL
I will. I promise.
[Ernest grabs Daniel in a sudden embrace, and Daniel laughs. O'Neill
then rises out of his chair.]
O'NEILL
Catherine! Hug me.
[Catherine laughs and embraces O'Neill.]
CATHERINE
Oh, Jack!
[Catherine lets go of O'Neill and looks at Ernest, who's gazing back
fondly at her. They embrace warmly as O'Neill and Daniel look on
appreciatively.]
