EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter is seated next to her computer monitor, which shows a schematic
of a space ship. Daniel and Teal'c are there.]
CARTER
The Daedalus. It has a few advantages over the Prometheus. The more
advanced alien technologies were integrated into the original design
rather than tacked on after the fact.
DANIEL
When's it going to be ready?
CARTER
Well, they're already testing the Asgard hyperdrive. As soon as that
checks out, she'll be good to go.
DANIEL
Hopefully, we all get to go this time.
CARTER
Last time, they were worried about spreading our resources too thin.
DANIEL
Yeah, now that Anubis is gone, the Replicators are gone...
[Teal'c smiles broadly.]
CARTER
There's still a few System Lords out there, but without their Jaffa
armies, they've lost most of their power.
TEAL'C
(smiling)
Indeed.
[The phone rings and Carter picks it up.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Carter. Yeah, hold on.
(handing phone to Daniel)
It's for you.
DANIEL
Hello. Yeah, hi...
(concerned and surprised)
What? No, I was just talking to her last week... Yeah, I'll be
there. Thank you.
[He lowers the phone. He looks sad and disturbed.]
CARTER
What is it?
DANIEL
Catherine Langford died last night.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--AT THE GRAVESIDE OF CATHERINE LANGFORD, DAY
[The wooden casket is sitting on the ground above where it will be
buried, bouquets of flowers around it. It is raining and most of the
thirty or so people there are holding umbrellas. Daniel is standing on
the opposite side of the casket speaking to the mourners. He is dressed
in a dark suit.]
DANIEL
Catherine Langford was more than just kind and generous. She had a
gift... of an endless, open minded, childlike curiosity. She saw the
world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And she saw
potential in people that others failed to recognize. Like her father
before her, her contributions to science have changed the world more
than most people know. I, for one, have no idea where I would be
today if I'd never met her. She changed my life in more ways than I
ever could have imagined.
[A bit later, people are placing roses on the coffin as Daniel remains
standing near it. The mourners are dispersing. A young woman with long
red hair approaches Daniel from behind.]
SABRINA
Uh, Doctor Jackson?
[Daniel turns to face her.]
SABRINA
Hi.
DANIEL
(stepping under her umbrella)
Hi.
SABRINA
I'm Sabrina Gosling. I'm Catherine's niece.
DANIEL
(shaking her hand and smiling)
Oh yes, of course.
SABRINA
I just wanted to thank you for coming, and for speaking. I know she
would have really appreciated it.
DANIEL
No, it was uh, it was an honor.
SABRINA
(smiling and laughing gently)
You know, my Aunt used to talk about you all the time. It's funny, I
always used to picture some Indiana Jones type with a bullwhip and a
pistol, chasing bad guys through some ancient temple.
DANIEL
Yeah, well I generally leave the whip at home, so...
SABRINA
(laughing)
Right. Yeah, me too.
(pulling out the golden Eye of Ra pendant Catherine had given Daniel
before the original mission)
Uh, she uh, wanted you to have this.
DANIEL
No, you're family. You should keep that.
SABRINA
She thought of you like a son.
[She gives it to him.]
DANIEL
Thank you.
SABRINA
There are a few other odds and ends she wanted me to give you, but I
wasn't able to bring them today. Is there an address where I can
send them?
DANIEL
Yeah, of course.
SABRINA
Great.
[They exchange smiles.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DANIEL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is leaning casually against the wall as two airman leave
Daniel's office with empty hand trucks. Daniel arrives and is surprised
by all of the activity.]
DANIEL
Jack?
O'NEILL
Daniel?
[More airmen leave Daniel's office, followed by Siler.]
DANIEL
What's goin' on?
O'NEILL
You been shoppin' on line lately?
[Siler hands O'Neill a clipboard and leaves.]
DANIEL
Whatcha talkin' about?
O'NEILL
(handing Daniel the clipboard)
Well, you got a little delivery here.
DANIEL
(reading the clipboard paperwork)
It's from Catherine's estate.
O'NEILL
Yeah, kinda looks like she sent the whole thing.
[Daniel finally walks into his office, finding it completely full of
boxes and artifacts.]
DANIEL
Holy... Looks like her entire collection.
O'NEILL
(patting Daniel on the shoulder)
I prefer stamps.
[O'Neill leaves; Daniel is in a state of shock.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Dr. Cameron Balinsky is enthusiastically showing some cored-out rock
samples to O'Neill as another scientist looks on. O'Neill is obviously
bored, resting his head in his hand.]
BALINSKY
(holding up one of the samples)
Now, in addition, we discovered several grains of troilite, and a
mesostasis phase which contained micrometer crystals.
O'NEILL
(in the style of Homer Simpson)
Hmmmm...
BALINSKY
Now it's undergoing further testing, but we hope to have the results
on your desk first thing tomorrow morning.
O'NEILL
(shaking a piece of the rock, clearly not serious)
Don't you keep me waiting!
BALINSKY
No, sir.
(taking a different sample from his colleague and showing it to
O'Neill)
Now here's where things get really interesting, because you will
notice in this fissure--
[Daniel comes running into the room.]
DANIEL
Jack! We need to-- We need to talk. Oh, sorry for interrupting.
O'NEILL
(grabbing Daniel very firmly by the forearm)
No! It's okay. If it's important, you must interrupt. You must.
[Balinsky nods, disappointed.]
DANIEL
(grimacing slightly)
I think we may have found a ZPM.
O'NEILL
(leaping to his feet)
Yes!
(patting Balinsky on the shoulder without letting go of Daniel)
Great stuff with the rocks.
[Daniel turns and begins to jog out of the room. Jack pats him on the
back and follows.]
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Teal'c stands near Daniel, with Carter and O'Neill on the opposite
side of the table. Daniel is pulling out a large book from the many
items Catherine left him.]
DANIEL
Among the items Catherine left me, this one in particular caught my
attention. It's an original 1889 edition of The Eye Of The Sun. It's
uh, the only one in known existence. It details the customs and
rituals observed by the ancient worshippers of the Sun God, Ra. Now,
while I was flipping through the pages, I noticed this.
[He points in the book to a drawing of a man holding a cylinder with
shapes inside it. The rays of the sun are shining down upon him.]
TEAL'C
It appears to be a Zero Point Module.
DANIEL
The worshippers of Ra referred to it as the 'Heart of Light'. This
is a reproduction of a wall painting discovered by German
archaeologists in 1885. It was destroyed in a museum fire ten years
later.
CARTER
But the ZPM was never found?
DANIEL
No.
[O'Neill looks at Carter, uncertain.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 and O'Neill are seated at the table. Carter slides some paper
diagrams over to O'Neill.]
CARTER
We did an extensive satellite sweep of the Giza Plateau searching
for an energy signature like the one given off by the ZPM we found
near Taonas. Even if it's buried under dirt and rock, we should have
been able to detect it. We found nothing. I'm sorry, Daniel, but if
it's there, it's probably been depleted.
DANIEL
No, I don't think so. According to the text, it was a religious
artifact, an icon. It was never used as a power source.
TEAL'C
It is possible Ra simply took the device with him when he left
Earth.
CARTER
In which case, it could be anywhere by now.
DANIEL
(looking a bit sheepish)
We don't know where it is now, but we do know where it was. Giza,
3000 B.C.
CARTER
(shaking her head)
You can't be serious.
O'NEILL
(confused)
What.
DANIEL
It's the only way.
O'NEILL
What.
CARTER
No, we agreed.
O'NEILL
If I have to say 'what' one more time, heads are gonna roll!
DANIEL
We have a time machine. We can go back and get the ZPM.
O'NEILL
(annoyed)
She wouldn't let me go back and watch the Cubs win the World Series.
DANIEL
Jack, this is a unique opportunity. Ra never knew what he had, which
means we can go back and take it without adversely affecting the
timeline.
CARTER
Actually, sir, he may be right about that.
O'NEILL
You're on board with this?
CARTER
I'm not happy about it, but we don't have any historical evidence to
show that any Goa'uld has ever used a ZPM. In which case, it
wouldn't be missed. We would have to be extremely careful to
minimize our interaction with the people of the period.
O'NEILL
Yeah, there's that. But I thought you said you couldn't get it to
work?
CARTER
No one at Area 51 has been able to engage the time device. In fact,
they've barely gotten the ship off the ground. But you were able to
fly it without too much difficulty.
TEAL'C
Indeed. You have demonstrated an exceptional ability to control
Ancient devices.
DANIEL
Jack, think about it. With a fully functional ZPM, we could power
Earth's defenses and open up a wormhole to the Pegasus Galaxy.
[O'Neill looks at Carter, who nods in agreement. O'Neill looks
thoughtful but unconvinced.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[The Puddle Jumper with the time device is flying above Earth.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Daniel and O'Neill are sitting in the pilot chairs as Carter works on
the time device. Teal'c is standing behind Daniel.]
DANIEL
Now remember, Jack, 3000 B.C. After Sam hooks up the power to the
time device, think about that date and nothing else.
O'NEILL
This thing's Ancient. How's it gonna know from B.C.?
CARTER
Your mind is controlling it. The Ancient computer should be able to
extrapolate from your concept of time.
O'NEILL
Well, shouldn't we test it on a slightly smaller leap? Like say, to
1908?
CARTER
Actually sir, we were able to determine from the data log that the
technology only works in time jumps longer than a couple hundred
years.
[The time device comes to life after Carter's efforts.]
CARTER
I think that's it.
DANIEL
3000 B.C.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Any particular day in the century for ya?
[Daniel closes his eyes, encouraging O'Neill to focus on the proper
date. O'Neill closes his eyes and places his hands on the controls.
Behind him the device comes to life, humming more and more loudly.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[The Puddle Jumper is briefly enveloped in a distortion wave.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The time device is becoming quiet again.]
O'NEILL
What happened?
DANIEL
I didn't feel anything.
CARTER
(walking forward, to Daniel)
The time machine pulsed. Try the radio.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Stargate Command, this is Daniel Jackson, do you read? Stargate
Command, this is Daniel Jackson, come in please.
[There is nothing but static in response. Teal'c gets up and looks out
the view screen.]
TEAL'C
The stars are different.
CARTER
Earth was in a different orbit around the Sun 5000 years ago. I
think we did it.
O'NEILL
(rather pleased)
Huh.
EXT--EARTH DESERT, 3000 B.C., DAY
[The Puddle Jumper sits on the sands of Egypt.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[O'Neill finishes dressing in Egyptian robes over his vest and weapons.
Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are also dressed in robes and turbans.
Daniel is preparing a video camera.]
DANIEL
I can't believe I'm finally gonna get proof that the Great Pyramids
pre-date the Fourth Dynasty.
CARTER
So what are you gonna do, stand in the picture holding a newspaper
with today's date?
DANIEL
This is an archaeologist's dream. I'm gonna get as much footage as I
can.
CARTER
Just be careful. We're here for the ZPM. In and out. Minimal
interaction, minimal impact.
DANIEL
No problem.
CARTER
I mean it! All of you. Sir.
O'NEILL
I got it. I got it.
CARTER
(handing him a small metal device)
You're gonna need this. We've determined that it remotely activates
the ship's cloak.
O'NEILL
Nice.
[They leave the ship via the back ramp.]
EXT--EARTH DESERT, 3000 B.C., DAY
[The team walks away from the ship. O'Neill turns and activates the
device and the ship disappears behind its cloak.]
EXT--EGYPTIAN VILLAGE, 3000 B.C., DAY
[There is a small village with large tents and several camp fires. Two
huge pyramids are visible in the background. Children play with a ball
as the adults do the work of the village. O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c
look on as Daniel speaks two local men. He bows to the men and walks
back to the others.]
DANIEL
Well, my Ancient Egyptian's a little rusty, but I think I got the
gist of what they're saying. That's Katep and his brother, Silatis.
O'NEILL
Hey guys!
[Daniel shakes his head at O'Neill and pushes his waving arm down.]
DANIEL
They're on a pilgrimage to the Temple of Ra to make an offering.
O'NEILL
Oh, there's timing.
DANIEL
Tomorrow. I told them we were travelers from the East, and they
offered to put us up for the night.
CARTER
I was kind of hoping we wouldn't have to stay that long. I'm sorry,
I keep thinking I'm gonna step on a bug and change the future.
DANIEL
Well, we can't just walk into the temple unannounced. A public
audience is the perfect way to get inside.
CARTER
(looking at O'Neill)
We just have to keep a low profile.
O'NEILL
Yes. But more importantly, did they say what was for dinner?
[Daniel looks at him, very puzzled.]
INT--TEMPLE OF RA
[Katep, Silatis, and other pilgrims enter. The brothers are carrying a
large basket between them. They set it down in front of the altar. The
team enters last, trying not to be noticed.]
JAFFA
Kree! Tal lok!
[Katep and the others go to their knees, as does the team. Ra enters,
his head completely covered in a large metal headdress shaped into a
stylized face. Female acolytes help him to ascend to the altar, and he
sits on a bench-like throne.]
JAFFA
Shal'ta!
[Nervously, the brothers take the cover from their basket and wait as
Ra looks inside to see it filled with beaded and gold jewelry.]
RA
Vash'nel. Vash'nel jal'na.
[Realizing that Ra is not pleased, Silatus pulls some of the jewelry
out of the basket, trying to show its worth. The Jaffa urges him back
with a staff. O'Neill looks on and tilts his head toward Daniel.]
DANIEL
I don't think he was too impressed with the offering.
RA
To'na a'kel no'tar. Zoya noc shom.
DANIEL
He says he will not tolerate such disrespect from his followers.
[The Jaffa activates his staff weapon and begins to aim it at the
brothers. O'Neill reaches under his robe and draws his pistol.]
CARTER
(warningly)
Sir.
O'NEILL
(coldly)
Let me do it now; I won't have to do it in 5000 years.
CARTER
You can't do that. There's no telling what effect it might have.
[Ra gives the signal, and the Jaffa shoots Silatus, killing him. The
team looks horrified. Katep bows awaiting his fate. Ra rises, turns,
and leaves with his acolytes.]
JAFFA
Kree! Ree a'noc.
[Katep runs with other pilgrims to his brother's body. The team gets up
and hides around a corner as others leave. Two Jaffa take the offering
away, leaving the room empty. The team sees this from behind a pillar.]
DANIEL
It's gotta be some sort of treasure room. If the ZPM is anywhere,
it'll be in there.
[A lone Jaffa walks down the corridor. O'Neill zats him. He and Teal'c
pull him out of the hallway.]
INT--TEMPLE OF RA
[Teal'c finishes dressing in the Jaffa's uniform.]
O'NEILL
You really think they're gonna let him just waltz in and take it?
DANIEL
Well, like I said, they don't even know what the ZPM is. To them,
it's like any number of dozens of ritualistic objects they pull out
for any number of occasions. Besides, he's wearing the shiny suit.
[Teal'c activates the helmet and it forms into place around his head.]
O'NEILL
Good luck.
EXT--DESERT OF EGYPT, DAY
[The statue of the Sphinx sits in its early form, in front of a large
pyramid.]
INT--TEMPLE OF RA
[O'Neill looks around a corner, Zat in hand. He checks his watch.
Carter and Daniel are waiting with him.]
O'NEILL
(impatient)
Come on, T.
DANIEL
We would have heard something if he was in trouble.
[Jaffa footsteps are heard and a Jaffa approaches, his face hidden
behind his helmet. It is Teal'c, and he holds out the ZPM, which is
glowing with energy.]
O'NEILL
(taking the ZPM from Teal'c, smiling at him)
Nice!
EXT--DESERT OF EGYPT, DAY
[The team approaches the Puddle Jumper stealthily, dropping down to
hide behind some sand dunes in order to have a look. There are voices,
and when the team looks they see that the while the Jumper is still
invisible, it has been partially covered with sand that has formed
around it. It has been discovered and is surrounded by Jaffa.]
CARTER
Oh my god!
O'NEILL
(casually)
All right, we got a little problem here.
DANIEL
Must have been a sandstorm during the night.
TEAL'C
The Jaffa will soon call for reinforcements if they have not already
done so. We must move quickly.
[O'Neill pulls out his weapon.]
CARTER
Sir, we can't!
O'NEILL
We've taken on more Jaffa than that.
CARTER
You know what I mean. This is exactly the sort of high-impact event
we're supposed to avoid.
TEAL'C
They have the ship. Will that not alter the future more than
anything that we could do?
CARTER
Not necessarily. They don't know what it is, and even if they did,
they can't use it. None of them have the gene. Even Ra won't be able
to make it work.
DANIEL
So what are we supposed to do?
CARTER
Nothing.
O'NEILL
Nothing?
CARTER
Well, close to it.
O'NEILL
No, here's a better idea. We take back our ship!
CARTER
Sir, we kill those Jaffa, or worse, get captured, and we could alter
the future immeasurably. If you're thinking we could go forward and
then back again...
O'NEILL
Just a couple of days! Then we park that thing where nobody can find
it.
CARTER
We alter this timeline, and the future is already different. We
could set into motion a spiral of changes that we could never fix.
We've already done too much. I'm sorry, sir, I should never have
allowed us to do this.
[They get up and begin walking away from the ship and the Jaffa.]
EXT--DESERT OF EGYPT, DAY
[The team is walking in single file through sand dunes, presumably on a
path back to the village.]
O'NEILL
So what? We live out the rest of our lives here?
CARTER
Well, we know there's gonna be a rebellion eventually. The human
slaves rise up, and Ra abandons Earth. Daniel learned that on Abydos
nine years ago. When it happens, there is a chance that we could get
the Jumper back without creating too big a ripple in the events of
this timeline.
O'NEILL
When does that happen?
DANIEL
Well, I don't know the exact date. It could be years.
O'NEILL
What? Years?
CARTER
Sir, we don't have a choice.
O'NEILL
Carter, what about the ZPM? If we wait, we lose any chance of
getting it back to our time.
CARTER
Preserving the timeline is more important.
O'NEILL
For all you know, things could get better!
CARTER
Or, they could be worse! We can't take that chance.
DANIEL
Well, I know a way we can get the ZPM back to our time, even if we
don't. About a month before we left, there was an archaeological dig
that uncovered a First Dynasty tomb near Giza. All we have to do is
bury the ZPM in that tomb, let them find it, and maybe our future
selves won't have to take on this mission.
CARTER
Wow. That's bizarre, but it just might work.
O'NEILL
Carter, a lot of good people died when Anubis attacked Earth. I
don't think their families would mind if we futzed with the timeline
a little.
CARTER
Sir, I know this is hard for you. Your instinct is to change things,
make things better. But for once, that's exactly what we can't do.
We have to let things play out exactly the way they're meant to.
PRESENT DAY, ALTERED REALITY
The altered reality versions of the Stargate characters will be
referred to as Alternate 'Name'.
INT--A CLASSROOM
[Alternate Daniel is standing in front of a chalk board with some
simple explanations of the English parts of speech. He has shaggy hair
parted in the middle, glasses with thick black frames, and is wearing a
knit vest over a short-sleeved shirt and a tie.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
English is a complex language. A hybrid of many different
influences, much like the culture it represents. To understand it is
to gain an insight into that culture and the process of integration
that created it.
[Alternate Daniel looks out on his audience, a group of non-English
speaking immigrants who appear to not have understood what he just
said.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Okay, uh, let's start with a simple greeting. Often, the best way to
begin interacting with someone is to find a topic of common
interest. Everyone can relate to the weather, so let's start with
that, shall we? Introduce yourself and talk about the weather.
[A young man raises his hand.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yes.
[The young man stands up.]
CARLOS
(in a Spanish accent)
Hello, my name is Carlos. You make me so hot.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(smiling but a bit uncomfortable)
Okay, uh, not quite right, but the introduction part was good.
[The door opens and a man looks in; he appears to work for the school.]
CRANDALL
Daniel? Uh, sorry to bother you, but there are some people here to
see you.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(making a time-out sign with his hands)
Uh, excuse me for just one second.
[He goes to the door.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(to Crandall)
What kind of people?
CRANDALL
Air Force people?
[He opens the door further to reveal Alternate Major Davis and two
other officers standing in the hallway. Alternate Davis has a
mustache.]
EXT--DEPARTMENT OF AEROSPACE RESEARCH HEADQUARTERS, WASHINGTON, D.C.,
DAY
INT--OFFICE INSIDE THE AEROSPACE BUILDING
[Alternate Carter is there. She has short hair and is wearing glasses.
She is dressed in conservative clothes in earth-tones.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
This is totally unbelievable! You are a small and pathetic man!
Those were my theories on spin wave technology and the effects of
anti-gravity on electromagnetism, and you know it!
[She looks at the empty desk of the man she has been pretending to yell
at.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
Now, just because my reproductive organs are on the inside instead
of the outside, doesn't... God! That's horrible! Who would ever say
that?
[The door opens and a man enters.]
DR. HIRSHFIELD
Carter.
(looking around the office)
Who you talking to?
ALTERNATE CARTER
No one.
DR. HIRSHFIELD
Are you talking to yourself?
ALTERNATE CARTER
No.
DR. HIRSHFIELD
Have you proof-read my review of the solid fuel rocket ship?
ALTERNATE CARTER
I'm almost done. Good job!
DR. HIRSHFIELD
Thank you. Keep up the good work, Carter; you'll be moving up around
here.
[He gives her an up and down look and she looks down at herself. The
door opens and Alternate Davis and the other officers appear. Alternate
Davis enters the room.]
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Excuse me. Major Davis, United States Air Force.
DR. HIRSHFIELD
Dr. Hirshfield.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
(shaking his hand)
I know who you are.
DR. HIRSHFIELD
What's this all about?
ALTERNATE DAVIS
It's a matter of national security. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to
discuss that here.
DR. HIRSHFIELD
(looking behind him at Carter)
Oh, of course, by all means. We can talk privately in my office.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Oh no, I'm not here to talk to you. I'd like to speak to Dr. Carter.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(amazed and nervous)
Me?
EXT--A BOATING DOCK, DAY
[Alternate O'Neill sits on the aft deck of his rather dingy commercial
fishing boat, the Homer, watching a customer leave. Dressed in khaki's
and a plaid shirt, he tosses an empty beer can to the corner of the
boat. Alternate Major Samuels and two other officers walk to the edge
of Alternate O'Neill's boat via the dock.]
ALTERNATE SAMUELS
Colonel O'Neill.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Samuels. You and the boys looking to charter a boat for the day?
ALTERNATE SAMUELS
No, sir. I've been sent by the Pentagon to escort you back to
Washington.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
I could give a rat's butt.
ALTERNATE SAMUELS
It's a matter of national security, sir.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Find someone else.
[He stands and starts to move around the aft deck.]
ALTERNATE SAMUELS
We can't. It has to be you. Now if you'll allow me, I'll try and
explain it on the way.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Sammy, it just doesn't sound like fun.
[As the Air Force men look on, Alternate O'Neill hops up to the bridge
of the boat, groaning as he does so. He starts the engine and begins
driving the boat away from the dock. He lifts his arms in a vee-shaped
stretch, as if affirming his freedom.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Alternate Daniel is standing in the room alone when the door opens.
Alternate Davis ushers Alternate Carter into the room. They are both
wearing conservative, unfashionable earth-toned clothes.]
ALTERNATE DAVIS
If you'll just wait here, Ma'am, General Hammond will be with you in
a moment.
[He shuts the door on them.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Hi.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Hi.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(reaching out to shake her hand vigorously)
Doctor Daniel Jackson.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Doctor Samantha Carter.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(grimacing in case she misunderstood)
Oh! Ah, Ph.D.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Oh, me too. Astrophysics.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Oh, Egyptology!
ALTERNATE CARTER
You wouldn't happen to know why we're here?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(laughing)
Oh, 5000 years ago maybe, but uh now, no. I was kinda hoping you
did.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Sorry.
[There is a moment of silence as they can't think of what to say to
each other.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
I teach English as a Second Language.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Department of Aerospace.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Oh!
ALTERNATE CARTER
Not as an Astronaut!
(laughing nervously)
No, I uh... I check other peoples' scientific reports for factual
errors or omissions before they get sent up to the Director.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(nodding)
Interesting.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Yeah, not really.
[Alternate Hammond enters.]
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson, Doctor Carter, I am General George Hammond.
(gesturing for them to sit)
Please.
[They sit next to each other and open the files Hammond has placed in
front of them.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
What's this?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
A non-disclosure agreement. What we're about to discuss has been
classified Top Secret by the United States Government.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(closing the file and placing his hands on top of it)
What if we don't want to sign it?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
(gesturing toward the door)
Well then, you're free to leave.
[Alternate Carter grabs a pen without hesitation and signs very
quickly. Alternate Daniel concedes and does the same. They pass the
signed documents to Alternate Hammond, who gives them the Top Secret
files.]
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
You have a background in archaeology, isn't that right, Doctor
Jackson?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
That's right.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
But your theories failed to gain much acceptance among your
colleagues.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
You could say that.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Egyptian pyramids as landing pads for alien spacecraft.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
I did not say that unequivocally. I simply put forth the
possibility, that based on the knowledge that--
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
It's all right, Doctor, you don't have to defend your theories here.
A month ago, a team of archaeologists from the University of Chicago
uncovered an ancient Egyptian tomb near Giza. Inside they found
artifacts typical of the period, plus one or two objects that have
yet to be identified, and a video camera.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(incredulous)
A video camera.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
(showing them a picture)
It was perfectly preserved in a vacuum sealed canopic jar. The
technology is somewhat different than what is commercially available
today, but we managed to charge the battery. However, we didn't
bring you here because we found the camera. We brought you here
because of what had been recorded on the tape inside that camera.
[Hammond activates the tape playback on the large projection screen.
The original team is on the recording, dressed in the robes they were
wearing in ancient Egypt. Daniel is not wearing his glasses.]
DANIEL
Okay, uh, my name is Doctor Daniel Jackson. I'm part of a team
called SG-1, and we have just traveled back in time 5000 years.
[Alternate Carter and Daniel look on, amazed.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is continuing to talk from the tape playback on the projection
screen.]
DANIEL
You see, the thing is, we're not sure we're gonna make it back. Um,
the chamber where you discover this tape should be discovered
shortly before we're set to leave. Hopefully the timeline hasn't
changed at all. Let's see, what are some recent major events. Uh,
communism recently failed in Eastern Europe. Um, they should be well
on their way towards democracy by now. Henry Hayes is President.
What else.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Henry Hayes?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Secretary of the Interior. President Kinsey was less than amused
when he saw that portion of the tape.
[Alternate Hammond continues the playback.]
DANIEL
Sam, help me out here.
(as Carter joins him in front of the camera)
Um, Samantha Carter, Lt. Colonel in the United States Air Force, and
a member of SG-1.
CARTER
What, uh, I suppose we should tell them about the Stargate.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(amazed to see herself)
Oh my god!
ALTERNATE DANIEL
What's SG-1?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Watch.
DANIEL
Right, um. Colonel Carter and I work for an organization known as
Stargate Command. It is located under Cheyenne Mountain. Now, for
the past eight years, we've been regularly traveling through a
large, ring-shaped device known as the Stargate. It should have been
discovered in 1928, somewhere near where this tape was found.
CARTER
Now, by means of these off-world missions, we've managed to aquire a
lot of advanced technology which has helped us defend Earth against
several alien attacks.
DANIEL
If for whatever reason, the things we're talking about are not true,
then it is possible that we have somehow inadvertently changed the
future. Now the purpose of this tape is to provide you with the
tools you will need to go back in time and set things right. If, for
whatever reason, the Stargate has not been discovered, you will have
to find it and get it up and running. Uh, Jack, you should say
something.
[Alternate Daniel and Carter are speechless with amazement.]
O'NEILL
(off-camera)
No, uh, I'm good.
DANIEL
We should all appear on the tape.
CARTER
We have no way of knowing how things could have changed.
[O'Neill steps in front of the camera.]
O'NEILL
Uh, General Jack O'Neill, United States Air Force. How ya doin'.
DANIEL
Tell them about the future.
O'NEILL
Uh, college football is played on Saturdays, pro on Sundays, and
there are no fish in my pond, at all, where I fish.
(looking back at Carter and Daniel)
I think that covers it.
[Alternate Hammond stops the video and looks expectantly at the other
two.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Did he say Stargate?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Time travel?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
What else did the tape say?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Details of the Stargate, SG-1, including a fourth member who appears
to be some kind of humanoid alien.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Are you telling us that in some alternate timeline, we're part of a
team that travels to other planets and defends Earth against alien
invasions?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
I know. It seems difficult to believe.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Wait, what about this Stargate. Did you look for it?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
We searched the coordinates provided on the tape, but we didn't find
anything. The area had already been excavated previously in 1934 by
a Doctor Langford. We found nothing but a tablet inscribed with
hieroglyphics that no one has ever been able to translate. We were
wondering if you'd like to take a crack at it.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Are you kidding?
INT--SGC COMMISARY
[Alternate Carter is seated alone, drinking from a mug, when Alternate
Daniel walks in.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Hey!
ALTERNATE CARTER
Hi.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(sitting down across from her)
So, what do you think of all this?
ALTERNATE CARTER
To be honest, I don't know what to think. I mean, it's pretty
overwhelming.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Time travel is theoretically possible. There's been a lot of
research into the area of quantum gravity, which suggests that time
flows like rotating fluid within our galaxy. Technically allowing
the traveler to journey backward and forward at will. But, there's a
huge amount of energy required.
[Daniel appears pained.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Actually, I was talking about us. The other us. I guess we could
call it the us we're supposed to be. I mean, seriously, didn't you
always think that you were destined for something more? I mean,
something a hell of a lot more fulfilling than a nine-to-five desk
job.
ALTERNATE CARTER
I suppose.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
I don't know. I just always felt like my life was wrong.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Well, life is what you make it. You know, for better or worse.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Well, look at this as a way to change everything. If we help them
find this Stargate.
ALTERNATE CARTER
What do you think they're gonna do? Ask us to join an elite team of
intergalactic space heroes? Look at us! The only reason that they
showed us the tape is because we're on it.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(pointing at her, enthusiastic)
Exactly.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Oh.
INT--SGC LAB
[Alternate Daniel is watching Daniel on the video tape on a computer
monitor. He has books, papers, and photographs scattered in front of
him.]
DANIEL
Okay, that about covers the gate dialling system, the point of
origin, the address of Chulak and the home address. What else? Ah
right. Um, okay, now this is very important.
(holding the ZPM up to the camera)
It's called a ZPM.
TEAL'C
(off-screen)
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
What?
TEAL'C
I believe the battery is about to expire.
DANIEL
(speaking very rapidly)
Okay, this is a very important-- This is called a Zero Point Module
and it's purpose is to--
[The image turns to static as Alternate Daniel looks on. Alternate
Hammond enters.]
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
How's that for timing?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Uh, this ZPM was recovered along with the tape?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Yes, we have a team of scientists studying it as we speak. How's the
translation coming?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Oh, ah. It's an obscure dialect. I can see why your experts had
trouble.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
But?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
But it's almost as if the person who chiselled this tablet knew my
research. See, in 2995 B.C., about five years after the team on this
tape arrived in the past, there was an uprising. The ancient
Egyptians rebelled against the Sun God Ra, or at least someone they
believed to be an imposter. Now apparently, whoever this imposter
was, he left in a great flying ship and took the Stargate with him.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
That is unfortunate.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah, but the tablet makes reference to a location where there might
be a second Stargate here on Earth.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Where?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(not quite meeting his eye)
Uh, I'm still working on that.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Thank you, Doctor. I look forward to your report.
[Hammond turns to leave.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Uh, General? If it's all right with you, I'd like to join the
expedition to find the second gate.
[Alternate Hammond looks at him dubiously.]
INT--SGC COMMISARY
[Alternate Carter is eating blue jello when Alternate Daniel rushes in
and sits across from her.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(agitated)
You were right. They're gonna shut us out.
[He sits back in his chair and crosses his arms over his chest.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
I can't say I'm surprised.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
I still haven't finished the entire translation yet, which means we
still have some leverage.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(quietly)
What else does it say?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(quietly)
It says the second Stargate is somewhere in Antarctica.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Somewhere in Antarctica?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Well, it doesn't even say that. It says the land of the cold to the
south. Which I'm guessing means Antarctica.
ALTERNATE CARTER
It's a big place. Lots of ice.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah, I'm guessing whoever wrote the tablet didn't have a way of
explaining latitude and longitude in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Well at least you're still useful to them. I don't know why they're
keeping me around.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Well, I'm not gonna let them shut you out, either. I mean, we're
supposed to be a team. We have to stick together.
ALTERNATE CARTER
That's nice. Really.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah. We need someone who's willing to go to bat for us. Someone
they can't say no to.
EXT--A BOATING DOCK, DAY
[Alternate O'Neill is working on the engine of his boat, apparently
without much success.]
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Ow! Damn!
[Alternate Carter and Alternate Daniel walk up to the boat and watch
him from the dock until he notices them.]
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
You folks lookin' for a little tour?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Jack O'Neill?
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
(warily)
Yeah.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Uh, I'm Daniel Jackson; this is Samantha Carter.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
(looking them over)
You two a couple?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
No, no, no, we just, we just met.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
What do you want?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Well uh, we were recently approached by the military about a matter
of, um, national security.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
(continuing to work on the engine)
Don't care.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
This is really important. All we're asking is a little bit of your
time.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
A hundred and fifty bucks an hour to rent the boat.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
We don't wanna go anywhere.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
It's your money.
EXT--ABOARD THE HOMER, DAY
[The boat is still sitting in the dock. Alternate O'Neill is still
working on it, while Alternate Carter and Daniel sit beside each other
on a bench, wearing orange life jackets.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
So ultimately what we have to do is this. We have to find the
Stargate and then get hold of this time travel device.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Locate this alien named Teal'c.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Right, get Teal'c first, then go back in time to change the past,
fix the future.
[O'Neill is working on a fishing pole, not appearing to listen.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Are you listening?
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
I was trying not to.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah, I suppose it does sound a little crazy.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Really? Which part? I'd have to say, the moment I let you on board.
ALTERNATE CARTER
You don't have to believe us. All we ask is that you watch the tape
and decide for yourself.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
You know, I have decided. And hey look, your time's up!
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(emphatic)
Aren't you in the least bit intrigued that there might be something
else out there, somewhere? Something more than this!
[O'Neill stares at them for a moment.]
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
No.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
We're supposed to be a team. We saved the world.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Several times.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
(in a heavy Minnesotan accent)
Yeah. Okay. Sure. I'll buy that. Uh huh. The three of us. The world,
we save it, right? Okay.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(to Alternate Daniel)
I can't believe I wasted my frequent flyer miles on this.
[Alternate O'Neill gives them a sarcastic 'okay' symbol with his hand.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Sorry to bother you.
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
Not a problem.
[They stand to leave. Alternate O'Neill gestures for them not to remove
their life jackets until they step back onto the dock. They clumsily
and angrily remove them, throwing them back into the boat.]
ALTERNATE O'NEILL
No worries, eh?
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[An airman is escorting Alternate Carter and Daniel.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
Do you have any idea what's going on?
[Alternate Daniel shakes his head. They turn a corner to find Alternate
Davis waiting.]
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Doctor Carter, Doctor Jackson.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Major, what's this about?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Did you find the second Stargate?
ALTERNATE DAVIS
No, we didn't. But we decided to show you something else.
[He turns to the men guarding the door.]
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Airmen?
[The airman opens the door, revealing the Puddle Jumper sitting in a
large room.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Whoa.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
We think this was the ship SG-1 used to travel back in time.
ALTERNATE CARTER
(walking up to its side and touching it)
Where'd you find it?
ALTERNATE DAVIS
It was uncovered during an excavation of the area around the tomb
where the tape was found.
(gesturing for them to continue)
Please.
[The enter the ship from the rear ramp.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
This is incredible. Is it operational?
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Not yet.
ALTERNATE CARTER
According to the tape, Jack O'Neill has a special gene that makes
him able to fly this thing.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
These are constellations.
ALTERNATE CARTER
The tape said that the, that this was able to go through the
Stargate, as well as time travel.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(seeing the control panel between the pilots' seats)
So this must be what dials the gate.
[Alternate Daniel and Carter reach for the console. There is a booming
voice from behind them.]
ALTERNATE MCKAY
Don't touch anything! Please. Leave the touching to the experts.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Doctor Rodney McKay is the lead scientist on the project. This is
Doctor Carter, Doctor Jackson.
[Alternate McKay is wearing a Mr. Fantasy tee-shirt. Alternate Carter
and Daniel reach their hands out to shake hands, but he only takes
Alternate Carter's.]
ALTERNATE MCKAY
Hi. Pleased to meet you.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
We were hoping they may be of assistance to you.
ALTERNATE MCKAY
Hmm, yes, well, thank you.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
I'll leave you to it, then.
[Alternate Davis leaves as Alternate McKay gives long looks to
Alternate Carter and Alternate Daniel.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
So, did you try dialling the Stargate address that the Daniel
Jackson on the tape mentions?
ALTERNATE MCKAY
No, why would we do that?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Well, just to see--
ALTERNATE MCKAY
Of course we tried. It's called sarcasm. We tried the address
numerous times; nothing happened.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Did you try any other combinations?
ALTERNATE MCKAY
I'm sorry. What are your areas of expertise?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Astrophysics.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Archaeology.
ALTERNATE MCKAY
(to Alternate Daniel)
And I would listen to you, because...?
ALTERNATE CARTER
We're on the tape.
ALTERNATE MCKAY
No you, you I would listen to if you were reading a phone book.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Oh, brother.
ALTERNATE MCKAY
You see, I love this whole, sexy librarian thing? Look, why don't I
take you to lunch and get you up to speed. I hear it's Lemon Chicken
today, my favorite, hmmm?
[He gestures for her to go with him and pats her on the bottom as they
leave. Alternate Daniel is disgusted by his behavior.]
ALTERNATE MCKAY
A lot to talk about.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Alternate Carter is walking down the hallway and sees Alternate Daniel
ahead of her.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
Daniel!
[Daniel turns to face her.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
Is he behind me?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Who?
ALTERNATE CARTER
McKay.
[Alternate Daniel shakes his head.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
Oh, thank god. I think I lost him. The guy is driving me nuts!
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Any progress with the ship?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Well, the technology is way beyond us, but I do have something. It
could be big.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
What?
ALTERNATE CARTER
Remember how McKay said they tried dialling the Stargate address
several times and nothing happened?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Yeah.
ALTERNATE CARTER
I started thinking. Nothing happened here.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Alternate Carter and Alternate Daniel are seated at the table.
Alternate Davis enters.]
ALTERNATE DAVIS
What have you got?
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(primly)
We're waiting to see General Hammond.
ALTERNATE DAVIS
He's busy. Why don't you tell me; I'll decide if it's worth
interrupting him.
[Alternate Daniel passes a file to Alternate Carter, who passes it to
Alternate Davis.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
I cross referenced our previous attempts to dial the gate with some
recent seismic activity in Antarctica. They're a perfect match. The
epicenter in all eight cases was exactly the same. Approximately 50
miles outside of McMurdo.
(pointing to a location on the map)
That is where you'll find your second gate.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
Worth it?
ALTERNATE DAVIS
Excuse me.
[He picks up the folder and leaves. Alternate Carter and Alternate
Daniel look smugly pleased.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Alternate Carter and Alternate Daniel enter to see a buzz of activity
and construction. They approach Hammond.]
ALTERNATE CARTER
General, you wanted to see us?
[They look up to see the gate being lowered into the room from an open
ceiling far above.]
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
It was exactly where you said it would be. Good work.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Thank you, sir.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
I want you both to know that your help on this project was most
appreciated. Your country owes you a debt of gratitude.
[They look at Hammond, concerned.]
ALTERNATE DANIEL
But we're not done yet.
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
Actually, we're not done. You two, however, have a plane waiting to
take you home. I'm sure I don't need to remind you of the details of
the non-disclosure agreement.
ALTERNATE CARTER
Wait a minute. You are gonna send a team through the gate, aren't
you?
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
We're assembling a team as we speak.
ALTERNATE DANIEL
(indignant)
But you saw the tape! We are that team. I mean, if anybody should be
going, it's us!
ALTERNATE HAMMOND
I'm sorry Doctor Jackson, but neither you nor Doctor Carter possess
the training or qualifications for a mission like this. That's just
the way it is.
[Hammond leaves as Alternate Carter and Alternate Daniel watch the gate
being lowered into place.]
