EXT--P3X-984--ALPHA SITE--SANDY AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
[People are shouting, SGC personnel are guarding the Gate and rebel
Jaffa are running around chaotically helping Tok'ra refugees coming
through the Gate]
FRAISER
Immobilise with a cervical collar and let the symbiote heal the
damage.
[Artok, wearing the tattoo of Heru'ur, and another Jaffa are running
with a stretcher towards the Gate.]
FRAISER
Pressure dressing, stat. Airway's compromised. Corpsman, priority
one. Let's move!
[O'Neill and Carter are standing by watching the Gate as wounded Tok'ra
come through. Ocker and another Tok'ra carrying a large box come
through the Gate. Artok approaches and steps close to the box. Ocker
twists his arm and pushes him away. Teal'c, Rak'nor and some other
Jaffa surround Ocker and point their staff weapons at him.]
O'NEILL
Hey! Hey!
[Bra'tac holds back Artok]
O'NEILL
What's that?
OCKER
We were told we could bring equipment essential to our security.
O'NEILL
That wasn't the question. Open it up.
[Ocker opens the box and reveals a Zatarc detector.]
TEAL'C
A Zatarc detector.
O'NEILL
See, that's all you had to say. Move out.
[Ocker and another Tok'ra lift the box and carry it away. More SGC
personnel come through the Gate followed by more Tok'ra. O'Neill turns
toward Pierce.]
O'NEILL
Pierce?
PIERCE
Colonel. SG-12 was wiped out in the first wave, sir. The Goa'uld
knew exactly where to hit. They took us completely by surprise.
CARTER
Where's my father?
PIERCE
He insisted on disabling the DHD at the Tok'ra base and ordered us
to leave.
[Carter and O'Neill look concerned]
O'NEILL
See to your men.
[Pierce walks away. Jacob/Selmak steps through the Gate together with
the Tok'ra Malek. A staff weapon blast comes shooting out of the Gate
and hits Jacob in the leg just before the Stargate deactivates. Malek
supports Jacob. Carter rushes towards her father and helps him down the
steps in front of the Gate.]
O'NEILL
Is the Gate secure?
BRA'TAC
If the Chaapa'ai is soon reactivated, we will have the answer.
JACOB
I set a charge equivalent to a tactical nuke to detonate ten seconds
after we left. No one's following us. No one saw the address.
O'NEILL
You're sure about that?
JACOB
I'm positive.
O'NEILL
(turning to the SGC personnel)
Stand down. Help the wounded.
(to Jacob)
What happened?
MALEK
Anubis's forces overran our position in the Risa system.
JACOB
We tried dialling the SGC Gate, but the Gate must have already been
active.
CARTER
Jonas and SG-2 were returning from P36-231 with artefacts they'd
gathered.
JACOB
Jack, I know you wanted to keep the location of the Alpha site
top-secret, but we had no alternative. We couldn't wait.
O'NEILL
You dialled the coordinates yourself, right?
JACOB
Yeah. I was careful. Nobody saw.
MALEK
To whom do I owe thanks for this refuge?
JACOB
Colonel Jack O'Neill, this is Malek, commander of the Tok'ra base we
just evacuated. And Ocker, chief of security.
MALEK
Your people were most brave in aiding us.
O'NEILL
How many made it?
OCKER
Less than a quarter of our number.
O'NEILL
I'm sorry.
MALEK
This is the base of the Tauri. Why are there Jaffa?
CARTER
Rebel warriors.
MALEK
Jaffa who have turned against the Goa'uld. I did not realise their
ranks had grown to such a number.
CARTER
Hundreds more are operating as a fifth column among the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Just like you.
[Malek looks sceptical]
CARTER
Many of these rebel Jaffa had to evacuate their rebel base several
months ago.
OCKER
I see.
O'NEILL
Is that going to be a problem?
MALEK
Not for us.
O'NEILL
Good.
CARTER
(concerned)
Dad.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ALPHA SITE--SANDY AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
[A Tok'ra funeral is taking place. SGC personnel, Jaffa and Tok'ra are
gathered around the Stargate; three Tok'ra bodies lie on a makeshift
wooden scaffolding in front of the Gate.]
MALEK
Arik tre-ac te kek.
TEAL'C
(translating quietly for O'Neill)
We do not surrender, even in death.
JACOB
Tak mal arik tiak.
TEAL'C
You will not be forgotten.
[Malek signals to Ocker, who activates the Stargate. As the event
horizon establishes, the wormhole lurches out and disintegrates the
scaffolding with the bodies. The group of humans, Jaffa and Tok'ra
breaks up. Soon after couple of Jaffa and Tok'ra start shouting at each
other. O'Neill and Teal'c turn towards the voices. Artok is lying on
the ground.]
OCKER
(Walking towards Artok)
Nemeth kree!
O'NEILL
Hey. Hey! What the hell is goin' on? This is a funeral, for cryin'
out loud!
ARTOK
I asked a question of this Tok'ra.
OCKER
No one may speak during the ritual.
O'NEILL
For this, you guys are fighting?! I'm sure he's sorry.
ARTOK
I am not.
O'NEILL
On the inside.
OCKER
It does not matter.
O'NEILL
Look, it does not matter. Come on, a lot of people lost their lives.
Show a little respect.
[Ocker turns and starts to walk away.]
ARTOK
They are no different than the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
Jaffa.
[Artok walks away angrily]
O'NEILL
All right, break it up! Go on home. There's nothin' to see here. Go
on.
MALEK
There's no need to apologise on their behalf, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Apologise?
MALEK
We understand the Jaffa.
O'NEILL
Actually, I was gonna remind you that without Bra'tac and Teal'c and
other Jaffa, all your little Tok'ra folks would be pushin' up
daisies right now.
MALEK
And I need not remind you that the rebel Jaffa and the Tauri are
equally indebted to us.
[O'Neill and Teal'c look surprised.]
TEAL'C
How so?
MALEK
We have been fighting the Goa'uld for millennia.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Just when should we expect some progress on that?
[Malek looks insulted.]
O'NEILL
It's been a bad day. Let's...move on.
[Malek walks away. Carter approaches.]
CARTER
Sir. Several of the Tok'ra have expressed concern about the
temporary quarters they've been assigned.
O'NEILL
Explain to them the meaning of the word "temporary". If they don't
like it, they can leave.
CARTER
You really want me to tell them that?
O'NEILL
Yes. No.
(sighs)
I'll do it.
[Jacob is sitting on a crate watching Jaffa training. O'Neill walks
toward him.]
O'NEILL
Hey. How's the leg?
JACOB
It's better. One of the perks of being a Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
(sitting down beside Jacob)
If you say so. What was all that crap at the funeral?
JACOB
I wouldn't read too much into it.
O'NEILL
Why do you guys have to be so dang...
JACOB
Arrogant?
O'NEILL
Yeah, okay.
JACOB
It's complicated, symbiote and host. The blending of two
personalities does sometimes have its drawbacks.
O'NEILL
Tell me about it.
JACOB
Jack, there's no denying you had a bad experience. But if you hadn't
had a symbiote implanted...
O'NEILL
Ah! Please, don't use that term, huh?
JACOB
If you hadn't been blended with Kanan, you'd be dead right now. By
the way, if I hadn't become a Tok'ra, I'd be dead too. Kanan broke
one of our highest laws. He used you. I can tell you that even
Selmak was sickened by it and there's no way he could have hidden
those feelings from me. But Kanan did something terribly wrong while
trying to do the right thing. You can't forgive him for that?
O'NEILL
No.
JACOB
It's a shame a true blending never really occurred. You might be
able to understand the Tok'ra a little better.
O'NEILL
Oh, I think I understand 'em just fine.
JACOB
You don't like us much any more, do you?
O'NEILL
I like you.
JACOB
I see the Jaffa differently. Most of the Tok'ra hosts come from
worlds conquered by the Goa'uld, born into a feudal system where
their only choices were forced labour or death.
O'NEILL
So it's the host's fault?
JACOB
It's history. For 2,000 years, every time a Tok'ra died at the end
of a staff weapon, a Jaffa was holding it. We just got our asses
kicked by an army of Jaffa loyal to Anubis. You think that helps?
O'NEILL
No.
JACOB
There's talk among the Tok'ra ranks that the end is closer than we
think. And I don't mean the end of the Goa'uld. I mean the end of
us. All of us. The Jaffa rebellion isn't exactly rolling along as
well as could be expected either, I take it.
O'NEILL
No. It's not.
JACOB
Then at least we have that much in common.
EXT--SUNRISE--NEXT DAY
INT--SCIENCE LAB
CARTER
(walking around a naquadah reactor sitting on a table)
It seemed like a power fluctuation in the cycle output of the
naquadah reactor. But at closer inspection, I discovered the
absorption port and its redundancy had been tampered with.
O'NEILL
Carter! I haven't had coffee.
CARTER
Sir, no one would have noticed it if they didn't know what to look
for; the reactor would have overloaded.
O'NEILL
Any chance this was an accident?
CARTER
Not a chance.
TEAL'C
Would not such an explosion destroy an area several miles in
circumference?
CARTER
Yeah, it would.
O'NEILL
Who knows about this?
CARTER
Except for the guards I posted, just us.
TEAL'C
How long would it have taken for an overload to result in an
explosion?
CARTER
An hour. Maybe less.
O'NEILL
(sighs and takes out his radio)
Pierce? O'Neill. No one goes within 20 yards of the Gate till I get
there.
PIERCE
(into radio)
Yes, sir.
TEAL'C
What are you considering, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Well, if you'd rigged you reactor to blow...wouldn't you want to be
offworld before it...blew?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
EXT--ALPHA SITE--AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
[Hammond and Jonas are standing in the Gate control room looking at a
monitor with MALP video telemetry of SG-1 on it]
HAMMOND
(talking to O'Neill over the MALP radio)
I could send reinforcements.
O'NEILL
Negative, sir. We've got enough people here as it is.
JONAS
Colonel, at least let me rejoin the team. An incoming wormhole from
Earth--what risk could there be?
O'NEILL
Sorry Jonas, you're gonna have to sit this one out. In fact, until
we know what's going on, General, I recommend no Gate travel either
way.
HAMMOND
Understood, Colonel. I'll have SG-3 standing by, just in case.
O'NEILL
We'll report back in 24 hours. O'Neill out.
[The Stargate shuts down]
O'NEILL
Pierce, I want the guard doubled.
PIERCE
Yes, sir.
[Malek and several other Tok'ra approach]
MALEK
What is happening?
O'NEILL
Uh, looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while.
MALEK
It is imperative that we be allowed to seek another location for our
base.
O'NEILL
Yeah, you might want to put that on hold. We have a situation.
TEAL'C
There is a saboteur among us.
CARTER
Our naquadah reactor almost went critical. I discovered it just in
time.
MALEK
And if you hadn't?
O'NEILL
Then we wouldn't be having this chat.
MALEK
I see.
CARTER
This planet was chosen as our Alpha site because its address is
unknown to the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
And it is imperative that this base remain secret. We will be
questioning everybody.
MALEK
Of course.
O'NEILL
Starting with the Tok'ra.
[The Tok'ra look disturbed]
MALEK
For what reason?
O'NEILL
Everything was fine until you showed up.
MALEK
If what you say is true, we would have perished with you.
O'NEILL
It'd only take one.
MALEK
Selmak?
SELMAK
We have no choice. The Zatarc detector will reveal any lie or
deception.
CARTER
Yeah, but a spy within either the Jaffa or Tok'ra ranks wouldn't
necessarily have to be a Zatarc to attempt this.
SELMAK
Any deception will be detected, whether we are dealing with a Zatarc
or not.
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM
[Malek sits with a Zatarc probing device on his temple looking at the
detector. Jacob/Selmak is standing looking at the monitor of the
detector, which remains unchanged]
MALEK
That is when I requested to leave and you informed me of the
sabotage.
JACOB
Do you know why the Tok'ra base fell?
MALEK
Exactly how Anubis was able to defeat our defence system remains a
mystery.
JACOB
Okay, we're done.
[Malek stands and Jacob removes the small device from his temple]
MALEK
Thank you.
O'NEILL
No. Thank you.
[Malek leaves the room. O'Neill looks outside through the window and
sees Artok and Ocker almost getting into another fight. Teal'c holds
back Artok.]
JACOB
I'll screen the wounded, but I doubt they could have made it from
the infirmary undetected. After that, if we still have nothing, base
personnel will have to be screened.
O'NEILL
(turning to look at Jacob)
Okay.
JACOB
And the Jaffa.
O'NEILL
Bra'tac?
BRA'TAC
I had hoped it would not come to that.
O'NEILL
Look, if the Jaffa won't submit to the screening after the Tok'ra
already have, we're just askin' for trouble.
BRA'TAC
The very purpose of this device questions one's honour.
JACOB
Or you could say it confirms one's honour.
BRA'TAC
It is also of Tok'ra design.
O'NEILL
Oh, come on!
BRA'TAC
I have learned much in my 137 years. Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you trust the Tok'ra entirely?
O'NEILL
No. Not entirely. But enough to allow myself to be screened along
with everybody else.
BRA'TAC
(bowing his head slightly)
I will convince the Jaffa to submit. You have my word. Perhaps once
the Tok'ra see how big Jaffa hearts can be, they will finally look
upon us as equals.
[O'Neill, Bra'tac and Jacob hear shouting coming from outside the
building]
MALEK
Colonel O'Neill!
EXT--COMPOUND, DAY
[O'Neill, Bra'tac and Jacob run outside towards Malek, who is standing
behind some crates and barrels. As they approach, they see the dead
body of Ocker lying on the ground behind the barrels.]
[Fraiser and Carter are inspecting Ocker's dead body. Artok is led to
Ocker's dead body by two Tok'ra]
MALEK
You killed Ocker.
ARTOK
I would have, if he'd challenged me again.
MALEK
Are you not responsible for this?
ARTOK
I only wish I was.
BRA'TAC
Answer him directly.
ARTOK
I will not explain myself to him.
O'NEILL
Then explain it to me.
[Artok and Malek look at each other aggressively]
O'NEILL
Please.
ARTOK
I was across the compound.
MALEK
I insist that he be screened immediately.
[The tension between Tok'ra and Jaffa is visibly mounting]
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[An SG guard and a Tok'ra approach Artok, who turns around defiantly.]
ARTOK
I will not! I will not!
[Bra'tac holds back the Tok'ra approaching Artok and turns around to
face him. They look at each other meaningfully. Artok then bows his
head and walks away quietly, followed by SG guards.]
O'NEILL
Carter, I want you in there.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
(to Fraiser who sits by Ocker's body)
I need to know the cause of death.
FRAISER
I'll get on it, sir.
O'NEILL
(turning around to face Bra'tac and Jacob)
You both know this, but I'm gonna say it out loud anyway. I need
every bit of influence you two have, or this whole thing's gonna
blow up.
[Bra'tac and Jacob both nod in agreement]
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM
[Artok is sitting in front of the Zatarc detector and Jacob is asking
questions while O'Neill, Teal'c, Malek and some guards are standing
by.]
ARTOK
I was alone outside the compound, eating my ration in private.
JACOB
Do you know who killed Ocker?
ARTOK
No.
[The monitor on the Zatarc detector remains blue.]
JACOB
Did you kill him?
ARTOK
No, I did not kill him.
[The monitor on the Zatarc detector now turns red, indicating a lie or
deception.]
JACOB
We're finished.
O'NEILL
Holding cell.
SG GUARD
Yes, sir.
ARTOK
Master Bra'tac, I did not kill him.
BRA'TAC
Go with them.
(removing the device on Artok's temple)
Do not attempt escape.
[Artok is taken to a holding cell by SG guards]
MALEK
Deception. He is guilty.
O'NEILL
All we know is that he is lying about something.
MALEK
What more proof do you need?
CARTER
This device is not infallible. It can give false positives. We've
seen it before.
MALEK
A short while ago, you were all willing to stake the security of the
base on it.
CARTER
Artok's obvious hostility towards the Tok'ra could be throwing off
the readings.
MALEK
His hostility is the reason Ocker is dead.
O'NEILL
What if we verify his alibi?
CARTER
Colonel's right. Maybe someone saw him where he said he was.
TEAL'C
Tok'ra and Jaffa deliberately ate apart from each other.
MALEK
I will not accept the word of a Jaffa in his defence.
O'NEILL
Of course you won't. So, why don't we see what the autopsy says?
MALEK
Why?
O'NEILL
Because we don't convict people just because some damn light turns
red!
MALEK
How long will the autopsy take?
CARTER
It's hard to say.
JACOB
The report may offer tangible evidence proving or disproving his
guilt.
O'NEILL
Look, he's not goin' anywhere. You've got my word.
BRA'TAC
And mine as well.
MALEK
(apparently having some sort of internal struggle)
Many Tok'ra have died in recent days. To lose another of our number
in a place we had thought was refuge, it is difficult.
O'NEILL
I'm sure it is.
INT--AUTOPSY ROOM
[Teal'c, Bra'tac, Carter, O'Neill and Malek stand listening to Fraiser]
FRAISER
There is some bruising around the right side of his mouth, which
could be a sign that the killer prevented him from calling out by
covering his mouth with his left hand from behind. The trauma to the
back of the neck was done with a bladed weapon of fairly exotic
design. The blade was used to sever the spinal column of the host
between the first and second cervical vertebrae, while
simultaneously severing the spinal column of the symbiote between
the 33rd and 34th precloacal vertebrae.
JACOB
Death would have been instantaneous.
BRA'TAC
No Jaffa did this.
CARTER
How do you know?
TEAL'C
Jaffa do not kill in this fashion.
MALEK
Are you suggesting that a Jaffa could not be trained to do this?
BRA'TAC
I am telling you that a Jaffa would not. Vengeance is exacted face
to face, not from behind.
MALEK
Face to face, a Jaffa may not survive.
TEAL'C
It is a Tok'ra or a Goa'uld who has committed this act.
MALEK
I disagree.
[An alarm starts to sound. Everyone runs outside and into the cellblock
where the alarm is coming from. Artok is lying dead on the floor of his
closed holding cell about three feet away from the bars.]
EXT--CELLBLOCK, DAY
INT--HOLDING CELL
[Fraiser and Carter are examining Artok's body]
FRAISER
This is different. This was a frontal attack. The only similar thing
is that it was done by a bladed weapon.
CARTER
The same one?
FRAISER
Could be. Won't know for sure until I inspect the trauma to the
internal organs.
O'NEILL
Was the door locked, Sergeant?
SERGEANT
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
Did you hear anything?
SERGEANT
No, sir.
CARTER
It's pretty unlikely that someone defeated the lock on the cell
door, stabbed with him without a fight, and then relocked the door
as they left. What if they attacked through the bars and the force
of the blow pushed him back to where he is now?
FRAISER
It was a frontal attack. So why are there no defensive wounds?
O'NEILL
He'd have to be standing in front of the bars.
TEAL'C
A Jaffa would never expose himself to such a vulnerable position.
MALEK
Unless he knew his killer...and did not fear him.
EXT--AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
[Artok's body is carried outside on a stretcher by two SGC guards.]
RAK'NOR
Artok is dead! Only yesterday he helped to carry your wounded, and
then you killed him!
TEAL'C
Now is not the time.
RAK'NOR
You know the truth.
TEAL'C
I do not.
MALEK
A Tok'ra did not kill him. Of this I am certain.
(looking at the blade on Rak'nors belt)
You carry a blade on your belt.
RAK'NOR
To defend myself, when the Tok'ra finally come for me.
[Malek starts to walk past Rak'nor.]
RAK'NOR
(grabbing Malek's left arm)
He was defenceless!
[Malek lashes out with the back of his left hand and squarely hits
Rak'nor in the face. Jaffa and Tok'ra immediately line up in rows and
point their weapons at the opposite side.]
JACOB
Malek!
O'NEILL
Somebody wanna...tell me what's goin' on here?
[No one answers; instead Jaffa and Tok'ra glare aggressively at each
other with weapons ready]
O'NEILL
Anybody? Why don't we put the weapons...down?
BRA'TAC
Teal'c! O'Neill!
O'NEILL
Should we go check this out, let these folks talk among themselves?
[Teal'c and O'Neill turn and walk to meet Bra'tac who is standing a
short distance away]
BRA'TAC
Footprints. Recently made, and alone. Whoever did this fled quickly
in that direction.
MALEK
The footprints...Jaffa or Tok'ra?
BRA'TAC
They could be either one.
[The rows of Tok'ra and Jaffa slowly put their weapons back down.]
O'NEILL
All right, let's do a head count.
[Everyone in the compound has gathered on a small hill some distance
away from the Stargate]
O'NEILL
All right, listen up, folks. The good news is, we can stop pointing
fingers at each other. Everyone's been accounted for. However, that
does mean that someone or, dare I say it, some thing is still
floatin' around, tryin' to do us in.
BRA'TAC
We will search in groups of three, a Tok'ra, Jaffa and Tauri in
each.
O'NEILL
This thing was trying to turn us against each other. The fact that
we're onto him makes him more dangerous. Keep that in mind. Let's
move out.
EXT--WOODS AROUND COMPOUND, DAY
[Everyone moves in teams into the woods around the compound. The team
made up of Teal'c, Pierce and a Tok'ra soon come across another team of
three. The Jaffa, Tok'ra and Grier are lying dead on the forest floor
near a tree.]
TEAL'C
(into radio)
O'Neill?
O'NEILL
(stops his team and speaks into radio)
Go ahead, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
We have located Captain Grier's search team. They are dead.
O'NEILL
Any tracks?
TEAL'C
Each team member appears to have been killed separately and dragged
to this location.
O'NEILL
Okay. What's your position?
TEAL'C
East of the creek near the base of the north cliff.
[Near O'Neill, a twig snaps and branches are moved by an invisible
Ashrak]
O'NEILL
Stand by, I got something here.
[Teal'c, O'Neill and Bra'tac look at each other, pondering their next
course of action]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Carter, hook up with Teal'c at his position. Secure the area.
CARTER
(into her radio)
Yes, sir.
[Carter gives Jacob and Rak'nor directions with her hand and they get
moving. O'Neill gives hand directions to Bra'tac and Malek and they
move off as well. As they walk amidst the trees, the Ashrak looks down
upon them from a branch up in a tree. He has a blurry, distorted, pale
blue view because of the visor attached to his helmet. Malek and
Bra'tac stop just below the Ashrak, who then jumps down from his
branch. Bra'tac senses him coming and pushes Malek out of the way.
Bra'tac fires his staff weapon but misses the Ashrak, who then attacks
him. Bra'tac swings around his staff weapon in vain and fires five
blasts in total. Malek also tries to zat the Ashrak but fails. Bra'tac
is knocked to the ground. He pulls his knife but the Ashrak knocks it
out of his hand. Then he is knocked around some more until he is
finally dragged off into the bushes. Malek is left behind and does not
attempt to follow. Instead, he runs off back into the woods until he is
stopped by O'Neill who is standing behind a tree.]
O'NEILL
Shhh! What happened?
MALEK
I could not defend against it. I had no choice.
O'NEILL
Where's Bra'tac?
MALEK
He is dead.
[Suddenly Malek is lying on the ground with Teal'c's hands around his
throat.]
TEAL'C
Tell me why I should not kill you here, Tok'ra.
MALEK
(speaking with an effort)
He was swept away. There was nothing I could have done.
TEAL'C
You could have pursued him! Master Bra'tac could have been saved.
MALEK
I believed it more important to report what I saw.
RAK'NOR
How can we ever trust the Tok'ra if they would abandon a Jaffa in
the midst of a battle?
MALEK
(speaking with a muffled voice)
If I had not, I would be dead.
[O'Neill waves away a fly.]
JACOB
Jack. A little help.
O'NEILL
(without much conviction)
Teal'c. Stop.
[Malek makes choking sounds. Jacob looks at O'Neill, who is obviously
not feeling like stepping in, and walks to Teal'c]
JACOB
Teal'c, don't do this. Bra'tac would want us to stick together.
O'NEILL
(sighs)
He's right, Teal'c.
[Teal'c looks at O'Neill and after a pause releases Malek, who then
gasps for air and starts to cough.]
MALEK
Bra'tac pushed me out of the way just before the attack. Somehow, he
knew whoever it was had a personal cloaking device. He was
invisible.
RAK'NOR
Invisible?
[Jacob helps Malek up]
CARTER
Nirrti possesses stealth technology. She could've come through the
Gate with the Tok'ra undetected. That would explain why there were
no defensive wounds and how Anubis was able to defeat the defences
of the Tok'ra base. An invisible spy could operate with impunity.
O'NEILL
That woman continues to get on my nerves.
JACOB
I doubt Nirrti would be in league with Anubis. She's a renegade.
CARTER
Well, whoever it is, we're dealing with an enemy we can't see.
Without TERs to counter that technology, we're helpless.
MALEK
Do you have the means to generate a high-frequency electromagnetic
field?
CARTER
I could modify the wave output of the naquadah reactor.
MALEK
Within a range of 400 to 700 nanometres?
CARTER
(excited)
That might just excite the phase particles enough to bring them into
our visible light spectrum.
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Sir, the invisibility field must operate...
O'NEILL
Are you about to tell me that you can make the invisible guy vi...?
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
That's all I need.
JACOB
If you can see it, you can shoot it.
O'NEILL
Right.
MALEK
I will assist you.
O'NEILL
Fine. Let's move out.
[Teal'c looks at Malek in an extremely unfriendly way]
EXT--AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
CARTER
We need to bring the reactor out in the open.
O'NEILL
Do it. I want everybody else guarding the Gate.
(to all of the Tok'ra, Jaffa and SGC personnel)
All right, listen up! Our enemy has a device that can render
himself, or herself, invisible. He or she may have come through the
Gate with the wounded Tok'ra.
JACOB
Whatever it is, it tried to play us against each other. And that's
not gonna work any more, because now we know it is among us.
TEAL'C
Bra'tac is gone. His death will have been in vain unless we trust
each other, and work together to defeat this enemy.
O'NEILL
Do what you have to do, but that son of a bitch does not get through
that Gate.
PIERCE
Yes, sir.
TEAL'C
If this creature is allowed to leave, this base will have to be
abandoned.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I know.
[Teal'c and O'Neill hear an engine. They turn around and see a small
remote controlled vehicle approach with the naquadah reactor mounted on
it. Carter is controlling the vehicle.]
INT--AUTOPSY ROOM
FRAISER
It checks out. The same bladed weapon killed both of them. Probably
the others too. A single thrust, up through the symbiote, continuing
up, piercing the Jaffa's heart. He was dead before he hit the
ground.
O'NEILL
Nirrti's been working out.
TEAL'C
Not Nirrti, an Ashrak. A highly trained Goa'uld assassin of great
strength and power, most likely in the service of Anubis.
FRAISER
Wasn't it an Ashrak who was able to penetrate SGC security and try
to kill Major Carter?
TEAL'C
Indeed. The Ashrak succeeded in killing Jolinar, to whom Major
Carter was host.
O'NEILL
That guy wasn't invisible.
TEAL'C
While in the service of Apophis, many Jaffa were killed in the
manner Dr. Fraiser has described while working in the naquadah mines
of Kawawn. Apophis ordered the mines sealed, and when the tunnels
were opened days later, only a single Ashrak was found. Only one had
killed so many.
FRAISER
Well, if he's that powerful, why didn't he just go on a killing
spree?
O'NEILL
Divide and conquer.
EXT--AREA NEAR STARGATE, DAY
[Carter and Malek are working near the Stargate on the naquadah reactor
while the rest is keeping watch]
RAK'NOR
I wish that Bra'tac were here.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I know. Carter? Are you there yet?
CARTER
Almost, sir. The reactor wasn't designed for a sustained output at
this frequency range.
[The invisible Ashrak approaches the area around the Stargate,
remaining undetected. He moves between the Jaffa, Tok'ra and SGC
personnel guarding the Gate. He moves close to Pierce and hits him.
Pierce falls and the Ashrak moves on to slam a Tok'ra out of his way.
He then hits two Jaffa while going in a straight line towards the Gate.
He manages to immobilise every one standing between him and the Gate. A
Jaffa accidentally shoots a Tok'ra with his staff weapon. The Ashrak
now moves away from the Gate and hits Teal'c in the face. He runs off
as everyone is shooting around trying to hit him.]
O'NEILL
Medics, we've got wounded out here, go to work!
(to Teal'c)
You okay?
PIERCE
Colonel. I'm sorry, sir. Somehow it got my GDO during the firefight.
O'NEILL
What?!
PIERCE
It was moving in and around us, sir. At least one casualty was hit
by friendly fire.
O'NEILL
All right. Re-establish a perimeter around the Gate.
PIERCE
I'd like to take a team after it, sir.
O'NEILL
Negative. That's what it wants. You hold that Gate, make sure
everyone has a clear line of fire. Go.
PIERCE
Yes, sir.
MALEK
We should leave before he attempts another attack.
O'NEILL
It took a GDO. No one's goin' anywhere.
MALEK
Colonel, you saw what he was capable...
O'NEILL
Yes, I did. That's why I want all available personnel guarding that
Gate. That includes Tok'ra and Jaffa.
MALEK
Colonel...
O'NEILL
(angrily)
Go help Carter!
[Malek and Carter continue their work on the reactor]
RAK'NOR
A true warrior would show himself.
TEAL'C
Patience, Rak'nor. As Bra'tac would have said, a Jaffa has many
senses with which to fight.
JACOB
Okay, Sam? Malek, how close are we?
MALEK
200 nanometres.
JACOB
That's still ultraviolet.
CARTER
We need to reach at least 400 to be in visual range.
MALEK
If we all perish, there'll be no one left to carry on the fight.
RAK'NOR
The Jaffa will fight side by side with the Tok'ra. And, if need be,
die side by side.
[Teal'c bows his head in agreement]
CARTER
Malek, what's that read?
MALEK
420 nanometres.
CARTER
Sir, we're there. Powering up 50 per cent.
[Carter activates the reactor which begins to produce an energy field]
O'NEILL
Ooh! Anybody else feel that?
CARTER
The tingling sensation is caused by the energy field. It's not
causing any physical damage, so there's nothing to worry about, sir.
O'NEILL
No, I like it. It's good.
MALEK
The power setting may not counteract the cloaking device, but
increasing it will substantially reduce our ability to sustain the
field.
O'NEILL
Crank it up.
CARTER
Yes, sir. Powering up 100 per cent.
[Carter powers up the reactor and the figure of the Ashrak shimmers
into view right in front of Carter. He hits her and she falls to the
ground. He hits the humans, Jaffa and Tok'ra in the vicinity and
vanishes again. O'Neill fires his P90 but the Ashrak has already become
invisible again.]
O'NEILL
(to the men guarding the Gate)
Hold your positions! Carter, are we still in business?
CARTER
(getting up and running back to the reactor)
Yes, sir, I just need to bring it back online.
[Malek and Carter go back to work on the reactor]
PIERCE
(to those guarding the Stargate)
Watch those gaps!
[O'Neill reloads his P90. The invisible Ashrak again approaches Carter
and Malek. He then goes near Teal'c, who senses him coming]
TEAL'C
Rak'nor!
[Rak'nor is pushed over by the Ashrak and takes Teal'c with him as he
falls. O'Neill fires some rounds with his P90. He then puts down the
P90]
O'NEILL
Everybody down!
[O'Neill takes out a huge machine gun and begins to fire it while
carefully turning around almost 360 degrees. Everyone else is lying on
the ground. Carter turns the reactor back on and then everyone starts
to get back up. Suddenly the Ashrak appears on O'Neill's left. O'Neill
starts to draw his knife as the Ashrak runs towards him. Suddenly, the
Ashrak is hit in the back by a staff weapon blast. His cloaking device
is now completely deactivated and he is fully visible. The Ashrak
wavers only for a moment and then continues to run forward. He is hit a
second and then a third time before he finally falls. Bra'tac is
standing behind the Ashrak, looking badly hurt.]
RAK'NOR
Master Bra'tac!
[Teal'c and Rak'nor run to Bra'tac and support him]
O'NEILL
(into his radio)
Pierce, stand down. We got him.
PIERCE
Yes, sir.
[Carter takes Pierce's GDO from the Ashrak's arm and gives it to
O'Neill]
FRAISER
(to Bra'tac)
You're very lucky to be alive.
BRA'TAC
Indeed. This Ashrak left me for dead. I was unable to move, and do
not know how long I was unconscious. My symbiote sustained me, and I
returned as soon as I could.
O'NEILL
Not bad.
[Bra'tac nods and smiles]
MALEK
I owe you my life, twice over. I only hope that one day I am given
the chance to repay that debt. Forgive me.
[Malek reaches out his arm to Bra'tac, who takes it in acknowledgement]
BRA'TAC
(taking the weapon of the Ashrak)
This single blade did what we could not. It has brought us together.
This blade has spilled the blood of Jaffa, of the Tok'ra and of the
Tauri. By the hand of our common enemy, it has made us brothers.
Together, we have ensured it will never spill our blood again.
[Bra'tac throws the blade tip first into the sand.]
