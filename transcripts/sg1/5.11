Desperate Measures
TEASER
EXT--WOODED AREA
[A man is lighting a cigarette. A truck approaches on the road and
pulls up to two soldiers. The driver and passenger get out and converse
in Russian. Ground soldiers open fire on the driver, passenger and
others in the back of the truck. The first soldier enters the back of
the truck to find a prisoner, whose hat is pushed up to reveal a Jaffa
tattoo on his forehead.]
EXT--DOWNTOWN AREA
[Carter exits a building in civilian clothes, carrying a gym bag. She
proceeds to her car in the parking lot where a white van approaches
her. A homeless man watches as three ninja-types exit the white van,
fight with Carter and take her. The van speeds away.]
HOMELESS MAN
Ninjas.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Inside are Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c and General Hammond.]
HAMMOND
The forensic team found nothing in her house. According to one of
the neighbors, Major Carter got into her car and left around 8:30
Saturday morning.
O'NEILL
That's over 48 hours.
[Daniel Jackson enters.]
DANIEL
Police found Sam's car in a parking lot at some fitness club twelve
blocks from her house.
O'NEILL
Anything else?
DANIEL
No witnesses.
HAMMOND
We have no jurisdiction outside this facility, Colonel.
O'NEILL
I know. We can still look, can't we?
[Hammond and O'Neill exchange looks.]
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter is strapped to a bed, struggling to get free.]
DOCTOR #1
Good morning, Major.
CARTER
What's going on? Where am I?
DOCTOR #1
In a hospital.
CARTER
What happened?
DOCTOR #1
We just need to run a few tests.
CARTER
What tests? Why am I restrained? Stop! NO!
[Carter struggles some more.]
EXT--PARKING LOT
HOMELESS MAN
Feet, I said. Look at his feet. Huge. Never trust a man with feet
that big.
O'NEILL
Hi, there.
HOMELESS MAN
Go away. This is my stuff.
O'NEILL
I just want to ask you a couple of questions.
HOMELESS MAN
Got a dollar?
O'NEILL
Here's two.
HOMELESS MAN
Thanks
O'NEILL
We you around here Saturday?
HOMELESS MAN
Why should I tell you?
O'NEILL
I gave you two dollars.
HOMELESS MAN
I thought you were just being generous.
O'NEILL
How generous do I have to get?
[The homeless man approaches O'Neill and his money.]
HOMELESS MAN
You a cop?
O'NEILL
Air force. Colonel Jack O'Neill.
HOMELESS MAN
I was in 'Nam.
O'NEILL
Yeah, what company?
HOMELESS MAN
Vacation. Long time ago.
O'NEILL
Um, a friend of mine disappeared from around here on Saturday
morning. Woman, about 5-9ish, blonde.
HOMELESS MAN
You wouldn't believe me if I told you?
O'NEILL
Why not?
HOMELESS MAN
Well, I'm just a crazy old guy with a shopping cart full of cans.
[O'Neill shrugs.]
O'NEILL
I'm just a cynical old Air Force guy with a closet full of National
Geographics.
HOMELESS MAN
Can I have 'em?
O'NEILL
What do you know?
HOMELESS MAN
She was feisty, put up a fight.
O'NEILL
With who?
HOMELESS MAN
Ninjas. Three, maybe four. Happened fast. They pulled up in a white
van, grabbed her. I've been telling the police about ninjas for
years. Think they listen?
O'NEILL
Right. Okay. Thanks.
HOMELESS MAN
You're gonna bring me them magazines, right?
O'NEILL
You bet.
INT--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE
[Daniel is sitting at his computer, with a movie site open on the
screen.]
DANIEL
So you think Maybourne's a fan of Godzilla movies?
O'NEILL
Ah, he strikes me as more of a Mothra guy.
DANIEL
Don't get it.
O'NEILL
NID agents use these sites to post coded messages. If I know
Maybourne, he's keeping tabs on his old buddies.
DANIEL
Okay, what kind of message you want to send?
O'NEILL
Make it "Hutch, we need to talk". Sign it "Starsky". He'll
understands.
[Daniel types on the keyboard.]
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter is being pushed on a gurney through the halls into a large
examination room.]
DOCTOR #2
We got the first blood tests back. You're going to want to see this.
We found an unusual protein marker as well as traces of an
unidentified heavy metal.
DOCTOR #1
What do you mean, unidentified?
DOCTOR #2
Nothing I've ever seen before.
DOCTOR #1
We better double check these results with the lab in Phoenix.
[Carter stumbles off the gurney, knocking over a cart.]
DOCTOR #1
She's strong. I gave her enough chloryl hydrate to put down a man
twice her size.
[Carter finds a scapel on the floor and slips it into her shirt
sleeve.]
DOCTOR #1
All right, Major.
[The two doctors help Carter up.]
EXT--PARKING LOT
[O'Neill parks his truck and removes a crate from the back. He looks
around for the Homeless Man. He drops off the crate and returns to the
truck.]
MAYBOURNE
Hi, Jack. Don't turn around.
[O'Neill turns around.]
O'NEILL
Harry, where ya been? You never write. You don't call.
MAYBOURNE
I have a gun.
O'NEILL
So do I.
MAYBOURNE
I'm just trying to protect you. I'm a wanted criminal. It's your
duty to arrest me and all.
O'NEILL
Always thinking of the other guy. How'd you find me?
MAYBOURNE
Played a lot of hide and seek as a kid. Funny, I could always find
anyone anywhere but they could never find me.
O'NEILL
Because they didn't want to.
MAYBOURNE
What do you need Jack?
O'NEILL
Carter's missing.
MAYBOURNE
Really?
O'NEILL
Bunch of guys in a van took her out of this lot about four days ago.
Figured it might be some of yours old friends.
MAYBOURNE
Not the word I'd use for them.
O'NEILL
What do you know?
MAYBOURNE
Sorry.
O'NEILL
You didn't come back into this country and risk execution just to
see me.
MAYBOURNE
God knows I could think of a hundred reasons why the NID might want
Major Carter. But I swear to you I don't know where she is or why
she was taken. Why don't you ask the NID?
O'NEILL
Gee thanks. Hadn't thought of that.
MAYBOURNE
Try user 4575.
O'NEILL
What does that mean?
MAYBOURNE
Wish I could stay and chat.
O'NEILL
Harry. We're talking about Carter here.
MAYBOURNE
I know. I'm sorry. I really am. You know how this game is played and
the kind of people who play it. You gotta prepare yourself for the
possibility that she may not be coming back.
[Maybourne walks away.]
INT--SGC--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond and Daniel are present. Hammond is on the phone.]
HAMMOND
(into phone)
That's all he said? User 4574. I think we know who that is, Colonel.
EXT--PENTAGON
INT--SIMMONS' OFFICE
SECRETARY
Colonel O'Neill is still waiting, sir.
SIMMONS
I know.
SECRETARY
Look, I'm sorry to bother you again, it's just he's getting a
little...
[O'Neill enters the office.]
O'NEILL
Pissed... is the word. It happens when you keep someone waiting two
hours.
SIMMONS
Well, welcome to the Pentagon, Colonel.
(To secretary)
Thank you, Delores.
(To O'Neill)
You have to forgive me, I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
O'NEILL
Yeah, it's just someone's life at stake here. Sorry to take you away
from your turkey sandwich.
SIMMONS
It's ham and cheese, actually, and I'm the one who's sorry because
obviously you wasted a trip to Washington.
O'NEILL
I don't think so.
SIMMONS
You know I was just recently reading about Major Carter's
disappearance. I couldn't help but wonder whether glowing aliens had
something to do with it.
O'NEILL
Look, Simmons, I don't expect you just to tell me what's going on
but I guarantee this trip will be a waste. If I have to I'll spend
the rest of my life in this building getting to the bottom of all
this and how it ties to you.
SIMMONS
Why are you so convinced I have something to do with this?
O'NEILL
A reliable source told me.
SIMMONS
I think I know who you're referring to, Colonel, and are you telling
me you're trusting a convicted traitor?
O'NEILL
More than you at the moment.
SIMMONS
Look, your opinion of me and this organization has been tainted by
the actions of the very man you're talking about.
O'NEILL
I doubt very much was acting alone.
SIMMONS
The NID is a legitimate organization financed by this government
which has been duly elected by the people of this country.
O'NEILL
Damn, that has a familiar ring to it.
SIMMONS
Our mandate is clear
O'NEILL
I'm a simple man. Explain it to me.
SIMMONS
We provide vital civilian oversight of top secret military
operations.
O'NEILL
Yeah, and who watches over you?
SIMMONS
We're not unaccountable, Colonel, and I admit there's been some
minor indiscretions in the past perpetrated by a few renegade
individuals but they've been exposed and they will be brought to
justice with or without your help.
O'NEILL
Maybourne is pointing a finger at you.
SIMMONS
Yeah, well, hasn't it ever occurred to you that maybe Maybourne is
trying to mask his own involvement?
O'NEILL
I'll need some convincing.
SIMMONS
Well, we recently traced a deposit made into one of Maybourne's
offshore accounts. The transfer took place in a numbered company in
the Cayman Islands.
O'NEILL
Three million dollars.
SIMMONS
Yeah, makes you kind of wonder what he did to earn that kind of
money, doesn't it?
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter looks around, sees the camera turned away from her and starts
cutting away at the restraint with the scapel she took earlier.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
DANIEL
The holding company that paid Maybourne is a subsidiary of a
multinational corporation called Zetatron Industries.
HAMMOND
That sounds familiar.
DANIEL
It's run by a man named Adrian Conrad. He made a couple hundred
million in something called fiber optic host channel adapters and
then had the good sense to diversify before the tech market bottomed
out. Now he's into everything from shipyards to sports wear
factories.
TEAL'C
What is his connection to Maybourne?
DANIEL
Well, isn't it pretty common for ex-spies to sell information to the
private sector?
HAMMOND
We know he's had access to extensive files on the SGC, including
every member of SG-1.
DANIEL
Well, the interesting thing is that Adrian Conrad hasn't been seen
in public in over six months. His last appearance was a live video
feed from their head office in Seattle to a Zetatron stockholders'
meeting.
O'NEILL
Really not much to go on.
DANIEL
The only other thing I can tell you is who authorized the payment.
Her name is Diana Mendez. She was Conrad's assitant and the last
person known to have seen him.
INT--OFFICE OF DIANA MENDEZ
MAYBOURNE
Working late?
MENDEZ
How did you get in here?
MAYBOURNE
Well, the ability to sneak around was an important prerequisite of
my former occupation.
MENDEZ
What do you want?
MAYBOURNE
To know about the disappearance of an Air Force major.
MENDEZ
I have no idea who you're talking about.
MAYBOURNE
Then maybe I should talk to your boss.
MENDEZ
He's unavailable.
MAYBOURNE
You know, the other prerequisite of my former occupation was an
absence of moral conscience. Really gives you the freedom to do
whatever you have to do.
[Maybourne moves a "desk cannon" on the desk to face Mendez.]
MENDEZ
Threatening me doesn't change what I know.
MAYBOURNE
This major disappeared right after we closed our deal. I have very
good reason to believe it wasn't a coincidence.
MENDEZ
I'm sure Adrian wouldn't be involved in anything like that.
MAYBOURNE
Oh no. Did he tell you what you were buying for him?
MENDEZ
Something valued ten million dollars by a renegade faction of
Russian military intelligence, less your cut of course.
MAYBOURNE
Oh, well.
MENDEZ
I don't know what it was exactly.
MAYBOURNE
I'm surprised. I thought you two had a very close working
relationship.
MENDEZ
I do my job and I don't ask questions.
MAYBOURNE
What if I told you there was enough uranium to fuel a terrorist
nuke. Just how far would you be willing to go then?
MENDEZ
You're lying.
MAYBOURNE
Maybe.
MENDEZ
You made your deposit and you got paid. As far as I'm concerned, our
association is finished.
[Maybourne stares at Mendez and leaves. ]
INT--GARAGE
[He enters the building garage and approaches his car. O'Neill
approaches him from behind.]
O'NEILL
Harry.
MAYBOURNE
Jack, you're stealing my routine.
O'NEILL
Consider it an homage.
MAYBOURNE
What's up, Jack. I thought we trusted each other.
O'NEILL
You lied to me. Get in.
[Maybourne and O'Neill enter the vehicle.]
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter is on the bed, eyes opening and closing. She cuts away slowly
at the restraint strap. One of the doctors enters.]
DOCTOR #1
Hello again, Major Carter. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a
few questions. I don't know if I mentioned what a thrill this is for
me. I mean, I wish we didn't have to do it under these conditions,
but given the circumstances... You're a very unique individual. You
may well hold the key to the future of medical science.
CARTER
You made a big mistake.
DOCTOR #1
We know what happened to you. We know that you were the host of an
alien symbiote.
CARTER
I'm a physicist. I study deep space radar telemetry.
DOCTOR #1
Please, Major. Don't waste my time with that rididulous cover story.
Tell me what you can about the symbiote.
INT--HOSPITAL LAB ROOM
[Another doctor and Mendez are watching Carter on a tv screen.]
DOCTOR #2
She's never going to talk.
MENDEZ
What about the tests?
DOCTOR #2
We have a couple of leads, but nothing definite yet.
MENDEZ
We're running out of time.
DOCTOR #2
I know. We may have to move the implantation ahead of schedule.
[A symbiote is swimming in a tank.]
INT--MAYBOURNE'S CAR
[Maybourne and O'Neill are in the car, with Maybourne driving.]
MAYBOURNE
Technically, I didn't lie. I said I didn't know where Carter was or
why she was taken.
O'NEILL
What was the three million dollars for?
MAYBOURNE
I aquired a piece of merchandise from the Russians and sold it to
Zetatron.
O'NEILL
What?
MAYBOURNE
A symbiote.
O'NEILL
What?!
MAYBOURNE
On their second mission, back when their gate was active, the
Russions ran into a group of Jaffa.
O'NEILL
I read that report.
MAYBOURNE
What the report didn't say was the Russians managed to take one of
the Jaffa alive and held him in custody ever since.
O'NEILL
Man, you gotta love those guys.
MAYBOURNE
The Russians or the Jaffa?
O'NEILL
Both, actually.
MAYBOURNE
Apparently, the symbiote was reaching maturity. I don't know what
the Russians had planned. I assume Zetatron wanted it for their
biotech division.
O'NEILL
So why kidnap Carter?
MAYBOURNE
Carter once had a symbiote inside her and lived to tell about it.
O'NEILL
How did they know that?
MAYBOURNE
I don't know. I also don't know how they found out about me and my
connections, but when people offer 3 million dollars, you don't ask
any questions.
O'NEILL
Why not?
MAYBOURNE
Believe me, Jack, I never thought it was going to come to this.
O'NEILL
What did you think was gonna happen?
MAYBOURNE
Well, in the right hands, a symbiote could lead to all kinds of
medical breakthroughs.
O'NEILL
What, you're a humanitarian now?
MAYBOURNE
Gonna turn me in?
O'NEILL
Actually, that overwhelming desire to shoot you has come back.
MAYBOURNE
But you still need me, Jack.
O'NEILL
Why?
MAYBOURNE
Because I know the name of the doctor who took delivery of the
symbiote.
[Maybourne and O'Neill exchange looks and drive on.]
INT--OFFICE BUILDING
[Someone is trying to open the door of Dr. Neil Brooke, Immunology,
Room 202. After breaking in, a light at a desk shines on Maybourne.]
MAYBOURNE
You know, we make a pretty good team, Jack.
O'NEILL
Shut up.
MAYBOURNE
I'm just saying if you ever get tired of the SGC, we could make more
money than you every dreamed of.
O'NEILL
Hey, G. Gordon, don't give me another reason to shoot you, all
right?
[Maybourne is typing at a computer.]
MAYBOURNE
I'm in. Adrian Conrad's medical file.
[He prints the file.]
INT--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM
FRAISER
It would appear Adrian Conrad is in the late stages of an extremely
rare disorder known as Berchart's syndrome. It's a condition that
affects the immune system leaving the body vulnerable to a host of
diseases and ... there's no known cure.
TEAL'C
Except the healing powers of a Goa'uld symbiote.
DANIEL
The only way that would work would be through implantation.
FRAISER
They may be studying the symbiote, trying to isolate and
artificially reproduce its healing properties.
TEAL'C
Major Carter's experience with Jolinar would make her a valuable
source of information.
HAMMOND
What are their chances of success?
FRAISER
Well, obviously we've been researching this for some time, sir. Even
with unlimited resources, I'd be greatly surprised if they came up
with the answers quickly. And if they're trying to save this man's
life, they're running out of time.
HAMMOND
How do we find him?
FRAISER
Given his condition, he would require constant medical supervision.
He must be in some kind of a hospital or well-equipped facility.
DANIEL
Saint...something. When I was checking out the holdings of that
numbered company...Saint Christina's. It's a hospital in the suburbs
of Seattle, it's been shut down for a couple of years.
[Daniel hands Hammond a piece of paper.]
HAMMOND
I'll contact the local authorities. You and Teal'c can meet Colonel
O'Neill there. A jet will be prepped and ready to go by the time you
get to the airport.
EXT--SAINT CHRISTINA'S HOSPITAL
INT--HOSPITAL LAB ROOM
[From the tv screen, Carter in bed can be seen by Doctor #2 who turns
away, then looks back to the television to find the bed empty.]
DOCTOR #2
Security, Major Carter's missing. She can't have gotten far.
INT--HOSPITAL CORRIDORS
[Carter runs through the halls of the hospital. A guard with a gun
looks for her, then gets kicked by Carter who takes his gun. She comes
up against a locked door. A man in a wheelchair approaches.]
CONRAD
The exits are sealed, Major.
[Carter turns and draws a gun on him.]
CARTER
Who are you? What the hell am I doing here?
CONRAD
My name is Adrian Conrad. You're here because of me.
[Guards approach.]
CARTER
Back off or I shoot him.
CONRAD
Go ahead. If I let you go, I'm dead anyway. Please Major Carter, if
you put the gun down, there's a very good chance we could both live.
[Carter puts down the gun.]
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter is led back to the examination room and then locked onto the
bed rail with handcuffs. Conrad enters in a wheelchair along with two
doctors. Conrad is coughing.]
CONRAD
Sorry about this, Major, but I've run out of options.
CARTER
What now?
CONRAD
My immune system's been destroyed. The damage is irreversible.
CARTER
I don't care what's wrong with you. Nothing gives you the right...
CONRAD
The human race has progressed to where we are today because of men
who broke rules and risked everything most often because they had no
choice. The only thing that can save me is an alien symbiote. You
call them Goa'uld.
CARTER
How do you know about that?
CONRAD
We know about the Stargate. Everything.
CARTER
Well, then you must also know that a symbiote would leave you a
prisoner inside your own body.
DOCTOR #2
That's why we're working on a way to have it removed.
DOCTOR #1
And you're the key to that.
CARTER
It's beyond our current medical science.
DOCTOR #2
You survived your encounter with the alien Jolinar.
CARTER
That was different. The symbiote made a conscious choice.
DOCTOR #2
Maybe so, but the process you went through could provide us with the
answers we're looking for.
DOCTOR #1
You can't deny being able to extract a symbiote from a human host
would be a monumental breakthrough.
CARTER
A lot of very smart people have been working toward that end
already.
CONRAD
Maybe they aren't quite desperate enough.
[Conrad starts coughing.]
DOCTOR #2
Mr. Conrad.
[Two doctors wheel Conrad out.]
INT--HOSPITAL LAB ROOM
[Conrad is in a bed in the lab, a mask over his face.]
DOCTOR #2
Pulse is weak, blood pressure's dropping.
DOCTOR #1
We're running out of time. We're going to have to proceed with the
implantation.
MENDEZ
You can't. We put that thing inside him and we may never get it out.
DOCTOR #1
We'll find a way.
MENDEZ
Even if you do, you don't know if the healing process will have a
lasting effect.
DOCTOR #2
We're reasonably sure once the symbiote cures the disease...
[Conrad removes his mask.]
CONRAD
Diana, it's okay.
MENDEZ
Adrian, you can't do this. Please.
CONRAD
It's my only chance.
DOCTOR #2
We're going to have to restrain him.
[The doctors apply restraints. There is a symbiote swimming in a tank.]
EXT--HOSPITAL
INT--SWAT TRUCK
[O'Neill, Maybourne, Teal'c, Daniel and SWAT team members are getting
gear and clothing.]
O'NEILL
Cover the exits and wait for my signal and somebody watch that guy
[He points at Maybourne.]
MAYBOURNE
C'mon, Jack. This is my fault. Let me try and help fix it.
O'NEILL
Fine, grab a vest. You're with me.
MAYBOURNE
Can I have my gun back?
O'NEILL
(To SWAT soldier)
Go.
(To Maybourne)
No! Daniel Teal'c, take the front entrance.
INT--HOSPITAL LAB ROOM
[Conrad is on a bed, fighting the restraints. He then calms, and opens
his eyes, which glow.]
DOCTOR #2
BP's stabilizing. Vitals returning to normal.
DOCTOR #1
Incredible.
CONRAD
Diana?
MENDEZ
How do you feel?
CONRAD
The pain is...is gone.
DOCTOR #1
We're going to need to run a full set of tests.
MENDEZ
How long?
DOCTOR #1
For what?
MENDEZ
You said you'd find a way to get it out of him. How long you plan to
leave him this way?
DOCTOR #1
We don't even know what kind of effect it's...
MENDEZ
I don't give a damn. Get that thing out of him.
DOCTOR #2
We have a bit of problem in that area.
MENDEZ
What are you talking about?
DOCTOR #1
Major Carter's test results already indicate that she holds the key
to a safe extraction process.
MENDEZ
That's good.
DOCTOR #2
Unfortunately, we know just enough to know the answers are there. We
just can't get there.
MENDEZ
Why not?
DOCTOR #1
Because Adrian didn't approve the method that's ultimately
necessary.
MENDEZ
What does that mean?
DOCTOR #2
It would require direct examination of her brain tissue.
[Mendez looks over at Conrad.]
MENDEZ
Do whatever it takes.
INT--HOSPITAL--ENTRANCE AREA
[Two guards are sitting, one in an admission booth. Daniel enters
holding his right arm.]
DANIEL
Ah!
GUARD
Can I help you?
DANIEL
Yeah, I need to see a doctor. I think I just electrocuted myself.
GUARD
You're gonna to have to go somewhere else.
DANIEL
I have insurance.
[The guard exits the admission booth and comes around to face Daniel.]
GUARD
This hospital is closed.
DANIEL
I said I think I just electrocuted myself. Do you have any idea what
that feels like?
GUARD
No.
[Daniel zats them both.]
DANIEL
Something like that.
[Teal'c enters and they both walk down hall, looking in rooms as they
go. Elsewhere, O'Neill and Maybourne are walking down a hall. O'Neill
goes into a room as a guard comes up on Maybourne.]
GUARD
Freeze. Who are you? What are you doing here?
[O'Neill hits the guard from behind. Maybourne takes the guard's gun.]
O'NEILL
Ah, ah.
MAYBOURNE
Want me to watch your back or not?
[Maybourne proceeds down the hall, as O'Neill follows him.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
INT--HOSPITAL LAB ROOM
[Conrad is in bed, Mendez at his bedside.]
CONRAD
I know this has been hard on you Diana. I'm sorry.
MENDEZ
I just want you to get better.
CONRAD
I am better. I can feel it. If you just let me out of these
restraints, I can show you.
MENDEZ
I can't do that.
CONRAD
I've been cooped up in a hospital for the last six months. All I
want to do is go outside and breathe some fresh air.
MENDEZ
But you have that thing inside youj.
CONRAD
It's not controlling me. I'm controlling it. Can't you tell? Diana,
please you don't have to kill Major Carter. I'm fine. Everything's
going to be okay.
MENDEZ
I wish I could believe you.
CONRAD
Look at me. You know me better than anyone in the whole world. I did
this for you so we could be together. Just let one hand go so I can
touch your face.
[Conrad and Mendez hold hands.]
INT--HOSPITAL--CARTER'S EXAM ROOM
[Two doctors enter and start to remove Carter from the gurney. She
struggles.]
CARTER
What's happening? What are you doing? What are you doing? Ow!
[A doctor prepares a syringe for Carter.]
CARTER
You're going to kill me!
DOCTOR #2
You could be saving millions of lives.
[O'Neill and Maybourne enter, pointing their guns at doctors.]
O'NEILL
Hold it, doc. Drop it right now. Don't even fool around. Put it
down.
MAYBOURNE
(To doctors)
Come over here and face the wall.
O'NEILL
(To Carter)
You all right?
CARTER
Yes. Very dramatic. Thank you.
O'NEILL
You bet.
CARTER
Keys for the cuffs are in his pocket.
[Maybourne goes through the doctor's jacket pockets, find keys, and
throws them to O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Daniel, we got Carter. She's okay.
DANIEL
That's good. I think we have another problem, though.

INT--HOSPITAL--CARTER'S EXAM ROOM
[Carter jumps off the gurney.]
CARTER
They put it in Conrad to cure him. They thought they could use me to
find a way to remove it.
O'NEILL
Good to go?
[O'Neill gives Carter a gun.]
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
(To Maybourne)
Why don't you stay here and watch these guys?
MAYBOURNE
That's fine.
O'NEILL
You'll be here when I get back, right?
MAYBOURNE
Oh, yes, Jack.
[Maybourne and O'Neill exchange looks.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Daniel, Teal'c, take the upper levels.
INT--HOSPITAL
[Carter and O'Neill and Daniel and Teal'c search through the hospital
halls and rooms. Daniel enters an exam room to find the two doctors
chained to a gurney.]
INT--HOSPITAL--CARTER'S EXAM ROOM
[O'Neill is in the basement, which is dark, wet and smoky. Conrad jumps
down into the basement hallway.]
O'NEILL
Where you going?
[Conrad turns toward O'Neill, eyes glowing.]
CONRAD/GOA'ULD
Shoot me and you'll kill the host.
O'NEILL
Don't make me.

at him. Through the smoke and dark walks Simmons.]
SIMMONS
You want to live, you come with me.

Man down. Colonel O'Neill's been shot. This is Major Carter. I'm in
the boiler room. Repeat. Colonel O'Neill has been shot. We need an
ambulance now.
O'NEILL
Uh!
CARTER
Sir, are you okay?
O'NEILL
I've been shot, Carter
CARTER
I know. Your vest shopped one of the bullets.
O'NEILL
I want sleeves on my vest.
CARTER
You're going to be fine. Help's on the way.
O'NEILL
I'm not kidding. They should put sleeves on these things.
CARTER
Did you see who shot you?
O'NEILL
No.
CARTER
Hang in there sir.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[O'Neill is in a bed, Carter and Hammond at his bedside.]
O'NEILL
I can't believe the son of a bitch shot me.
CARTER
We don't know for sure that it was Maybourne.
HAMMOND
We also don't know how Maybourne and Adrian Conrad got by the men
surrounding the hospital. However, the local authorities admitted
they may have dropped the ball.
O'NEILL
May? May have?
HAMMOND
The FBI and Interpol have been alerted. Unfortunately, we can't tell
them everything.
CARTER
The bottom line is, there's a Goa'uld out there somewhere.
INT--INTERROGATION ROOM
[Conrad/Goa'uld is sitting at a table. Simmons enters.]
CONRAD/GOA'ULD
I expect better treatment than this.
SIMMONS
Well, right now you have no choice. But once you start delivering on
your end of our little bargain, I might be able to move you to
better accommodations.
CONRAD/GOA'ULD
You cannot offer anything of equal value to the knowledge I possess.
[Simmons smiles.]
SIMMONS
I'm not so sure about that.
[Simmons exists. Conrad/Goa'uld remains seated at the table.]
