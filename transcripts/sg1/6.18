EXT--CLEARING ON P2X-005
[O'Neill approaches Carter, who is fiddling with a telescope and other
equipment set up in the clearing.]
O'NEILL
(singing to himself)
....and tell me that you love me....
(to Carter)
Lots of interesting nebulous things going on?
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[O'Neill looks into the telescope.]
O'NEILL
I don't see squat.
CARTER
Well, you wouldn't, sir, during the day.
[He straightens abruptly.]
CARTER
When the local sun sets and it gets dark, you can actually see a
luminous layer of ionised gas around the dying core expanding.
O'NEILL
Fascinating.
CARTER
You don't care.
O'NEILL
Hey, I like gas as much as the next guy.
[He lightly touches her shoulder and walks away, while Carter laughs.]
CARTER
Five hours to darkness, sir.
O'NEILL
Okay.
[He sits down on a rock to tie his boots, and notices something on the
ground. It's a badly-creased photograph of a woman.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Yes, sir?
O'NEILL
We've never been to this planet before, have we? "We" meaning humans
from Earth.
CARTER
No sir, why?
[He starts to show her the photo, and is interrupted by Jonas on the
radio.]
JONAS
(over the radio)
Colonel, Major. You have to see this.
O'NEILL
Okay. You'll have to let us know where you are.
JONAS
(over the radio)
Right. Ah, head east.
EXT--HILL OVERLOOKING A VALLEY
[O'Neill and Carter join Jonas, who is looking at the remains of a
crashed ship down in the valley.]
JONAS
Incredible, isn't it?
O'NEILL
That had to hurt.
[They head down to the ship, where Teal'c is already standing.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, what do you got here?
TEAL'C
I am unfamiliar with this type of vessel, O'Neill. It is not
Goa'uld.
CARTER
It's not Asgard or Tollan, either.
[Jonas examines writing on the hull, and takes a picture of it.]
JONAS
Some of these markings resemble ancient Celtic.
CARTER
(calls into the open hatch)
Hello! (to the others)
Looks like there were no survivors.
CORSO
Actually, there were three of us.
[The members of SG-1 spin around to find two men and a woman standing
behind them with weapons drawn.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CLEARING NEXT TO A FOREST
O'NEILL
Now what?
CORSO
You tell me.
JONAS
We're peaceful explorers, okay? We didn't come here to harm anybody.
O'NEILL
Unless otherwise provoked.
[Corso looks at the others, and they all lower their weapons.]
CORSO
I'm Aden Corso, captain of the Seberus. This is my first officer,
Tanis Reynard, and navigator Lyle Pender.
O'NEILL
Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force. Teal'c, Major Carter, Jonas
Quinn.
CARTER
We're from a planet called Earth.
PENDER
Never heard of it.
CARTER
It's....
O'NEILL
Nice. It's nice.
CORSO
I'm sure it is. Sorry for the less than warm welcome, but you kinda
snuck up on us.
REYNARD
We didn't hear your ship land.
O'NEILL
No, you wouldn't.
CARTER
How long have you been here?
CORSO
Too long.
JONAS
Rough landing.
CORSO
It's not as bad as it looks.
REYNARD
We were on our way to relieve an off-world mineral extraction team
when an asteroid storm blew us right off course.
PENDER
Fuel line got messed up in the crash and all the reserves leaked out
before we knew what was happening.
CORSO
You wouldn't happen to have a whole load of extra fuel in your ship,
would you?
O'NEILL
Not exactly.
PENDER
I think the engines are okay, we just don't have enough power in the
batteries to fire them up. All we have access to is a few auxiliary
systems.
CARTER
Communications?
REYNARD
First thing to get hit in the storm.
CORSO
Couldn't even get a distress signal off. What's frustrating is that
our home planet Hebridan must be close. We could plot a course if
you could take three passengers.
O'NEILL
That might be a problem.
TEAL'C
We did not travel to this world by vessel.
JONAS
We came through the stargate.
CORSO
Excuse me?
O'NEILL
Big O? Decent walk that way.
CORSO
We didn't know what that was.
CARTER
It's a transportation device.
CORSO
That explains a few things.
JONAS
I take it you don't have one where you come from?
CORSO
Not that I know of. Really no ship?
O'NEILL
No ship.
CORSO
How does this stargate work exactly?
[We pull back to see two aliens watching them from the woods. One alien
moves off.]
CARTER
Well, basically, each gate has an address based on its home planet's
point in space.
JONAS
That address is represented by.... (muffled)
EXT--CLEARING
O'NEILL
Carter, Teal'c. (to the others)
Excuse us a moment.
[They step a short distance away.]
O'NEILL
Any suggestions?
TEAL'C
We could offer them sanctuary on Earth.
CARTER
Or, we could fix their ship. I'm just saying it's possible. If all
they need is fuel, then maybe we can find an Earth equivalent. I may
be able to recharge their batteries using a naqahdah generator. I'd
have to take a look at their technology.
[O'Neill removes his sunglasses and wipes his face with his hand.]
O'NEILL
And why would we do this?
CARTER
So I can take a look at their technology. They seem to have space
flight capabilities beyond our own, and maybe they'd be grateful.
Who knows what else they may have to offer?
O'NEILL
Okay. We charge by the hour, no flat rate for these kids.
[They rejoin the group.]
TEAL'C
The Celts were formidable warriors in their time. Their descendants
may make valuable allies.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
You've seen Braveheart too often.
(to the others)
But that doesn't mean we're not going to help you folks out. Carter
has to have a closer look at your ship. Worse case scenario, you end
up on Earth.
CORSO
Thank you, we'd like to see your world and learn more about the
stargate. If you could get our ship going, our first priority would
be to get home.
CARTER
Let's take a look.
[Everyone moves off in various directions. O'Neill goes over to Teal'c,
who is scanning the forest with a frown.]
O'NEILL
T?
TEAL'C
I do not know, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Keep me posted.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
INT--INSIDE THE SHIP
[Corso and Carter climb down a metal stairway and head further into the
ship.]
CARTER
What can you tell me?
CORSO
Not as much as my chief engineer could. He's dead. But I'll do my
best.
EXT--IN THE CLEARING
[O'Neill leaves Jonas talking with Reynard and Pender beside the ship,
and walks back to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Still?
TEAL'C
There is something out there, O'Neill.
[Reynard suddenly raises her weapon.]
REYNARD
Move! Move!
[She fires into the forest, just missing an alien.]
REYNARD
Drop low!
[They all drop down onto their stomachs. A fire fight begins, with
Carter leaving the ship to help. O'Neill shoots one of the aliens in
the leg, and he cries out and turns to limp away. Pender then shoots
him in the back, killing him. The second alien fires at Reynard,
wounding her in the arm, and Carter fires back.]
[Inside the ship, Corso levers up an instrument that creates a
high-pitched whine. Everyone covers their ears, and the alien screams
in pain and runs away. Corso turns the sound off, and exits the ship.]
CORSO
Are they gone?
PENDER
Yeah.
[O'Neill and Teal'c head for the alien, while Carter, Jonas, and Corso
go to Reynard.]
[Teal'c turns the alien over.]
TEAL'C
He is dead, O'Neill.
[Pender has followed them, and lowers his weapon when he hears the
alien is dead.]
O'NEILL
What the hell was that all about?
PENDER
These guys have been hunting us from the moment we crashed.
O'NEILL
With your own weapon?
EXT--CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE SHIP
[O'Neill, Pender, and Teal'c approach the others.]
O'NEILL
Captain?
CORSO
Colonel, I'm sorry I didn't warn you about that sooner. It's been so
long since they attacked, we started to think we were free and
clear.
O'NEILL
Who the heck are they?
CORSO
We don't know. They've killed five of my crew members since we
crashed. Skinned 'em alive and hung 'em up in the trees. Whoever or
whatever they are, they're savages.
O'NEILL
Where are they from?
CORSO
Don't know. There's no civilization on this planet as far as we can
tell.
PENDER
We haven't seen any ships, either.
CORSO
Now that we know the stargate is a transportation device, they must
be coming through that.
[Carter is supporting Reynard, who coughs and then moans.]
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Sir, she's in need of medical attention.
O'NEILL
All right, let's all get back to Earth, then.
CORSO
Colonel, if you can do something to help her, please do it, but I'm
staying with my ship. From what you've said, it's still our best
chance to get back to our home planet, and I'm not giving it
up to these things, not after that they did to my crew. Besides,
defenses should be able to keep them at bay.
O'NEILL
Yeah, that was kind of annoying.
CORSO
We should be able to defend this position until your people have
chance to fix the ship.
O'NEILL
All right, Carter, Jonas, get her back to the gate, we'll watch your
six.
(To Corso)
We'll be back.
CORSO
Thank you.
[We pull back to see the second alien watching as everyone but Corso
and Pender leave.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Jonas is at the screen, speaking as Hammond and Carter listen.]
JONAS
Their home planet is called Hebridan. By the sounds of it, their
ancestors might have come from somewhere near the Outer Hebrides
Islands off the coast of Scotland.
[He goes to sit down.]
CARTER
Based on its position in space, I've determined that it doesn't have
a gate. At least, one that we're aware of.
HAMMOND
Then how did a society of humans evolve there?
CARTER
It's possible the Goa'uld kept a gate there as long as it suited
them, and then took it with them when they left.
JONAS
The real mystery is how their society managed to advance so far
beyond Earth's level of technology.
CARTER
These engines are way ahead of anything that we could build. They
use liquid nitrogen to fuel an ion propulsion system. Personally, I
can't wait to see how they generate enough--
HAMMOND
Your evaluation of these people, Major?
CARTER
Cautiously optimistic, sir.
[Hammond indicates the pictures of the Seberus littering the table.]
HAMMOND
Can you fix it?
CARTER
If I can recharge their batteries using the Naqahdah generator, and
there are no other system problems resulting from the crash,
then....
HAMMOND
Take whatever you need.
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
HAMMOND
And SG-15.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
EXT--EDGE OF THE FOREST
[O'Neill, Teal'c, Corso, and Pender are looking at the dead alien.
O'Neill pulls back the cloth covering him.]
O'NEILL
Got a name for these guys?
CORSO
Nothing polite.
O'NEILL
What kind of weapons were they using before they got yours?
CORSO
Don't know. Nobody survived the first attack and ever since then
they've been using ours. Must like 'em better.
O'NEILL
How many could they have?
CORSO
Eight or nine.
O'NEILL
They travel in pairs?
CORSO
Scouting party. Probably trying to test your fire power.
PENDER
Which isn't very accurate.
O'NEILL
I was trying to wound him.
CORSO
Well the one that got away, I'm sure, is reporting to his friends
right now.
O'NEILL
Yeah, so you say.
CORSO
Believe me, Colonel, they come back, they'll come back in force.
[They head back into the clearing, and see Carter and SG-15.]
CARTER
Sir, Hammond sent SG-15 as back-up.
PIERCE
We have the gate covered, sir.
O'NEILL
Good. We have an unknown number of armed and apparently hostile
aliens in the area.
PIERCE
We got your back, Colonel.
CARTER
Sir, I brought some equipment back to fix the ship, but I'll need
help to get it here.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[Teal'c, Carter, and Pender go to get the equipment.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Reynard is in a bed with her arm in a sling. She turns her head to see
Jonas talking to the guard, then heading over to her.]
JONAS
How are you?
REYNARD
Hey. Fine. At least they stopped the bleeding. Painkillers aren't
bad, either. Should be up and around pretty quick.
JONAS
Good.
REYNARD
I guess I owe you.
JONAS
Not a bit.
[Awkward pause.]
JONAS
So, looking forward to seeing anybody when you get back?
REYNARD
I hate to sound like a hopeless case, but my parents died when I was
young, and I've been serving with Captain Corso since I graduated
flight school ten years ago, so.... He and Pender, they're like my
family. Especially after all we've been through. So, tell me more
about the stargate. How does it work, exactly?
JONAS
Basically, it uses a dimension outside of our known time and space
that we call subspace, and creates a wormhole, which is like a
tunnel, between two connecting gates.
REYNARD
And how many stargates are there?
JONAS
There's a lot of them.
REYNARD
And there are other humans out there like us?
JONAS
Oh yeah, yeah. Some primitive, some advanced, some non-humans as
you're already aware of; some are good, some are bad, some are very
bad, but all in all it is pretty amazing.
REYNARD
Yeah. Sounds like it.
INT--INSIDE THE SHIP
[Corso is checking the main console while Carter looks on.]
CORSO
No engine diagnostics. No life support status. We've been running
the auxiliary weapons systems directly off the battery, but without
a computer we don't know how much power we have left.
CARTER
So, the first thing we need to do is give you a boost so we can get
your computer back online. Then we can give you a full diagnostic.
Any idea how we can interface our power source with your system?
CORSO
I'll show you the engine room.
[They go to the engine room, Corso talking as he goes.]
CORSO
You know, my form is more telling people what to do: fly this way,
fix that, don't crash. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[They put everything down, and Corso opens a panel.]
CORSO
This is the main power coupling.
CARTER
Well, this will do the trick. We'll have to jerry-rig something, but
it should work.
[She goes to the equipment and takes out what she needs, then begins
working.]
CORSO
Amazing. For a supposedly less advanced human you're pretty
comfortable with our technology.
CARTER
Well, you're in luck. I have a little more experience with this sort
of thing than most people on my planet. Besides, all we're really
doing is plugging your ship into my battery.
CORSO
Whatever you say.
CARTER
That didn't sound very good, did it?
CORSO
So, let me get this straight here, Major: you're an officer in your
home world's military, you're a scientist, an explorer, and
apparently you're a pretty fair mechanic.
CARTER
And I make a mean souffl.
CORSO
Sorry?
CARTER
Oh, it's something you eat. It's very difficult to make.
CORSO
Ah, well, add to that list funny, charming, and beautiful.
[She gives him a look.]
CORSO
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. See, rule number one when
you're stranded on an alien planet and someone offers to fix your
ship, flatter them profusely.
CARTER
(pointing to a piece of equipment)
Pass me that.
CORSO
Yeah.
[He passes it to her.]
CARTER
Thank you. And, continue at will.
CORSO
Colonel O'Neill doesn't trust us, does he?
CARTER
Well, trust is something that you have to earn with us. Colonel
O'Neill is less concerned with showing distrust.
CORSO
So, why are you helping us?
CARTER
Well, it's the only way you make new friends. Take a chance on
someone and hope they don't make you regret it.
EXT--EDGE OF THE FOREST
[The alien is moving around quietly. He goes to his dead friend,
uncovering him and taking something off of his chest.]
O'NEILL
Don't move.
[The alien turns to see O'Neill standing over him. He starts to say
something, when Pender fires at him, and he runs away instead.]
O'NEILL
Hey! Take it easy.
PENDER
We can't let it get away.
O'NEILL
I was thinking of taking it alive.
PENDER
Why would you do that?
O'NEILL
Because that's how you gain intel on an enemy you know little about!
PENDER
I know all I need to know, Colonel. Those things get a hold of you
or one of your friends, you will, too.
[He goes running after the alien.]
O'NEILL
Dammit. Teal'c.
[Teal'c chases after Pender.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
(over the radio)
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
We spotted one of the aliens, we're going after it.
INT--SHIP'S ENGINE ROOM
[The perspective shifts to Carter.]
CARTER
Roger that, sir.
CORSO
You're safe here.
CARTER
We're secure inside the ship, sir.
O'NEILL
(over the radio)
O'Neill, out.
[Carter removes her vest and jacket.]
CARTER
Don't get your hopes up; this is as far as I'm going.
CORSO
(laughing)
You know, I've been stuck on this rock with a novice navigator and a
grumpy first officer who doesn't like men. But I will attempt to
control myself.
[He looks down at Carter's zat gun.]
CORSO
Mind if I have a look?
[Carter bends down to pick it up.]
CORSO
It's interesting; it's not like your other one.
CARTER
It's a little less lethal. It's not Earth made. One shot stuns, two
shots kill.
[She puts the weapon back.]
CORSO
So, do you have anyone special back home on Earth?
CARTER
Nothing I'd care to discuss.
CORSO
All right, that's a little too interesting for me to let go.
[Carter just looks at him.]
CORSO
How about you choose a topic?
[She grins and goes back to work.]
EXT--INSIDE THE FOREST
[Teal'c, O'Neill, and Pender are searching the forest.]
PENDER
Colonel, we can cover more ground separately. Teal'c gave me one of
these, we can stay in contact.
[He shows O'Neill the radio in his hand.]
O'NEILL
All right. Not too far.
[Pender heads off.]
INT--SGC--JONAS' OFFICE
[Jonas is sitting at his desk looking at a picture, as Hammond walks
in.]
JONAS
General.
HAMMOND
I was in the area. Is there anything more?
JONAS
I was just looking for some reference on the name of the ship.
There's a slightly different spelling, but basically the same.
HAMMOND
Is it significant?
JONAS
I'm not sure.
HAMMOND
At 0625 hours there was a security breach in the main computer
system. Someone tried to gain access from a remote terminal in the
infirmary.
JONAS
You think Reynard tried to hack into it?
HAMMOND
Do you believe she's capable?
JONAS
I don't know. It's possible.
HAMMOND
Well, I'm on my way to question her about it.
JONAS
Yes, sir.
[Hammond starts to walk away.]
JONAS
General?
[Hammond pauses in the doorway, and turns around.]
JONAS
If you don't mind, I've got another idea.
EXT--INSIDE THE FOREST
[O'Neill and Teal'c come across the aliens' camp.]
O'NEILL
A little home away from home here.
TEAL'C
If the hunters used the stargate, why set up camp here?
O'NEILL
That's a pretty fair question.
[They start exploring the camp.]
TEAL'C
You also do not believe the Hebridans' story?
O'NEILL
That alien I caught sneaking around was just about to tell me
something when Pender shot him.
TEAL'C
These appear to have come from the Seberus.
[O'Neill empties what look like the alien version of dog tags out of a
bag.]
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[They hear a weapon firing.]
PENDER
(over the radio)
Colonel, I got him.
[O'Neill and Teal'c leave the camp.]
EXT--ANOTHER SPOT IN THE FOREST
[Pender is firing as Teal'c and O'Neill come running up. Teal'c stops
him.]
O'NEILL
Pender! Pender, I said alive.
[Teal'c moves off to look for the alien.]
O'NEILL
Where is he?
PENDER
He was right there.
O'NEILL
You said you had him.
PENDER
I did. I had to have hit him.
O'NEILL
T, what have you got?
TEAL'C
I believe it is blood, O'Neill.
PENDER
Told you.
INT--SHIP'S ENGINE ROOM
[Carter has crawled under a large piece of equipment.]
CARTER
There's a connection dislodged back here.
CORSO
You got it, really?
[The equipment lights up.]
CORSO
Hah!
CARTER
Only one way to find out.
CORSO
Yeah.
[Carter goes to the controls and switches them on. The room lights up.]
CORSO
Unbelievable.
CARTER
Okay, Captain, how do we boot up the system?
CORSO
Call me Aden.
CARTER
Okay.
[Corso produces a flask of alcohol.]
CORSO
You know, I've been saving this for a special occasion, we haven't
had that many around here.
CARTER
Oh, no, thanks.
CORSO
Come on.
CARTER
No, I can't, really. I'm on duty.
CORSO
All right, then I'll have one for both if us. To friendship. And to
you, Major.
[He takes a long drink.]
CARTER
You can call me Sam, that's my first name.
CORSO
Sam. It's pretty.
CARTER
Not really. It's short for Samantha.
CORSO
Even prettier. What does it mean? Samantha?
CARTER
My father wanted a boy. What about you, does your name mean
anything?
CORSO
I was named for my Uncle Aden, who died swimming drunk across a
river on a dare. And Corso, my family name, means "smells like a
dead bird" in Ancient Hebridian. Yeah, we're a real high class
family.
CARTER
Well, I'm sure they'll be overjoyed to see you again.
CORSO
Probably not.
[Carter turns away, and he continues talking to her back.]
CORSO
I've been stuck on this planet for a long time now, dreaming about
getting off of it, now suddenly I don't want to leave.
CARTER
Well, we'll stay in touch.
CORSO
I'm sure. You'll want to know about all the things we have that you
don't.
CARTER
You don't have to make it sound like that.
[She turns back to face him.]
CORSO
Like what?
CARTER
I don't know, cheap.
CORSO
Like that's not the only reason you're helping us.
CARTER
It isn't.
CORSO
You know, Sam, I've never met anyone like you before.
[She shakes her head.]
CARTER
Aden.
CORSO
Right. You should remain professional. Major.
[He leaves.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Jonas is giving Reynard a tour, with two security guards walking
behind them.]
REYNARD
This place is amazing.
JONAS
You holding up okay? Because, we could go back to the infirmary
until you're....
REYNARD
I'm fine, thanks.
[They enter Jonas' office. There are gold goblets sitting on his desk.]
JONAS
And this is where I do my work. Sorry about the clutter.
[He gathers up the goblets.]
JONAS
Just cataloguing some artefacts we found on P4X-131. It's an alpha
numeric designation we assign to the different planets we go to.
REYNARD
They're beautiful.
JONAS
Gold. Love this stuff. Tell you something, the galaxy is full of it.
[Jonas walks past Reynard and she snags his arm, spinning him around
and kissing him. He drops the goblets.]
REYNARD
Sorry.
JONAS
It's okay, I don't think that any of it is broken.
[He gathers up the goblets and puts them on a shelf.]
JONAS
Just caught me off guard.
REYNARD
I thought it was obvious.
JONAS
No. What? Huh?
REYNARD
How much I wanted to kiss you since we first met.
JONAS
That. Oh, right. That kind of obvious.
REYNARD
Look, I'm really sorry. If you don't find me attractive....
JONAS
No, look, hey you're attractive. I just, I don't know, we just met,
and you're injured, and the thought never really crossed my mind.
REYNARD
I hope you don't think this is some kind of savior complex. You
know, I fall for the guy who saved my life? Because, I thought you
were very cute way before I got shot.
[The phone rings.]
REYNARD
Are you supposed to do something about that?
JONAS
Oh yeah, right, right.
[He goes to answer it.]
JONAS
Jonas. Yes, sure, I'll be right there.
[He hangs up].</blockquote>
JONAS
It was General Hammond. He wants to see me, so if you're going to be
okay alone here for a few minutes....
REYNARD
Sure, my two friends are just out in the hall there.
JONAS
So, we'll talk more later.
REYNARD
Okay.
[Jonas leaves. When she's sure he's gone, Reynard steps over to the
computer.]
INT--INSIDE THE SHIP
[Carter is looking at a computer readout.]
CARTER
Okay, let's try a full reboot.
[She presses a button, and the screen goes blank. After a moment, a
recording appears.]
MAN

asteroid storm and thrown off course. Repeat, this is prison
transport Seberus requesting assistance. Repeat, this is prison

it.]
CARTER
Crap.
EXT--IN THE FOREST
[O'Neill is looking for Pender.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Pender? Pender, this is O'Neill. I told you to stay in visual range.
Pender, respond.
EXT--ANOTHER SPOT IN THE FOREST
[Teal'c stops, listening to noise behind him. He turns suddenly, and
holds his staff weapon on the surprised alien. O'Neill comes up behind
the alien.]
O'NEILL
All right, let's not lose our heads here.
WARRICK
I mean you no harm.
O'NEILL
You're pointing that thing at my friend's head.
[The alien slowly lowers his weapon.]
WARRICK
Please, don't shoot me. Whatever you've been told, it is a lie.
O'NEILL
Is that true?
WARRICK
I am Warrick. I am the Captain of the Seberus.
INT--INSIDE THE SHIP
[Carter comes up behind Corso, holding a zat on him.]
CARTER
Hands where I can see them.
CORSO
Sam.
CARTER
Call me Major.
[He turns around to face her.]
CORSO
Sam.
CARTER
Hands where I can see them.
CORSO
It's not what you think.
CARTER
What do I think?
CORSO
Actually, I don't know.
CARTER
This ship is a prison transport.
CORSO
Yeah, that's right.
CARTER
Sit down. Tie up your legs.
[He does.]
CORSO
I'm sorry that I lied to you but I just couldn't tell you the truth.
CARTER
Why not?
CORSO
Because I'm the reason we're here.
CARTER
I don't understand. Hands behind your back.
[She ties up his hands.]
CORSO
I allowed the prisoners to gain control of the ship. When the storm
hit us, the life support went out in the cells. They were gonna die.
CARTER
The prisoners.
CORSO
Those aliens, they didn't come through the stargate, they came here
with us. They were our prisoners. Prisoners of war.
CARTER
Your planet's at war with them?
CORSO
I let them go. We crashed before they could kill us all. It's the
honest to goodness truth, Sam. I was just too embarrassed to say
that I let that happen. We might have weathered that storm if I'd
have let them die. You have to believe me.
CARTER
Where's my radio?
CORSO
Sam.
[She leaves.]
EXT--IN THE FOREST
[Warrick is talking, while O'Neill and Teal'c have weapons trained on
him.]
WARRICK
Please, hear my side of the story before you kill me.
O'NEILL
We're not gonna kill you.
WARRICK
You shot my first officer.
[They lower their weapons.}
O'NEILL
I was just trying to wound him. And as I recall, you started things.
WARRICK
We thought we had no choice. We had to stop them from enlisting your
help.
TEAL'C
And who are they, according to you?
WARRICK
Escaped prisoners. The Seberus was a prison transport vessel. Three
years ago, my crew and I were transporting Aden Corso and two of his
accomplices to a prison colony. We hit an asteroid storm and began
to lose power. Our only hope of survival was to set down on this
planet.
O'NEILL
And then?
WARRICK
We had no choice but to take them out of transport stasis. The ship
had insufficient power to sustain their lives.
O'NEILL
How many were there.... of you?
WARRICK
My crew was eight, including myself. We watched them in shifts. My
first officer and I were looking for food and water when they
overpowered the men guarding them and killed them in cold blood.
Corso then took over the ship and used its defenses against us. We
tried many times to retake the Seberus, but recently we were just
lucky to stay alive. They hunted us like wild animals. You must
believe me. They are the worst that Hebridan has to offer. No matter
what, they must not be allowed to go free.
[O'Neill pulls out the photo he found earlier.]
O'NEILL
Who's that?
WARRICK
My wife.
O'NEILL
Your wife?
WARRICK
Athea. My kind, the Serrakin, helped liberate the Hebridan from the
Goa'uld thousands of years ago.
TEAL'C
It was your people that brought them advanced technology.
WARRICK
Since then, we have lived in harmony. With few exceptions.
CARTER
(over the radio)
Colonel, this is Carter, come in.
O'NEILL
Yeah, go.
CARTER
(over the radio)
Sir, I've got everything under control, but we need to talk. In
person.
O'NEILL
Tell me about it. Stay put, we're on our way.
EXT--OUTSIDE THE SHIP
[We switch to Carter's viewpoint.]
CARTER
Carter out.
[Pender comes up behind Carter and knocks her out.]
PENDER
My thoughts exactly.
[He takes her zat.]
EXT--THE STARGATE
[The gate activates.]
HAMMOND
(over the radio)
Major Pierce, this is General Hammond.
PIERCE
Read you loud and clear, sir.
HAMMOND
(over the radio)
I want you to hold your fire. Jonas Quinn and a guest are en route.
PIERCE
Roger that.
[Jonas and Reynard come through the gate.]
PIERCE
Colonel O'Neill, come in, sir. Jonas and Reynard have arrived back
from Earth.
[There is no reply.]
PIERCE
Must be out of range.
JONAS
We'll see him at the ship.
[He and Reynard walk past.]
EXT--INSIDE THE SHIP
[Pender finds Corso tied up.]
CORSO
They're onto us.
PENDER
Yeah, starting to get that feeling. Reynard and Jonas are on their
way back.
CORSO
Yeah, where's Carter?
PENDER
Outside, unconscious. I take it she didn't buy your story?
CORSO
Yeah, she's too smart.
[Pender unties him.]
PENDER
Had to keep trying anyway, huh?
CORSO
Yeah, I tell you, it's in my blood. She fixed the ship, though.
PENDER
It'll fly?
CORSO
Fire it up.
EXT--OUTSIDE THE SHIP
[Jonas comes over the hill and sees Carter lying on the ground,
unconscious. He runs toward her.]
JONAS
Carter!
[Corso appears and zats him.]
CORSO
(to Reynard)
We're going home.
REYNARD
Really?
CORSO
Pender's warming up the ship now.
REYNARD
You might want to reconsider that. Forget what we stashed on
Hebridan, it's nothing compared to what's through that stargate.
CORSO
What do you mean?
REYNARD
I mean, going back is not worth the risk of getting caught. Not when
there are riches out there beyond our wildest dreams. Come on, I've
learned enough to get us a good head start.
CORSO
They've got the stargate covered.
REYNARD
And we have hostages.
EXT--EDGE OF THE FOREST
[O'Neill, Teal'c, and Warrick are scouting out the ship. They see
Carter on the ground.]
WARRICK
It's a trap. No doubt they have armed the ship.
O'NEILL
We can't leave her down there.
TEAL'C
How do we disengage the ship's defenses?
WARRICK
It can only be done from inside.
O'NEILL
Cover me, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
WARRICK
I know how to disarm the defenses. I will go.
O'NEILL
We'll watch your back.
[Warrick approaches the ship, but stops when he hears the high-pitched
whine. O'Neill and Teal'c also cover their ears. Warrick stands up and
manages to get inside the ship, turning the noise off.]
[O'Neill and Teal'c go to Carter. Teal'c sits her up and pulls the tape
off her mouth.]
CARTER
They have Jonas, sir. They're gonna try to escape through the
stargate.
O'NEILL
You all right?
CARTER
A little groggy, sir.
TEAL'C
I will stay with her, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
[He heads for the stargate.]
EXT--THE STARGATE
[SG-15 is guarding the gate. Corso, Pender, and Reynard approach, with
Jonas as a hostage.]
CORSO
Hey there, guys. Why don't you put those weapons down?
[Jonas subtly waves at them to do it.]
CORSO
You best do that now, or he dies.
[They lower their weapons.]
CORSO
All we need to do is dial up the gate and go through. No one needs
to get hurt, all right?
[Jonas gives Pierce a look.]
PIERCE
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.
CORSO
That's right, whatever I say. Reynard?
[Reynard goes to the DHD and starts dialing.]
JONAS
You get that address from my lab?
REYNARD
Yeah.
JONAS
And everything else you said is a....
REYNARD
Not everything. You are cute.
[The gate opens.]
CORSO
All right, let's go.
[They head toward the open wormhole, taking Jonas with them. As they
reach the stone steps, O'Neill appears with his weapon raised.]
O'NEILL
All right, that's far enough.
[SG-15 also raise their weapons. Corso and company turn around,
brandishing their own. Pender is holding onto Jonas.]
CORSO
Don't come any closer.
PENDER
Back off or I'll kill him.
JONAS
Colonel, just let them go.
O'NEILL
Nobody's going anywhere.
JONAS
Really. I'll be fine. It's not worth the risk.
[Jonas twitches his hand, flashing the GDO and signalling that a plan
is in progress.]
O'NEILL
Let 'em go.
PIERCE
Sir?
O'NEILL
Let 'em go.
CORSO
Wise choice.
[Jonas quietly keys in the code, and they take him through the
wormhole.]
INT--SGC GATEROOM
[They exit the gate and Jonas immediately pulls away. SF's appear to
take the others into custody.]
HAMMOND
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Earth.
REYNARD
You planted the address?
JONAS
Call it intuition.
[The SF's lead them away.]
HAMMOND
Well done.
JONAS
Thank you, sir.
EXT--OUTSIDE THE SHIP
[SG-1 is helping Warrick prepare for take-off.]
O'NEILL
Everybody locked up okay?
WARRICK
They're all in transport stasis. Mr Quinn, I never did ask you how
you figured out who Reynard really was.
JONAS
Just a feeling, really. Although, I did come across something
interesting while I was researching the name of your ship. There was
another ship built by the descendents of the ancient Celts on Earth.
It was called the Ceberus. Coincidentally, it was designed
specifically to transport convicts to a penal colony. The names were
so similar, I thought that maybe there was some significance in
Celtic history and, uh....
TEAL'C
The meaning of the word never changed.
[Jonas shrugs.]
O'NEILL
Incredible.
JONAS
Well, that, and I've always been suspicious of a girl who kisses on
the first date.
[O'Neill gives him a look.]
JONAS
What?
WARRICK
Colonel, I want to thank you for everything that you have done, but
mostly for trusting me.
O'NEILL
It's my pleasure.
[Warrick nods at everyone, and enters the ship.]
