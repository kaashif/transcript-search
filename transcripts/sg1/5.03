TITLE
Ascension
TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--ALIEN WORLD (DAY)
[O'Neill and Teal'c are clambering over what appear to be the ruins of
an ancient city. They head over to where Daniel is studying a stone
pillar.]
O'NEILL
Sixteenth's coming through to set up a UAV.
TEAL'C
It appears the inhabitants of this city lost a great battle and were
destroyed long ago. There appears to be no survivors.
DANIEL
That's too bad. I was kinda hoping someone could help me decipher
this language.
O'NEILL
No idea?
DANIEL
No, that's very odd. This uh, whatever this is, is a completely
different design from the rest of the civilisation.
O'NEILL
Maybe it was here when they got here.
DANIEL
Well that's assuming the inhabitants were from another planet. I can
probably date its construction, compared to the rest of the
structures using some sort of carbon analysis.
O'NEILL
How long?
DANIEL
For what?
O'NEILL
All of it. How long?
DANIEL
Uh, well days, weeks, months, maybe...of meticulous, tedious, boring
tediousness.
[O'Neill and Teal'c walk off in separate directions.]
DANIEL
But uh, I can just keep working now. By lunch at least.
INT--CAVERN, ALIEN WORLD (DAY)
[An alien technological device is standing in the centre of the cavern.
O'Neill enters to see Carter working on a panel near the wall.]
O'NEILL
Carter? Any idea what this thing is yet?
CARTER
No, Sir, but the technology is very advanced.
O'NEILL
So what? Two hours?
CARTER
Very advanced.
O'NEILL
All right. Well Teal'c and I have secured the immediate area, we're
going to check out the town.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
O'NEILL
Don't turn it on.
[He starts to leave. Carter starts to examine the device.]
O'NEILL
Ah! What did I just say?
[Carter lifts her hands away and O'Neill leaves.]
[Once he is gone, she crouches down by a smaller device and removes a
panel, revealing crystals within.She moves over to the larger device
and starts to examine it when a wind suddenly blows through the
cavern.Something is watching her from above, but when she looks, she
doesn't see anything.As she goes back to studying the device, the alien
swoops in on her.]
EXT--ALIEN WORLD (DAY)
DANIEL
Hey, Sam, are you done with that camera yet? Sam?
[He doesn't receive any answer so he heads into the cavern. Carter is
lying unconscious on the floor and he rushes over to her to feel for a
pulse.]
DANIEL
(into his radio)
Jack, get back here. Now!
END OF TEASER
INT--INFIRMARY, SGC
[Carter is sitting on one of the infirmary beds, speaking with Dr
Fraiser.]
CARTER
Next thing you know I'm waking up with Colonel O'Neill looking down
at me. I suppose it's possible I touched something inside the
device.
FRAISER
No contact burns.
CARTER
So what do you think it was?
FRAISER
Well, people have been known to black out from fatigue.
CARTER
Come on Janet. I was a little tired but...
FRAISER
Your pre-mission blood test did show slight anaemia.
CARTER
You gave me clearance to go.
FRAISER
And I'm starting to question that judgement.
CARTER
There is nothing wrong with me.
FRAISER
Ok. At least consider what you've been through the last few years.
You've had a Tok'ra symbiote die in your brain, your memory has been
stamped, and your entire consciousness has been transferred out of
your body and into a computer and then back again and that is just
for starters. Eventually it has to take its toll.
CARTER
(smiling)
Are we done?
FRAISER
Yes.
[Carter hops down off the bed.]
FRASIER
Make sure you come back if you start speaking in an alien language.
CARTER
I'm sure I'll have no choice.
[She leaves the infirmary.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC
[O'Neill and Daniel are reporting to General Hammond, while another
man, Colonel Reynolds sits in on their discussion.]
DANIEL
Oddly the structure was built about four hundred years ago, whereas
the civilisation may date back as far as three thousand.
REYNOLDS
Why is that significant?
DANIEL
Well, it may indicate the society developed in relative isolation
and was only later influenced by something that suddenly led it to
leap to a more advanced technology.
HAMMOND
A Stargate.
DANIEL
Exactly. Which means it's likely they either discovered it or
figured out how to use it just prior to building the device. It
would seem to me that these events led to the cataclysm which ended
their society.
O'NEILL
Somehow.
DANIEL
Well, from what we know of the Goa'uld, they'll often attack a
planet that's threatening technological advancement.
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anyone say exactly what the device
is.
DANIEL
Uh, well, we're still just speculating. I mean, it could be a deep
space observatory for all I know.
O'NEILL
Or a big honkin' space gun Sir.
DANIEL
It's likely the Goa'uld would have taken that.
[Carter enters and takes a seat.]
CARTER
Well whatever it is, the power core is missing. I was able to
determine that much before I uh...
O'NEILL
Dozed off?
CARTER
The engineering of the device is extremely advanced. It's going to
take some time to decipher.
REYNOLDS
You're saying that the power core to the device is missing?
HAMMOND
Major, you know Colonel Reynolds.
CARTER
Of course.
HAMMOND
He's been transferred from Area 51 and will be leading SG16 during
its long-term analysis of the planet.
CARTER
Oh. Well, as I was saying, I believe that a naquada generator could
be modified to interface with the...
O'NEILL
(interrupting her)
Carter. 16 is on the case.
HAMMOND
Once I've heard someone conclusively tell me what the device is, I
will decide whether we should try to find a way to turn it on.
CARTER
Of course. Request permission to join SG16's assignment, Sir.
HAMMOND
Denied. Dr Jackson will be assisting in the translation of the alien
language until SG1's next mission. Otherwise, you're all free to
take some time off. Dismissed.
[They all rise and Carter heads over to Hammond.]
CARTER
Sir. With all due respect I feel fine. There's absolutely no reason
why I shouldn't be allowed to help.
HAMMOND
Major, I have no doubt that your technical expertise will be
required at some point down the line. But until Dr Fraiser advises
otherwise, I'm ordering you to take it easy.
[He heads into his office.]
CARTER
Take it easy?
O'NEILL
Yeah. You've been a little tense.
CARTER
Tense? Me? I'm not tense. Am I? (quietly)
When did you first notice?
O'NEILL
As we met.
CARTER
I've always just thought of myself as very focussed.
O'NEILL
It's called working too hard. You're going to crash and burn.
CARTER
I really don't have that much else to do, Sir.
O'NEILL
Well find something. Take up...golf. Fly a kite, knit something.
[He leaves the room.]
CARTER
(to the empty room)
I...I'm fine. Really.
EXT--STREET (DAY)
[Carter pulls up in front of her house and gets out of the car to head
inside.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE
[Carter enters her home and heads into the kitchen to check her
answering machine.]
ANSWERING MACHINE
You have no new messages.
[As Carter takes off her coat and moves around the room, the presence
from the planet is once again observing her through a white haze. It
looks around the house, sees photos on the wall.]
INT--BATHROOM (NIGHT)
[Carter is brushing her teeth. She turns away from the door, then
quickly turns back as if she senses something. There's nothing there.]
INT--BEDROOM
[The presence is watching as Carter climbs into bed and switches off
the light. It continues to watch as she sleeps.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[Carter heads down her front path to pick up her newspaper. As she
rises, a man is standing across the street, watching her.]
MAN
Hi.
CARTER
Hi.
MAN
How are you?
CARTER
Fine. How are you?
MAN
Good. Nice to meet you.
CARTER
Yeah, uh, are you from around here?
MAN
No. But this is where you live.
CARTER
(worried now)
Yes it is. I'm going to go back inside now.
MAN
See you again.
CARTER
Bye.
[She heads back into her house as the man stands there watching. She
locks the front door and looks out through the glass, but he's gone.]
[She heads into the kitchen to make a phone call.]
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE, SGC
[Daniel is heading towards his office as the phone rings. He hurries
inside to answer.]
DANIEL
Daniel Jackson.
CARTER
Hey Daniel, it's me.
DANIEL
Hi, Sam.
CARTER
I was just wondering how far you'd got on the 636 translation.
DANIEL
Oh yes, I'm almost done. It miraculously seems to hold the key to
all the mysteries of the universe.
CARTER
You just got there, you haven't started and I should leave you
alone.
DANIEL
I thought you were supposed to be taking it easy.
CARTER
Yeah, it's not so easy.
DANIEL
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I promise I'll call you when I have something.
CARTER
Ok, thanks.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE
[Carter hangs up and turns around and is shocked to see the man from
outside standing before her.]
CARTER
How did you get in here?
MAN
I won't hurt you.
CARTER
(angrily)
No, I'll hurt you if you come any closer.
[She starts to dial the phone for help.]
MAN
Please don't. I just wanna talk to you.
CARTER
About what?
MAN
It's complicated.
CARTER
Let's start with how you got into my house?
MAN
I followed you home last night.
CARTER
You've been here all night?
MAN
I read some of your books and watched the television so I could
learn how to speak and what to wear.
(He looks down at himself)
Is this ok?
CARTER
You've been in my house all night?
MAN
Yes. But you couldn't see me. I just took this form now so we could
relate. Actually, I used to look this way before my ascension.
[Carter starts to dial again.]
MAN
Please, I'm not crazy.
[She slams the phone down.]
CARTER
Who are you?
MAN
My name is Orlin. I'm from the planet you just visited. I followed
you back through the Stargate.
CARTER
See, that's impossible.
[He walks straight through the kitchen counter to stand before her.
Carter backs away.]
ORLIN
I can become invisible in my natural, non-corporeal state.
CARTER
What do you want?
ORLIN
I'm sorry if I scared you, I just wanted to talk to you. It's been
so long since I...I...I know this is going to seem...ok, I'll jut
come out and say it and then move on from there. I have these, I
guess you could call them feelings.
[Carter edges around him, then starts to run away.]
ORLIN
But the truth is...I love you.
[The front door slams as Carter runs out of the house.]
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[Men in biohazard suits are using equipment to examine Carter's house
and front garden.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[An SG engineer is fitting a camera on one of the ceilings as O'Neill
follows Carter through the house.]
O'NEILL
Looked like an ordinary guy?
CARTER
Pretty much.
O'NEILL
What was he wearing?
CARTER
Average, normal clothes.
O'NEILL
Where do you think he got 'em?
CARTER
Come on, Sir, we've seen lots of aliens before.
O'NEILL
Hammond had the surveillance tapes in the Gate room checked.
CARTER
The alien said he could become completely invisible.
O'NEILL
What else did he say?
CARTER
He just said who he was and where he was from. Believe me, Sir, at
first I thought he was just some crazy guy off the street and then
he starts walking through solid objects. I knew there was no way I
was going to be able to contain him if I tried. My phone line was
dead and I decided the best thing to do would be to bring a Code 3
team in here as fast a possible.
O'NEILL
Carter. No one's accusing you of acting improperly.
ENGINEER
Colonel, we're done. I'm ordering my men to evacuate the premises.
O'NEILL
All right, notify the local authorities and tell them the gas leak
is fixed.
ENGINEER
Yes, Sir. Our remote surveillance system is set up and can be
monitored from down the street. We'll watch the place as long as you
want, Sir.
O'NEILL
Thanks.
(To Carter)
Uh, I could hang out for a while.
CARTER
So far he's only shown himself to me.
O'NEILL
Maybe he's shy.
CARTER
Please don't say take it easy.
O'NEILL
Take care?
[She smiles and nods, and he leaves.]
[Through a camera on the wall, Carter is seen moving around her house,
going through a chest of drawers in the bedroom, closing the front door
of her house, talking on the phone in the kitchen.]
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE, SGC
[Teal'c is working on a laptop, Daniel reading some papers. O'Neill
enters.]
DANIEL
How's Sam?
O'NEILL
Absolutely no evidence of her secret friend.
[Daniel looks up.]
DANIEL
How's Sam?
O'NEILL
Hammond recommended a psyche evaluation.
TEAL'C
Do you believe Major Carter has become mentally unstable?
O'NEILL
No more than the rest of us. What have you guys got?
DANIEL
Well, it looks like that thing on 636 is a weapon.
O'NEILL
I was right?
TEAL'C
It is a weapon of great power O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Big and honkin'.
DANIEL
From what I've been able to decipher the people on 636 were
developing along a similar technological time line to Earth. They
had just discovered their STARGATE when what they called the threat
from the skies came.
O'NEILL
Goa'ulds.
DANIEL
Yet somehow they suddenly managed to build themselves an incredibly
advanced weapon to defend themselves.
O'NEILL
Couldn't have been so advanced. The place was a disaster, it
obviously didn't work.
DANIEL
Well actually it did. The monument outside the device tells the
story of how they destroyed the threat from the skies and the men
who built the weapon were heroes.
TEAL'C
Which would explain why the Goa'uld did not take the weapon.
O'NEILL
Hey, I saw that planet. If the Goa'uld didn't get them, who did?
DANIEL
We're not sure.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Carter enters her sitting room and switches on a light. Orlin is
sitting behind her.]
ORLIN
I understand why you did it.
CARTER
Of course you wait until they took the cameras away.
ORLIN
Military protocol. You would have jeopardised your job if you didn't
report me.
CARTER
I just came from a psychological evaluation. Do you understand what
that means?
ORLIN
They think you're crazy.
CARTER
Am I?
ORLIN
There were times on Velona where I thought I might be losing my
mind.
CARTER
Velona.
ORLIN
Your planet refers to it as 636. I was there for hundreds of years
by myself. The first time I saw you...
CARTER
Look...
ORLIN
Please. Let me finish. My kind are capable of a level of
communication that shares our innermost essence.
CARTER
Telepathy.
ORLIN
Reading someone's mind is an invasion of privacy. It's not about
specific thoughts or memory. It's a sort of...exchange of spirit.
CARTER
So you did this sharing thing on me.
ORLIN
Unfortunately, you passed out. I guess you weren't prepared. But I
did learn about you.
CARTER
What did you learn?
ORLIN
That you're a good person, that your heart is pure, that on the
inside your spirit is as beautiful as you are on the outside.
CARTER
(exasperated)
All right.
[She gets to her feet.]
ORLIN
Where are you going?
CARTER
To get the Code 3 team back in here.
ORLIN
I'll just hide again.
CARTER
So what are you going to do? Stalk me for the rest of my life?
ORLIN
Actually, I just wanted you to let me try again. I think a human can
handle it. I think you have to just be...well, receptive.
CARTER
Then will you go to the SGC and turn yourself in?
ORLIN
No. But I'll leave if you want.
CARTER
Will you actually be gone?
ORLIN
I promise.
CARTER
Ok. What do I do?
ORLIN
(rising)
Stand there. Open your mind to the possibility of an existence not
governed by the rules of science which you hold so dear.
CARTER
How do I do that?
ORLIN
Just close your eyes and...
CARTER
Don't say take it easy.
ORLIN
Relax.
[She takes a breath, then closes her eyes. Orlin begins to glow
brightly, losing his human form as he does so. The light surrounds both
him and Carter, before dissipating.]
[Carter opens her eyes and stares at Orlin.]
CARTER
Oh my god.
INT--CORRIDOR, SGC
[Carter, in civilian clothing, quickly catches up with O'Neill.]
CARTER
Colonel!
O'NEILL
Yep?
CARTER
Sir, look at this.
[She shows him a clock, with a camera hidden inside.]
O'NEILL
So?
CARTER
So, it was in my house. The Code3 team were supposed to take away
all their equipment when they left, no more cameras, no more
listening devices.
O'NEILL
So they forgot one Carter.
CARTER
Are you sure?
O'NEILL
No.
[They stop outside a room.]
CARTER
Sir. Is the SGC secretly keeping tabs on me?
O'NEILL
Secretly?
CARTER
Colonel, I did my duty in reporting the alien encounter and now
everyone thinks I'm crazy.
O'NEILL
Look, Carter, here's the bottom line. No one has seen what you've
seen and until that happens we're all going to think you're nuts.
CARTER
Sir, purely hypothetically, as my superior office, if this alien did
show himself to me again...
O'NEILL
Did it?
CARTER
I'm just saying if the alien had the ability and desire to show
himself only to me, it would probably be better if I gathered as
much information as I could, possibly even found a way of isolating
it, before I officially mentioned it again. Right?
O'NEILL
Probably. Yes. I got to pee.
[He goes into the bathroom.]
CARTER
Yes Sir.
INT--CARTER'S LAB, SGC
[Carter is sitting at the computer when Daniel enters.]
DANIEL
That's the last of it.
CARTER
Thanks.
DANIEL
What are you working on?
CARTER
Well, based on your translation and SG16's latest report, the
Pentagon has started putting pressure on General Hammond to try to
find a way to activate the weapon.
DANIEL
You think that's going to be possible?
CARTER
Well yeah. A naquada reactor can be interfaced easily enough. The
problem is the burst of energy that's required makes the whole thing
pretty dangerous.
DANIEL
How?
CARTER
Well, basically you have to start an overload in the reactor and
then release it into the device. The problem is, once the overload
is started, you have no choice but to release the energy or the
reactor will explode.
DANIEL
So you'd better be sure you want the weapon to fire.
CARTER
Yep. I'm working on a way to try to buffer the energy in a safer
environment prior to the release but General Hammond hasn't given me
much time.
DANIEL
By all accounts, this device on 636 is a pretty powerful weapon.
CARTER
You think we should just leave it alone?
DANIEL
Well, let's just say I'd feel better if there was someone left to
explain how to use it.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[Carter enters her house to find Orlin waiting for her.]
ORLIN
You're late.
CARTER
What do you mean?
ORLIN
You said you'd be home an hour ago. I was worried.
CARTER
Hey, this is not a relationship we have going here. I don't even
know what it is.
ORLIN
You still could have called.
CARTER
What are you talking about? You couldn't even answer the phone if I
did.
ORLIN
Maybe I could have.
[Carter looks around and sees the table set with candles and flowers.]
CARTER
How did...? I mean, I thought.
[She touches his shoulder.]
ORLIN
Surprise.
CARTER
How?
ORLIN
Things have been going well between us, right?
CARTER
There is no us, Orlin. I don't see how there ever could be.
ORLIN
That was just because we used to live on different planes of
existence.
CARTER
Used to?
ORLIN
It's possible for my kind to take human form. Actually, re-take
human form, considering this is the way we started.
[The doorbell rings.]
CARTER
Oh boy.
O'NEILL
(from outside)
Carter!
CARTER
It's Colonel O'Neill. Disappear.
[The doorbell rings again.]
ORLIN
That's what I was trying to tell you. I can't anymore.
[O'Neill starts knocking on the door, so Carter grabs Orlin and pushes
him into a closet, closing the door.]
[She answers the front door to find O'Neill and TEAL'C, in a cowboy
hat, waiting for her.]
CARTER
Hey guys, what are you doing here?
O'NEILL
We brought pizzas and a movie.
TEAL'C
Star Wars.
O'NEILL
He's seen it, what? Eight times?
TEAL'C
Nine.
O'NEILL
Nine times. If Teal'c likes it, it's got to be ok.
CARTER
You've never seen Star Wars?
O'NEILL
Well, you know me and sci-fi. Come on, we never just get to hang
out, so I thought we'd...
CARTER
Uh, Sir, as much as I, ah...
[She glances back inside the house.]
O'NEILL
Carter. Do you...already have company?
CARTER
Kind of.
O'NEILL
A date?
CARTER
I can understand why you might assume that I didn't have plans.
O'NEILL
Don't worry about it. We'll find something else to do.
CARTER
I'm really sorry, I mean this is a surprise, very unexpected.
O'NEILL
Well good for you. Have fun.
CARTER
Thank you.
O'NEILL
Have a pizza...and fun.
[He gives her the pizza and he and Teal'c leave.]
[Carter opens the closet door.]
ORLIN
As I was saying, once my kind chooses to take human form, we can't
ascend again without the help of the others.
EXT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking away from the house.]
O'NEILL
So, now what?
TEAL'C
I have read of a place where humans do battle in a ring of Jell-O.
O'NEILL
Call Daniel.
[They get in O'Neill's car and drive off.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE
[Orlin and Carter are talking over the meal Orlin prepared.]
ORLIN
I don't know where the rest of my kind are.
CARTER
Well, believe it or not, we met one of them. Her name was Oma
Desala.
ORLIN
Really. Never heard of her.
CARTER
She could do the same glowy kind of things that you can and she
controlled the forces of Nature.
ORLIN
Yeah, that's easy. At least it used to be.
CARTER
Well she lived on a planet called Kheb and she helped people ascend
to a higher plane of existence.
ORLIN
That's why I've never heard of her. She was probably banished, like
me.
CARTER
What for?
ORLIN
Breaking one of the most sacred rules of our kind: Do not accelerate
the natural ascension process of those beneath. The humans of Velona
were under attack from the Goa'uld. I was prohibited from
interfering, but I couldn't just watch them die.
CARTER
You told them how to build the weapon.
ORLIN
Communicated the knowledge, yes. They saved themselves.
CARTER
But not for long.
ORLIN
No.
CARTER
Well, you were right to try.
ORLIN
You're wrong. It was a horrible mistake. Shortly after they used the
weapon to defend themselves, they started to plan the conquest of
other planets using the technology that I gave them.
CARTER
So what happened?
ORLIN
The others.
CARTER
The others of your kind destroyed the planet? Well, they interfered
too, isn't that breaking their own rule.
ORLIN
As a collective, they decided it was necessary to prevent a disaster
that I was responsible for. I was forced to live on Velona after
that as my punishment.
CARTER
You couldn't have known.
ORLIN
That's why the rule exists.
CARTER
So. What now?
ORLIN
I'm human. Mortal, like you. I can never go back to the way I was
without the others.
CARTER
Why would you do this?
ORLIN
I did it as much for myself as for you.
INT--VAN, OUTSIDE CARTER'S HOUSE
[Two men inside the van are monitoring Carter and Orlin inside the
house.]
ORLIN
(through listening device)
If nothing develops between us, I'll accept it. I just couldn't go
on any other way. I just had to know.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM, SGC
REYNOLDS
One week should be more than enough time to run the proper pre-test
simulation.
[He glances towards Colonel Simmons, who is sitting opposite SG1.]
CARTER
Sirs, if I may. I think we should wait.
SIMMONS
You think we should wait? Major, you're the one who figured out how
to use the naquada reactor to power this device.
CARTER
Because General Hammond ordered me to. And if you read my
recommendations, you'll see I also said it's extremely dangerous.
SIMMONS
Well I did read your recommendation and the Pentagon feels the risks
are worth the reward.
REYNOLDS
Going through the Stargate is extremely dangerous and you do that
everyday.
DANIEL
I agree with Sam; we don't know enough about what happened on that
planet yet.
SIMMONS
Need I remind you, Dr Jackson, of the dangers that we're trying to
defend Earth against.
DANIEL
Oh, could you? Go slow.
CARTER
General, I believe that using the device caused an atmospheric
weather anomaly big enough to destroy the civilisation on 636.
DANIEL
You do?
SIMMONS
That wasn't in your report.
HAMMOND
Do you have any evidence Major?
CARTER
Not exactly. But I think that we need to perform a proper forensic
environmental analysis.
REYNOLDS
We're going to. After the first test firing of the weapon which is
when we'll be able to gather the most accurate information.
CARTER
Not if you're dead.
REYNOLDS
There is nothing to show...
HAMMOND
(cutting him off)
Major, you have two weeks to bring in any relevant evidence. If you
can present a good reason to stop the test, I will. Dismissed.
[Simmons approaches Hammond.]
SIMMONS
General. Need I remind you, that ultimately the decision rests with
the Pentagon.
HAMMOND
Colonel, there's a red phone in my office that only takes calls from
one man. The last time I checked, he's the boss of your boss. Or do
I need to remind you?
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (DAY)
[Carter enters her house.]
CARTER
Orlin?
ORLIN
Sam, I'm glad you're home. I made something for you.
[He hands her something wrapped in a cloth. She opens it to find a
large emerald.]
CARTER
Is this real?
ORLIN
I read about how humans associate certain materials with their birth
month. Yours is emerald right?
CARTER
It's huge.
ORLIN
Oh. Is it? It was difficult to tell the common size from the
pictures in the book.
CARTER
You made it?
ORLIN
You wouldn't believe the things that you can make from the common,
simple items lying around your planet. Which reminds me, you're
going to need a new microwave.
CARTER
Orlin, I need to talk to you about something else.
ORLIN
Ok.
CARTER
Let's take a walk.
EXT--PARK (DAY)
[Orlin and Carter are walking through the park.]
ORLIN
The others will know if the weapon is activated.
CARTER
You think they'll try to stop us?
ORLIN
It's possible.
CARTER
What, even if we only intend to use the weapon to defend ourselves?
ORLIN
How can you be sure of your people's intentions? You obviously can't
trust them if you think that they would spy on you inside of your
own house.
CARTER
Yeah, I guess I can't trust all of them.
ORLIN
I've read some of your recent history.
CARTER
And?
ORLIN
Many of the creators of the first atom bomb honestly believed it
would only be used to maintain peace. I can't take the chance, Sam.
I won't be responsible for the demise of another civilisation.
CARTER
Well if you thought it might come to that, why didn't you just
destroy the weapon?
ORLIN
I thought I had. I never expected you to be able to replace the
power core. You really are brilliant.
CARTER
I think your point is, we have to find a way to stop the test.
ORLIN
How? You have no proof without exposing me.
CARTER
I know.
[He starts to smile.]
CARTER
What?
ORLIN
I'm sorry. If you haven't turned me in by now, there must be a
reason.
CARTER
I'd feel bad betraying you. That's all, nothing more.
ORLIN
You like me.
CARTER
Orlin.
ORLIN
You like me. I can tell. You like me a lot.
[Carter smiles despite herself.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE, SGC
[Carter enters Hammond's office to find O'Neill and Simmons waiting for
her.]
O'NEILL
They're testing the weapon.
HAMMOND
I received an order directly from the President. Colonel Reynolds
and SG16 are on P4X 636, setting up the naquada reactor as we speak.
CARTER
But, Sir, you said I would have two weeks, it's only been...
SIMMONS
Nine days, Major. And I dare say you haven't spent a single minute
of it working on atmospheric weather anomalies.
CARTER
What's that supposed to mean?
SIMMONS
Would you like to explain these deliveries?
CARTER
What deliveries?
SIMMONS
(reading from a report)
100 pounds of raw titanium. 200 feet of fibre optic cable. Seven
100, 000 watt industrial strength capacitors. The list goes on. All
ordered on line from your home computer.
[He hands her the sheet of paper.]
CARTER
I have no idea what you're talking about, I've been here on the base
everyday.
SIMMONS
Oh, well then maybe you'd like to explain who's been excepting these
deliveries.
[He shows her photos of her and Orlin, taken from outside her house.]
CARTER
(shocked)
You have been watching me.
HAMMOND
Not us. The Pentagon. I'm sorry Major. I've expressed my anger and
disappointment to the resident regarding the investigation of one of
my officers without my knowledge.
SIMMONS
We have tapes of your conversation with the alien.
O'NEILL
At least we know there is one now for sure.
SIMMONS
Would you like to tell us what's going on Major?
O'NEILL
She doesn't have to tell you squat. Major Carter was working with
the approval of her superior officer. She told me he was there. I
authorised her to collect as much information as possible.
SIMMONS
I'm not here to lay blame, Colonel. I'm here as a courtesy.
(To Carter)
As we speak a team of Special Forces are surrounding your house and
on my command, they're going to go in and take that alien into
custody.
EXT--OUTSIDE CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Special Forces are in position outside Carter's house. A car pulls up
and Simmons, Carter and O'Neill get out.]
SIMMONS
What's going on?
SOLDIER
Well the suspect is in there, but he's failing to respond to our
call to surrender.
O'NEILL
Let Carter go in. He's worth more to you alive, right?
SIMMONS
Yeah.
O'NEILL
You've got the place sealed off, he's not going anywhere. Let Carter
go in and try to bring him out.
SIMMONS
All right. Give her a radio.
[A soldier gives Carter a radio and she heads over to her house.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Carter enters her home. It's dark and she has a flashlight.]
CARTER
Orlin? Orlin?
ORLIN
(from below)
Sam? Come on down.
[She descends into the basement to find him fiddling with the fuse
box.]
CARTER
Orlin, what are you doing?
ORLIN
Ok, just a minute.
CARTER
There's a team of Special Forces outside.
ORLIN
I know.
CARTER
They wanna take you into custody.
ORLIN
I know. It's ok.
CARTER
Orlin, I didn't turn you in.
ORLIN
I didn't think you did.
[He does something to the fuse box, causing sparks, then grabs her hand
and pulls her into another room.]
ORLIN
Come on.
[They enter the other room to find a small Stargate in the middle.]
CARTER
Whoa. You've been busy.
ORLIN
I didn't think they'd let me go back to Velona through their
Stargate.
CARTER
So you built one?
ORLIN
Sort of. This won't dial multiple addresses and will only create a
wormhole once and probably burn out.
CARTER
And you ordered the materials on line.
ORLIN
Mostly. Sorry, but you're going to have a pretty big credit card
bill this month. Oh, and you're going to need a new toaster. I
tapped into the main power line. Hopefully we'll be able to draw
enough energy.
CARTER
And then what?
ORLIN
I go to Velona to stop your people from using the weapon.
CARTER
You know they won't listen to you. They have orders.
ORLIN
Then I'll have to make them listen.
CARTER
They could kill you.
SIMMONS
(over the radio)
Major Carter. Major Carter, report. Major Carter, respond
immediately.
[She holds the radio, but doesn't respond.]
EXT--OUTSIDE CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
SIMMONS
(into his radio)
Carter.
O'NEILL
(into the radio)
Carter, what are you doing?
SIMMONS
(to the soldiers)
Move in.
SOLDIER
All teams, all teams, we have a Code Red.
O'NEILL
(to Carter, over the radio)
We're coming in.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Carter can hear the order given over the radio.]
SOLDIER
(over her radio)
Go, go, go.
ORLIN
I was really hoping that there would be another way.
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[The Special Forces soldiers enter the house, kicking in the doors.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[Orlin triggers the power to his mini Stargate and it's enough to
create a wormhole through to Velona.]
ORLIN
You know how I feel about you. I hope this isn't goodbye.
[He runs and jumps thought the Stargate while Carter looks on.]
[She hears the approach of the soldiers.]
INT--CARTER'S HOUSE (NIGHT)
[O'Neill and the soldiers enter the small room to see the small
Stargate shut down. There's no sign of Carter.]
EXT--VELONA (DAY)
[Orlin is running away from the Stargate, Carter a few hundred yards
behind.]
CARTER
Orlin!
[Orlin looks up to see the sky ominously clouding over.]
INT--CAVERN, VELONA
[Colonel Reynolds and his team are working on the device.]
[Orlin comes in and attacks one man, pushing him down and grabbing his
zat gun. He shoots the downed soldier but Reynolds draws his side arm
and points it at him.]
REYNOLDS
Don't move!
EXT--VELONA
[Carter is running towards the cavern when she hears a shot being
fired.]
CARTER
(running into the cavern)
Hold your fire! I know this man.
[Behind her, Orlin has been shot, but is still on his feet.]
REYNOLDS
He attacked us.
[The device in the cavern is starting to build up power.]
CARTER
Colonel please. Lower your weapon. He has good reason to wanna stop
this test.
REYNOLDS
I-I have orders from General Hammond.
CARTER
I know. Let's just dial out and talk to the General about it.
REYNOLDS
Can't do that. Your instructions specifically said that once we
started the energy build up, we couldn't abort or the reactor will
blow.
CARTER
(to Orlin)
He's right. If we disconnect the reactor now, it will explode.
ORLIN
Good. The weapon will be destroyed.
REYNOLDS
I can't let that happen, Major.
[Orlin dives forward and Reynolds opens fire, but he manages to
disconnect the cables to the device in a shower of sparks.]
[The device begins to lose power and goes dead.]
[Carter rushes over to Orlin, who has been shot several times.]
ORLIN
I can't believe how much this hurts.
CARTER
Just hang on.
REYNOLDS
Major, we got to get out of here.
CARTER
We can dial out. We can't risk the blast translating through the
wormhole.
ORLIN
I have to go, Sam.
(He touches her face)
They've given me another chance. It's the only way I can save you.
[He starts to glow and the hand touching her face slips away into the
light as he moves away from her. He passes over the naquada reactor, to
the shock of Colonel Reynolds, and takes it high into the sky where it
explodes in a massive blast. The others all duck as a lightning bolt
shoots down and destroys the device for good. Carter slowly raises
herself to look up at the sky through the gap in the cavern and see
clouds begin to clear.]
FADE OUT
THE END
