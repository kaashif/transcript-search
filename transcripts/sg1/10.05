[Mitchell is firing into the forest, alone.]
MITCHELL
(to himself)
Where the hell are they?
[He turns and a Sodan warrior, Volnek, hits him in the face with the
handle end of a small staff weapon. Mitchell falls to the ground.]
EXCERPTS FROM 10.04 "INSIDERS"
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
BARETT
We've been investigating the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust for
two years now. I'm telling you, it's a global conspiracy.
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM, LEVEL 16
BARRETT
What are you guys saying? You think that I've been brainwashed.
TEAL'C
The technology is readily available to the Goa'uld who infiltrated
the Trust.

TEASER
EXT--DRIVEWAY TO O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[The small log cabin is situated in a pine forest. The driveway is
hard-packed but muddy dirt. Smoke is coming from the chimney of the
cabin, and Landry stands on the front porch wearing jeans and a blue
plaid shirt. Mitchell arrives in a black, 1965 Ford Mustang fastback.
The engine noise is loud and throaty. He pulls up almost to the cabin
and stops.]
LANDRY
(stepping toward Mitchell's car)
You made good time, Colonel.
[Mitchell opens the car door and leans out. He is wearing a brown
leather jacket.]
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. Well it's a good thing I left early. I took a wrong turn
at the Post Office and was driving about an hour before my Special
Forces training kicked in, and I realized I was lost. That, and the
road ended.
[He gets out of the car as Landry steps up to it.]
LANDRY
Wiser men than you have done worse.
MITCHELL
(looking at cabin)
So this is General O'Neill's place.
LANDRY
Actually, Jack hasn't been able to use it much now that he spends of
lot of time in Washington.
MITCHELL
His loss.
LANDRY
(gesturing with his arm)
Come on in.
MITCHELL
(reaching for his bags inside the car)
Looks like I beat the others up here.
LANDRY
Walter just called. Colonel Reynolds' team's been delayed off-world.
Teal'c's gone to assist.
[Mitchell stops what he's doing and stands up to face Landry.]
MITCHELL
(concerned)
Is there a problem?
LANDRY
Nothing they can't handle. Unfortunately it also means that Colonel
Carter will be delayed until Reynolds gets back to take command of
the SGC.
MITCHELL
What about Jackson?
LANDRY
Still in England. Seems he's met some Lord or Earl with a private
library of ancient reference material on Merlin and Morgan Le Fay.
(chuckling)
He's obviously quite excited.
MITCHELL
(laughing)
Yeah, like a fat kid in a candy store.
LANDRY
(serious)
I was a big boy, in my youth. Never did appreciate comments like
that.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. Sorry sir.
[Mitchell looks away for a moment as if he is dreading the rest of his
stay.]
LANDRY
Anyway, Vala's hitching a ride with the others, so until then, it's
just you and me.
MITCHELL
I'll be sure to stay out of your way, sir. You won't even know I'm
here.
[Mitchell takes his duffel bag from the car and closes the door. They
begin walking to the cabin.]
LANDRY
Nonsense. Getting to know each other a little better outside of work
and the pressure of the SGC is what this is all about. Kick back.
Put our feet up for the day.
[He pats Mitchell on the shoulder.]
MITCHELL
Well, that's kind of hard to do with the fate of the galaxy hanging
in the balance, sir.
LANDRY
(stopping to face him)
Well, if anyone's going to make a difference in this battle,
Colonel, it's you and your team.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. I see what you mean about escaping the pressure.
LANDRY
We all need to stop for air now and then. We'll burn out. That's the
one thing you people don't know how to do. So, I'm making it an
order.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. I'm sure it'll be fun, sir.
LANDRY
You're damn right it'll be fun!
[Landry walks toward the door. Mitchell pauses for a moment, smiling
uncomfortably. Landry opens the door]
LANDRY
Come on in.
[From the nearby woods, someone watches the scene. Their color vision
is skewed toward the blue colors, similarly to Volnek's when he was
using the Sodan cloaking shield.]
LANDRY
I've got the coffee on.
EXT--P9J-333, DAY
[The planet is forested, with a very large, molten moon above the
horizon.]
EXT--FOREST ON P9J-333, DAY
[Teal'c and Col. Reynolds are walking through the forest.]
REYNOLDS
The first villager went missing sometime yesterday morning. Then
another by nightfall. They sent out search parties, armed men. These
people are capable hunters. By all accounts they've lived on this
planet for generations and never encountered an animal they
perceived as an unmanageable threat.
[The come upon other members of SG-3.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps it was not an animal.
[Teal'c is shocked to see three bodies torn to pieces on the ground.]
REYNOLDS
So if an animal didn't tear these people apart, what did?

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter is at the head of the table, with Teal'c and Vala to her left
and Reynolds to her right.]
TEAL'C
The people of P9J-333 have never before encountered an indigenous
creature they believe capable of such an act.
CARTER
(to Reynolds)
You think this is some sort of motivational tool meant to strike
fear -- an Ori boogey man?
REYNOLDS
It seems to be working. People are terrified.
CARTER
Any chance the Prior knew you were there?
REYNOLDS
I doubt this was a message directed at us. Our mission was to
covertly observe if the planet went Origin or not. We didn't make
contact with the population until after people started going
missing.
CARTER
Okay. Well, if this is some new Ori threat, chances are the Prior
will show up to take responsibility.
VALA
On the other hand, if it's not and it's just some vicious creature
hellbent on eating the whole village, shouldn't we use our superior
technology to help track it down?
[Carter looks at her questioningly.]
VALA
You think I don't really care about the plight of some innocent
people I've never met on some planet somewhere.
CARTER
I'm sorry. But, uh, yes.
VALA
It just so happens I have vast experience hunting rare deadly
creatures of all kinds.
CARTER
(smiling in accusation)
Ah. let me guess: the rarer they are...
VALA
Please. I am here to be helpful. If you don't think these boys can
use my expertise, that's fine. I'll just stay here, and we can start
on that quality time General Landry wanted us to spend together.
[Carter's face falls, as if this is the last thing she wants.]
VALA
(falsely innocent)
I've actually come up with a list of suggestions.
CARTER
(perking up)
Teal'c, you and Vala head to 333 with SG's 3 and 25. See if you can
figure out what we're dealing with without being detected by the
locals.
VALA
(slapping Teal'c on the arm with both hands)
Good plan, boss!
CARTER
Vala's experience notwithstanding, I want everyone to exercise
extreme caution. We should find out whether this is Prior-related or
not.
[Reynolds nods.]
TEAL'C
Is General Landry not expecting us at his cabin?
CARTER
(smiling a bit falsely)
I'll let him know we're going to be delayed a little bit.
VALA
Oh, I'm sure Colonel Mitchell will be very pleased to hear he's got
more special alone time with the General.
[Carter chuckles ironically then stands and walks out.]
TEAL'C
(calling after her)
Colonel.
[Reynolds gets up and leaves.]
VALA
(grabbing his arm again)
Hey, if this is a rare and deadly creature, we have to try and catch
it alive. Okay?
[As she speaks, Teal'c sighs in irritation.]
TEAL'C
(standing)
That is not our mission.
VALA
Do you have any idea what this could be worth on the open market?
TEAL'C
(walking out)
I do not.
[Vala rushes around Teal'c to catch him.]
VALA
(grabbing his arm)
Okay, okay, wait. I propose a fifty-fifty split. I think it's only
fair. I'm the one with all the contacts to unload something like
this. Anything less than that would just be, well, plain wrong.
[Teal'c opens his mouth to speak, but thinks better of it and walks
away.]
VALA
(calling after him)
Okay, name your price. Well, say something. It's called negotiating!
[She follows him out.]
EXT--PORCH OF O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Mitchell is dressed in an Air Force sweatshirt and jeans. He is
sitting on a rustic bench on the front porch, working on a laptop.]
MITCHELL
They're not coming.
[Landry hangs up his portable phone then leans over to pull two beers
out of the cooler and hands one to Mitchell, who barely looks up from
the computer.]
LANDRY
Uh, something is eating people on P9J-333. Teal'c and Vala are
checking it out.
MITCHELL
(looking at Landry)
Really? Maybe I should--
LANDRY
At ease, Colonel. They've got SG-3 and 5 with them. They'll be fine.
MITCHELL
Still, this was supposed to be a group thing, sir. Maybe we should
reschedule--
LANDRY
And put away that laptop. You can't possibly still be writing
mission reports.
[Mitchell closes the laptop.]
LANDRY
And if you are, I don't want to read anything that long!
MITCHELL
Yeah, to be honest, sir, I finished an hour ago.
LANDRY
I thought so. You don't have to be so uncomfortable around me,
Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Sir, no matter what, you're still my boss.
LANDRY
I just wish you'd relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of the great
outdoors.
[Mitchell swats an insect on his neck. He looks up in shock at the
sound of a rifle firing not far away.]
LANDRY
Ignore it.
MITCHELL
(alert)
That was a large caliber. Three hundred or three three eight.
LANDRY
They're hunting elk. It's one of the only drawbacks around here.
MITCHELL
Not a fan, sir?
LANDRY
Well, running around the woods with a gun never seemed to me like a
good way to unwind. Looking to kill some innocent creature just
going about its day...
MITCHELL
No, I suppose not, sir. Not if your day job involves running around
the woods, carrying a gun.
EXT--FOREST ON P9J-333, DAY
[Teal'c, Vala, and Reynolds are searching the forest, moving quickly.
Reynolds and Teal'c carry large machine guns, while Vala carries a
P-90. They pause to examine a large animal footprint in the mud. Other
SGC personnel are on alert nearby.]
REYNOLDS
Recognize the tracks?
TEAL'C
I do not.
VALA
What we need to do first is dig a deep pit.
[She stands up and moves to the nearby clearing. Reynolds sighs while
Teal'c gives her a sidelong glance.]
VALA
This looks like a very good spot.
(to the nearby SGC members)
Why don't you boys get started.
[One soldier looks at another and shakes his head at her, but doesn't
comply.]
VALA
What?
(turning back to Teal'c and Reynolds)
Don't tell me you didn't bring shovels!
[There is an animal moaning sound not far away, followed by automatic
gunfire and men screaming.]
SG-25 LEADER
(over radio)
This is SG-25 leader. We need--
[His words are cut off by more screaming. Teal'c and the others begin
running toward the sounds. Teal'c pauses, hearing something else. He
turns in a different direction, moving out alone. Reynolds and Vala go
to the SG-25 Leader, who is wounded, with large scratches across his
chest. Reynolds tries to stop the bleeding with bandages.]
SG-25 LEADER
It came out of nowhere. Never seen anything like it.
[Nearby, Teal'c moves cautiously. Another soldier appears from behind a
tree, aiming at Teal'c. Teal'c holds up a hand to stop him from
shooting. The soldier is wounded, his left arm torn.]
TEAL'C
(going to him)
Remain calm. You will be fine.
[They hear a savage growl. Teal'c grabs the soldier by the vest.]
TEAL'C
Come.
[They move away.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[It is a dark and stormy night.]
INT--O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Landry and Mitchell are playing chess at a small table.]
LANDRY
Check-mate.
MITCHELL
Yep. Too good for me, sir.
[He knocks over his King in surrender and takes a swig of his beer.]
LANDRY
Pandering to the ego of a senior officer, Mitchell?
MITCHELL
No, truthfully, I always hated the game. But if you happen to have a
Playstation, I will happily kick your ass at SOCOM 3.
LANDRY
Good. I want you to feel like you can be honest with me.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
But I suppose that's easier for me than it is for you. I am the
General.
MITCHELL
No, I think it's probably harder for you in some ways.
LANDRY
Oh, lonely at the top and all that, huh?
MITCHELL
No, more not knowing what people think of your decisions.
[Landry laughs.]
LANDRY
Relax, son. I was uh, I was thinking about what you said to me last
week, about not being in charge of anything.
MITCHELL
I'm just used to a clearer chain of command.
LANDRY
You could have picked any team you wanted. You chose to make it your
personal mission to get Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson, and Teal'c
back together.
MITCHELL
That's true, and I wouldn't change that for the world.
LANDRY
You said you wanted to learn from the very best.
MITCHELL
Yes, I did. It's just... after almost dying, like I did, there was a
part of me that figured... I could do anything. Well, since coming
to the SGC, I have learned that I can't handle any of this without
the rest of SG-1.
LANDRY
I believe in you, Colonel.
MITCHELL
Thank you, sir.
[Landry becomes more intense, speaking over Mitchell.]
LANDRY
But we're getting our asses kicked.
MITCHELL
Yes we are.
LANDRY
We're not going to get medals for participation.
MITCHELL
No, sir.
LANDRY
We win, or we die.
MITCHELL
I prefer winning.
LANDRY
And you started by bringing SG-1 back together. I need you to
continue working together if we're going to have any hope. Your job
is to make sure that happens.
MITCHELL
(nodding)
Very good, sir.
[The look at each other in an assessing way, continuing to sip their
beers.]
EXT--FOREST ON P9J-333, DAY
[Vala is running from the woods into a clearing in which the Stargate
and DHD sit. She runs to the DHD and begins dialing. She hears a long,
low growl and stops. She turns around in place, searching for the
source of the sound.]
VALA
(quietly)
Okay, you want some dessert? Come and get it!
[She raises her weapon at a sound and is about to fire when she
realizes it is Teal'c emerging from the bushes.]
VALA
Ah, you could have warned me. I nearly shot you!
TEAL'C
Then you should not have run off by yourself.
VALA
I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself.
(gesturing to the DHD)
I was trying to get help.
TEAL'C
Then why are you not dialing the gate?
[Teal'c walks over to the DHD.]
VALA
Because I thought I heard something growling.
TEAL'C
(after a moment)
I hear nothing.
VALA
It's probably because you scared it away. That's good. Now we can--
[Something growls very loudly, and Vala starts firing at it with her
P-90. The creature advances on them, its vision tinted toward the blue.
Teal'c pulls out a hand grenade and throws it at the creature. As the
grenade explodes, he grabs Vala and throws her to the ground, landing
face to face on top of her. Her arms are around him, and his hand is
cradling her head. Debris falls around them, and they look back toward
the creature. Then, realizing their positions, they look at each
other.]
VALA
Well, I'm flattered, but I don't think we have time for this.
TEAL'C
(quietly)
Are you injured?
VALA
No, I'm fine.
[He helps her to stand up.]
VALA
Ah, thank you.
[They walk over to the creature, which is clearly dead, its large
carcass smoking.]
VALA
So much for taking it alive. Shame, too. I've never seen anything
like this before.
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[The rain and thunder continue.]
INT--BEDROOM IN O'NEILL'S CABIN
[The power is out in the cabin. Seated on the bed, Mitchell sets the
portable phone back in its cradle. He hears a noise and gets up from
the bed to peer out the window into the storm. He hears another noise
inside the cabin and turns around.]
MITCHELL
Sir?
[He pulls a pistol from his duffel bag and goes to his closed door.]
MITCHELL
(whispering)
Sir!
[He opens the door and walks slowly into the living room. He moves into
another room, listens for a moment, then hears a sound behind him. He
turns quickly, raising his weapon, to find Landry pointing a shotgun at
him.]
LANDRY
(lowering his gun)
Son of a bitch! Mitchell! What are you doing?
MITCHELL
(lowering his pistol)
Whoo! I thought I heard a noise.
LANDRY
Me, too.
[Mitchell laughs in relief.]
MITCHELL
Well, that'd a been a helluva story, sir.
LANDRY
(laughing nervously)
Yeah!
MITCHELL
Shotgun, huh? Thought you didn't like to hunt.
LANDRY
I was up here last summer. Had a black bear come right through the
kitchen door.
MITCHELL
Phones are down.
LANDRY
It happens. The power could be out for a while, too.
[He leans over a table and picks up two flashlights, giving one to
Mitchell.]
LANDRY
That's quite a storm out there.
MITCHELL
(turning on flashlight)
Thank you. Well. 'Night, sir.
LANDRY
'Night, Mitchell.
[They each start back to their separate bedrooms.]
MITCHELL
General. Listen, uh, maybe I'm not the only one around here who
needs to relax.
LANDRY
I'll try not to shoot you before morning.
MITCHELL
Thank you, sir. Same here.
[They go to their bedrooms.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Someone watches the cabin from outside.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Mitchell exits the cabin, carrying his duffel bag, and finds Landry
outside, dressed in camouflage BDU's. Nearby is a sheriff's SUV, a
sheriff standing beside it facing away from them.]
MITCHELL
What's up, sir?
[Mitchell throws his duffel into the back seat of his Mustang.]
LANDRY
Going somewhere, Mitchell?
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. The phone's still down, the power's still out. I figured
we'd head back to reality today.
LANDRY
Unfortunately, the storm washed out the road into town.
[Mitchell looks up at Landry, surprised, then stands.]
MITCHELL
The road?
LANDRY
(smiling wryly)
It's the only road in and out of here. Looks like we're roughing it
until they get it cleared.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir, but you're a powerful Air Force General. You could order
us up a chopper.
LANDRY
We don't use helicopters for our own personal transportation,
Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Right, sir.
LANDRY
Besides, I already checked. There wasn't one available.
[He starts to walk back to the cabin.]
LANDRY
We'll be fine. Just another day or so.
[Defeated and shocked, Mitchell sits down on the edge of the car's
front seat.]
INT--SGC, LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Carter sits in a chair across the desk from Landry's usual chair. She
is on the phone.]
CARTER
Okay, thank you.
[She hangs up the phone and returns to reading from a folder in her
lap. Vala enters after a brief pause at the doorway.]
VALA
So, you'll be pleased to hear that all four members of SG-25 are
going to be fine. Thanks in part to my handiwork with a Goa'uld
healing device.
CARTER
I'm sure Doctor Lam appreciates the help.
[Vala moves to the other side of Landry's desk and perches above it.]
VALA
I see you haven't gotten over your phobia of General Landry's chair.
[As she speaks she wiggles her hips over the seat of the chair.]
CARTER
What are you doing?
VALA
I think it's about time a woman sat here.
[She settles into the seat and smiles proudly.]
CARTER
Actually, Doctor Elizabeth Weir sat there all the time when she ran
the SGC.
VALA
She did? Hmm. Good for her.
[Vala lifts her feet and is about to place them on the desk when Carter
gestures for her to stop.]
CARTER
Ah ha ha ha!
[Vala puts her feet back on the floor, irritated. Carter smiles and
starts to go back to her reading.]
VALA
So, now that the deadly creature of P3 whatever's been dealt with,
when do we go?
CARTER
I just got a call from the Silver Creek Sheriff's department.
Apparently there was a bad storm up there last night, and the road
leading up to the area where the cabin is washed out and won't be
reopened until tomorrow.
VALA
(very disappointed)
Ohhh... How unfortunate.
CARTER
(smiling)
I'm sure Colonel Mitchell agrees.
VALA
I'm sure the boys are having the time of their lives, getting up to
all sorts of mischief.
CARTER
(sarcastically)
Oh yeah, I can just imagine.
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[The sky is clear and smoke comes from the chimney.]
INT--O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Mitchell and Landry are in the kitchen. Mitchell is wearing the Air
Force sweatshirt and blue sweatpants, and Landry his camo BDU's.]
LANDRY
You're in for a treat, Colonel.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. I can, I can see that.
[Landry puts on a camo hat.]
LANDRY
The Fulvous Whistling-Duck. Very rare. Endangered, actually. Only
spotted one once in my life. And as good fortune would have it,
their mating season is right now, and they love to come out after a
good rain.
MITCHELL
That's a good one, sir.
[Mitchell puts his coffee cup into the sink.]
MITCHELL
You know what, the hat really sells it.
[Landry looks at him, surprised. He has one pair of binoculars around
his neck and another in his hands.]
MITCHELL
(realizing)
Ah, you're serious. Well, sir, as, uh, tempting as a duck that
whistles sounds, uh, I was thinking about going for a run. Work off
some of that beer from last night.
LANDRY
(holding up the binoculars)
You're missing the opportunity of a lifetime, Mitchell.
MITCHELL
(tightly)
Are you making it an order?
LANDRY
Birding is something you have to have in your soul, son. You have to
come to it on your own.
MITCHELL
(pitifully)
Well, I gotta be honest with you, sir. I don't know that I have it
in me.
LANDRY
The plaintive mating call of this duck is unlike anything you've
ever heard.
[Landry then proceeds to emulate the mating call, a trilling sound
followed by two long, descending sounds. He repeats the call and smiles
proudly. Mitchell looks as if he is fighting not to laugh out loud.]
MITCHELL
Permission to leave, sir.
LANDRY
(surprised)
Granted.
MITCHELL
Okay, here I go.
[Mitchell leaves. Landry turns and watches after him, sighs, smiles,
then chuckles.]
EXT--FRONT OF O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Someone watches Mitchell exit the cabin, again through blue tinted
vision. He jogs past whoever is watching without noticing anything
amiss.]
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM
[Some scientists are working on the corpse of the creature, cutting
into it while monitors display what they are seeing. The scientists
wear white coveralls and clear visors that cover their entire faces.
Teal'c watches from above in the observation area. Carter joins him.]
CARTER
How's it going?
TEAL'C
Doctor Redden has just begun her examination. She appears to be
quite knowledgeable.
CARTER
Well, she should be. She's been heading up the xenology unit at Area
51 for several years now.
[Redden pulls out a large piece of stringy tissue and examines it
curiously.]
CARTER
And, there goes my need for lunch.
REDDEN
(into recorder/com system)
Body cavity contains mammal-like organs. Unnatural looking tumors
appear prevalent.
(cutting into body)
Let's get this out.
[A monitor begins beeping.]
CARTER
(into microphone)
What's going on?
REDDEN
Scans are picking up low levels of radiation from within the body.
The location is somewhere in this stomach lining here.
[She continues exploring the body cavity.]
REDDEN
Huh. It looks like there's some kind of extraneous sack or abscess
attached to the stomach wall itself.
(to assistant)
Can I have a scalpel, please? Thank you.
(to all)
Attempting to remove it now.
[She cuts into the stomach.]
REDDEN
Whoa!
[Redden steps away from the table in shock. A black wormlike creature
leaves the corpse and begins moving around. Carter looks on, worried;
Teal'c is not there. The creature jumps toward Redden. It falls to a
zat blast in mid-air, fired by Teal'c, who has entered the room.]
REDDEN
(to Teal'c)
Thank you!
[Teal'c nods, and Redden huffs out a breath. From the observation room,
Carter swallows in worry.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Mitchell is jogging through the woods at a good pace.]
HUNTER 1
Help! Help!
[A man dressed in hunting attire and carrying a rifle comes out of the
woods and right at Mitchell. Mitchell stops.]
MITCHELL
(holding up his hands)
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa!
HUNTER 1
Get out of here!
MITCHELL
(grabbing the barrel of the rifle)
Watch where you're pointing that weapon.
[Mitchell takes the rifle from the man.]
MITCHELL
What's wrong?
HUNTER 1
(nearly hysterical)
Something attacked us, man. It came out of nowhere. It attacked my
buddy Mike.
MITCHELL
All right, all right. Take me to Mike.
[They move off together to a different area.]
HUNTER 1
This way.
[The hunter stops to look at something and Mitchell continues, holding
the hunter's rifle. He finds the body of the hunter, his arm ripped
from his body and lying beside it.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Redden is giving a briefing to Carter, Teal'c, and Vala. On the large
screen she refers to a photo of a small mammal.]
REDDEN
So it seems our large, dead friend up in the lab used to look like
this. Uh, native to P9J three thirty-three, a docile herbivore, very
shy and completely harmless according to the locals.
VALA
Well it seems one of them at least has had an identity crisis.
REDDEN
Yes, well, something caused rapid and extensive mutation.
CARTER
That something, I take it, was creature number two.
REDDEN
Exactly.
[She changes the screen to show the black worm against a ruler. It is
over seven inches long. Carter cringes.]
REDDEN
This little fella apparently gives off a type of radiation we've
never encountered before.
[She changes the screen to show schematics and data about the
creature.]
REDDEN
It lodged itself in the stomach lining of the host creature and
began altering the host's DNA.
CARTER
Yet the inhabitants of P9J-333 claim to have never seen or heard of
any such mutation to any of the animals on their planet.
REDDEN
Oh, well, I strongly doubt that our smaller friend there is
indigenous to the planet.
CARTER
So, the question is, how did it get there?
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Paramedics load the body of the hunter, in a body bag, into an
ambulance. Sheriffs stand by, and one walks alongside Landry. Various
vehicles are parked and others are driving through.]
LANDRY
It was an animal. Most likely a grizzly protecting its young.
STOKES
The witness is pretty freaked out.
LANDRY
His friend just got mauled to death! He said it was a bear.
STOKES
He said a bear or something.
LANDRY
I know it can get boring up here, Wade. It doesn't mean you have to
go making up things that are going to get the locals all excited.
[They arrive at his truck and are distracted by two groups of hunters
who drive by in vehicles, yelling and honking drunkenly and as if they
are on a mission.]
STOKES
Oh. Guess it's a little late for that.
LANDRY
Seal off the park before the place turns into a shooting gallery.
STOKES
Look, I only got three deputies working for me, plus half a dozen
volunteer rangers. This is hunting season. If I got a mad grizzly on
the loose, I need it dealt with. The best that I can hope for is
that somebody kills whatever did this before it kills again.
[Stokes climbs into his truck. Landry sighs, worried.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Klaxons are sounding. Carter walks quickly through the corridor.
Medics roll an empty gurney behind her. They arrive in the gate room.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[A member of SG-12 descends the ramp.]
CARTER
Lieutenant, you reported an emergency. What happened?
[Other personnel come down the ramp. Carter sees that one is injured.]
CARTER
What happened?
SG-12 MEMBER
Colonel, we've got a problem.
[The other members of SG-12 help the injured man onto a gurney. His
left leg is torn and bandaged.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter is studying a report and using a laptop that is open beside
her. Teal'c and Vala enter.]
TEAL'C
There have been no attacks of this nature reported by any Jaffa
settlements.
CARTER
None of our other off-world allies are reporting any such contacts,
either.
VALA
Except we now have an attack by yet another predatory creature, this
time on a completely different planet.
CARTER
Not to mention a world that's already been converted by the Ori.
TEAL'C
If the inhabitants of P2R-866 have already accepted Origin, there
would be no need for the Priors to inflict this creature upon them.
CARTER
Exactly. Which means that the Ori may have absolutely nothing to do
with these creatures.
VALA
So where are they coming from?
CARTER
I don't know. But so far, to the best of our knowledge, they're only
showing up on worlds we visit.
[The three exchange concerned looks.]
INT--O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Mitchell is putting on a leather jacket.]
MITCHELL
This sheriff doesn't think we have a bigfoot on our hands, does he?
LANDRY
He's a decent enough guy. Probably just watches too much television.
[He hands Mitchell a shotgun. Mitchell checks it, pulls the pump
action, and verifies the barrels are empty.]
MITCHELL
On the other hand, we have seen real live alien monsters.
[Landry hands him another shotgun and a box of shells.]
LANDRY
He doesn't know that.
MITCHELL
True. But uh, he could just be looking for his fifteen minutes.
[Mitchell begins loading one of the shotguns with shells.]
LANDRY
He's not that sort of man.
MITCHELL
Well it certainly would bring some publicity to the area. Bump up
tourism.
LANDRY
Whatever his motivation is, he sure got everyone's attention. We got
a bunch of drunken hunters out there all hyped up looking for
revenge and glory.
MITCHELL
(handing Landry a loaded shotgun)
So are we siding with the hunters, or the bear?
LANDRY
I don't want to see anyone else get hurt.
MITCHELL
(loading the other shotgun)
Just checking, sir.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Landry and Mitchell walk alone through the woods. There is the sound
of running water nearby.]
MITCHELL
This I like, sir.
LANDRY
A man is dead, Colonel.
MITCHELL
Yes sir, I know, and I do sympathize. It's just you keep telling me
to relax. It has nothing to do with being here with you, sir. Truth
is, I sit around with nothing to do, I get antsy. I'm much more at
ease off-world, in the thick of it.
LANDRY
I was flying air support out of Bien Hoa. Caught some triple-A in my
left engine and had to eject. Ended up landing somewhere near the
Laotian border, well north of the DMZ. Cut my knee up pretty good in
the process. I was lost, bleeding badly, no food, no radio. Half a
battalion of North Vietnamese regulars were combing the jungle
looking for me. Tracked me day and night. Followed my blood trail.
[They stop, and Mitchell checks a sign on the forest floor.]
MITCHELL
Obviously you got away, sir.
[Mitchell stands, and they continue.]
LANDRY
Took me eight days.
MITCHELL
So that's why you don't like to hunt.
LANDRY
I never felt more alive.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
But I wouldn't call it relaxing.
MITCHELL
Well, I'm kinda twisted that way, sir.
[Mitchell holds up his hand in a "stop" gesture. They are near a
stream. Mitchell raises his shotgun and pulls the pump-action to load
the chambers. In the trees in front of them, something seems to move,
but it isn't visible. Mitchell pauses a moment then runs toward the
movement and continues running through the woods. His and Landry's
radios come alive.]
VOICE
(over radio)
Sheriff Stokes, come in. We're about a mile northwest of Silver
Creek Junction. We've found another body. It's been torn to shreds.
[Landry pulls his radio out of his pocket.]
LANDRY
Colonel, respond!
[Some distance away now, Mitchell stops and pulls out his radio.]
MITCHELL
I hear it, sir.
[He puts the radio back in his pocket and continues. Landry moves off
and soon comes upon three hunters and Mitchell looking grim.]
LANDRY
Colonel.
MITCHELL
Victim number two.
[There is a bloodied body in the creek.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter, Vala, and Teal'c are talking.]
CARTER
The first mission to P9J-333 was simply to observe and initiate
first contact with the locals, should they reject the Ori. The
second mission, to P2R-866 was purely covert surveillance of an
already converted planet.
VALA
Two completely different missions, both to worlds not inhabited by
scary creatures of any kind.
CARTER
Right. However, there was one single common element to both
missions. Both required teams to remain inconspicuous. Stealth was
key.
TEAL'C
Then both teams would have been required to use the Sodan cloaking
device in order to remain hidden.
CARTER
Exactly. We tested them for safety and started deploying them on
missions such as these just over a week ago.
VALA
You think there's some sort of malfunction with the devices?
CARTER
Yes, but we have another problem. I requested a complete recall of
all the Sodan cloaking devices including the ones still at Area 51.
It turns out, one of them is missing.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC ISOLATION ROOM
[Carter is in the observation area, watching data on a computer
monitor. Three sensors are set in a triangle in the isolation room, red
lights blinking.]
CARTER
No abnormal energy readings. No power spikes. All systems appear to
be normal. Looks like that one checks out too.
[In the isolation room, Teal'c appears, having turned off the cloaking
device he was wearing. Vala enters the observation area and sits next
to Carter.]
VALA
How's it going?
CARTER
Nothing yet.
VALA
Any word from Area 51?
CARTER
Yeah. Agent Barrett called in about an hour ago. Said his team has
detained everyone who had security clearance to the lab where the
devices were being held.
[As she speaks, Teal'c places the device in a padded case and makes an
entry on the computer next to it.]
CARTER
We should have more answers after he's finished questioning them.
VALA
So he's made a full recovery, then?
CARTER
He's cleared for duty, but he still feels responsible for what
happened.
[Teal'c straps another device onto his left wrist, as he listens to the
conversation.]
VALA
Well, he was brainwashed. It's hardly his fault.
CARTER
Still, he's determined to find out how it happened and catch those
responsible.
TEAL'C
It is ironic that not so long ago the mere presence of the Goa'uld
on Earth would have been cause for great concern.
CARTER
Seriously! Who'd ever think that we'd have bigger fish to fry.
(teasing)
Or that you'd use the word ironic in a sentence.
TEAL'C
(smiling)
Indeed.
[Carter smiles. Teal'c hits a key on the computer and steps to the
middle of the isolation room.]
TEAL'C
I am ready.
CARTER
Okay, go for it.
[He activates the device and disappears. Carter looks at her monitor's
readouts.]
CARTER
Nothing.
[A large white blob appears on the screen.]
CARTER
Wait a second. There's elevated radiation coming from within the
area of the cloaking field... Levels are climbing.
[Still invisible, Teal'c sees one of the black creatures on the floor.
He aims his weapon at it and uncloaks, and the creature becomes visible
to all of them. Carter and Vala look on in amazement.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[There are many spent shotgun shells on the ground. Mitchell and Landry
approach and see them.]
MITCHELL
Lot of activity out here, sir.
LANDRY
I told ya, the last thing we need is for this place to turn into the
OK Corral.
[They hear shooting nearby.]
MITCHELL
Or a Vice Presidential bird hunt.
[They move toward the sound and come upon four hunters firing next to
each other at an unseen target.]
MITCHELL
Hold fire! Cease fire!
LANDRY
You boys want to tell me what you're shooting at?
HUNTER 2
(gesturing with his shotgun)
We saw something moving in there.
[Mitchell moves off in the direction the hunter indicated.]
HUNTER 2
Hey man, you crazy? Where the hell's he going?
[Mitchell finds a broken branch with blood on it, then more blood on a
tree. He follows the blood trail. At the base of a tree he sees blood
dripping from nowhere and spreading on the ground. He points his weapon
at the base of the tree.]
MITCHELL
Turn that thing off.
[A man de-cloaks. He is injured and sitting against the tree.]
TRUST OPERATIVE
(plaintive)
Help me.
[Mitchell lowers his gun.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c sits on the edge of a bed. Carter and Vala face him.]
CARTER
So, you're sure you're okay.
TEAL'C
I am fine, Colonel Carter.
VALA
No headaches, no nausea. Nothing that might indicate early symptoms
of sudden-onset monsterism?
TEAL'C
I am fine.
REDDEN
(entering, reading a printout)
Actually, you are. There's no signs of radiation poisoning. No
evidence of genetic manipulation. I'm guessing this creature,
whatever it is, requires sustained close contract in order to affect
its victim's DNA.
VALA
Well, that's reassuring for all of us.
REDDEN
Well, we're running some tests on it right now, but I would like to
know more about what actually happened. You said it just appeared
inside the cloaking field?
[Teal'c starts to answer but Vala interrupts.]
VALA
And then it just sat there like a lump.
TEAL'C
The one inside the stomach of the mutated creature was quite active.
REDDEN
Yeah, I noticed. It practically attacked me. And this one has
actually been more active recently in its containment tank.
CARTER
I suppose it's possible it was temporarily stunned by its transition
to our dimension.
REDDEN
(confused)
I'm sorry?
CARTER
Well, that would explain why the people using the cloaks haven't
been attacked by the creatures.
REDDEN
No, no. I mean the "transition to our dimension" part.
CARTER
Ah. The Sodan cloaking device emits an energy field around the
wearer that puts them slightly out of phase with our normal
dimension of space-time. Essentially whoever is in the field is
accessing a pocket of sub-space, making them virtually undetectable.
[Redden tries to take it all in.]
VALA
So, you think this creature is from an alternate dimension and is
essentially bleeding through?
CARTER
Yeah, it's definitely possible.
TEAL'C
Ancient technology has allowed us to see extra-dimensional
life-forms before.
VALA
The Sodan were using these devices for hundreds of years. You'd
think there'd at least be a label on the side in bold print that
says "beware, may cause deadly extra-dimensional radioactive
monster-causing creature to appear." Or at least "danger" would have
been nice.
TEAL'C
Perhaps the Sodan were not aware of such a flaw in the technology.
CARTER
It's possible this wasn't even a problem until we started using the
devices.
(suddenly realizing)
I think I know why this is happening.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Mitchell removes the cloaking device from the operative's wrist and
checks his wound.]
MITCHELL
I think it went straight through. Congratulations. You're going to
be fine.
[Mitchell squats down nearby and examines the device.]
TRUST OPERATIVE
What? I've been shot!
MITCHELL
Yeah you have. Hurts, don't it. Don't worry, I've had worse.
TRUST OPERATIVE
(near panic)
I'm bleeding to death here! I need an ambulance.
MITCHELL
Ah, I can do that. Soon as I find out what you're doing running
around the woods with a Sodan cloaking device.
TRUST OPERATIVE
You're gonna let me die?!
MITCHELL
I figure you're connected to The Trust. Am I right? Orders to spy on
General Landry, myself and SG-1?
TRUST OPERATIVE
Please, just get me to a hospital.
MITCHELL
See, obviously you're not a Goa'uld otherwise you'd just heal
yourself.
TRUST OPERATIVE
What are you talking about?
MITCHELL
Snakes. Snakes in people's heads. Evil snakes, controlling their
hosts' bodies with megalomaniac take-over-the-galaxy delusions.
TRUST OPERATIVE
I know what a Goa'uld is.
MITCHELL
You know you're working for one? That's who's running The Trust
these days.
[The operative looks disbelieving.]
TRUST OPERATIVE
You're crazy, man.
MITCHELL
Yeah, that's what they keep telling me. You know they really should
give you a personal shield to go with that cloaking device. That and
half a brain.
[Mitchell has taken out his radio and is preparing to use it.]
INT--O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Landry has made himself a cup of coffee. He is on the phone.]
LANDRY
(into phone)
We found a car filled with surveillance and recording equipment
about a half a mile from here. I figure the most he learned is that
Mitchell is terrible at chess and has some form of sleep apnea. What
else have you learned?
INT--SGC, LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Carter stands beside Landry's chair.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Well, sir, the reason the creatures are entering our dimension is
our fault.
The scene flips back and forth between the cabin and Landry's office as
Landry and Carter speak to each other over the phone.
LANDRY
How's that?
CARTER
(into phone)
When we first started using the Sodan devices, we noticed that they
emitted a significant amount of radiation.
LANDRY
This is different from the radiation given off by the
interdimensional creatures?
CARTER
Yes, sir, but not unrelated. We made modifications to shield the
radioactive emissions in order to make the devices safer for human
use.
LANDRY
I'm guessing there was a practical reason for the radioactive
output.
CARTER
Doctor Redden tested the creatures for a reaction to the radiation
given off by the unshielded cloaking devices. They're repelled by
it.
LANDRY
And the Sodan would have been protected from the radioactivity
because of their symbiotes.
CARTER
Exactly. Which is why they never had this problem. We thought the
radiation was a coincidental by-product of the technology.
LANDRY
When it was actually performing a vital function. Do we have any
idea how frequent this dimensional breach might be?
CARTER
No, sir. It appears to be a random occurrence. But given how long
The Trust Operative was using the Sodan device to stay hidden, I'd
say that whatever's on the loose around the cabin is probably a lot
worse than a grizzly.
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Men dressed in military BDU's assist the operative into a military
ambulance. There are special forces troops standing around as well.]
STOKES
Two hunters dead and now a guy with no I.D. You wanna bring me into
the loop here, Colonel?
MITCHELL
A guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time, got shot for his
troubles. Bound to happen with all these yahoos running around the
woods with guns.
STOKES
Then why am I not being allowed to question him?
[Landry walks up, holding a shotgun.]
LANDRY
Because the Air Force is taking over this investigation in the
interest of national security.
STOKES
(turning back toward his truck, then stopping)
So, just grizzly bear, huh? Since when does the Air Force go after a
bear in the name of national security?
LANDRY
There's nothing for you to be concerned about, Wade. Things'll be
back to normal around here in no time.
[Disappointed, Stokes shakes his head and walks to the far, driver's
side of his truck. Landry and Mitchell turn away from him and step
toward the cabin. Suddenly a large creature comes out of the woods,
growling, and attacks the Sheriff. Mitchell and Landry turn back,
raising their shotguns. The creature growls, and the sheriff screams.
Mitchell and Landry arrive just as the creature is dragging the sheriff
away. There is a large, bloody dent in the driver's side door of the
truck.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Mitchell and Landry are in pursuit. They stop when they find Stokes'
bloody hat on the ground.]
LANDRY
Damn it.
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[Military personnel and vehicles are around the front of the cabin. A
helicopter is heard overhead. A large tents is set up as operations
center and boxes of materiel are stacked outside it. Mitchell is inside
the tent with Carter, Teal'c, Vala, and Landry, standing in front of a
map of the area. They are all dressed in green BDU's with tac vests and
SGC machine guns.]
MITCHELL
So we're talkin' about a little critter from a different dimension
that burrows into a big critter, turning it into a rampaging
monster.
CARTER
In a nutshell.
MITCHELL
Nice. How do we find it?
CARTER
Well, I've calibrated a number of hand-held scanners to pick up the
creature's radioactive energy signature. We should be able to track
it within a three-hundred meter range. We've also devised a
radioactive isotope package that gives off an energy wave similar to
the ones emitted by the Sodan cloaking devices.
(referring to the map)
We're air-dropping them in a perimeter around the park. It should
stop the creature from getting too far.
REYNOLDS
Isn't that dangerous for us?
CARTER
Only if you come within a hundred meters of the package. They have a
decay rate that will leave them inert in less than six hours.
VALA
It'll be dark soon.
CARTER
We can't let this thing get away.
VALA
(stepping to the front of the crowd)
Right. So obviously rule number one when hunting savage beasts like
this is to never actually crawl through the forest looking for them,
especially at night. Always find a way to lure them to you.
[As she speaks, Carter, Mitchell, and Landry all appear to be amazed
and somewhat annoyed at Vala's presumption.]
VALA
So I suggest the best plan of attack would be to plant these isotope
packages (pointing to map)
here and here.
[Mitchell catches Vala's eye and tilts his head toward Landry.]
VALA
(to Landry)
Or whatever you want.
[Landry steps up to the map and Vala withdraws.]
LANDRY
You'll operate in teams of four. Each team will conduct grid sweeps
starting here, no more than three hundred meters apart. Radio
contact every ten minutes.
VALA
That's brilliant. Oh--
LANDRY
You have your orders. Move out!
[Everyone leaves except Mitchell and Vala.]
VALA
(disappointed)
But they didn't hear the rest of my plan.
MITCHELL
We'll call it Plan B.
[Mitchell leaves, and Vala follows, somewhat annoyed.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Mitchell and Landry search with one other SF. They use the flashlights
on their weapons for illumination.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Nearby, Vala walks with Teal'c, followed by Reynolds and one other.
They look at the hand-held scanner.]
VALA
This won't work, you know... All I'm saying is why not take
advantage of my vast experience instead of leaving it up to--
(turning to men behind her)
no offense, (turning back to Teal'c)
amateurs.
TEAL'C
A mighty Jaffa warrior once said the greatest strategy is doomed to
fail if there is no army to follow it. It is one, we are many. That
is why we will prevail.
[Teal'c continues but a frustrated Vala stops to check her scanner.
Reynolds catches up to her.]
REYNOLDS
Excuse me. Amateurs coming through.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Mitchell signals for the men with him to stop.]
MITCHELL
I'm picking up something. Two hundred meters north-northwest.
(into radio)
Sam, what's your twenty?
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Carter is searching with a different team.]
CARTER
(into radio)
I'm directly west of you.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
MITCHELL
(into radio)
We've got a bogey just north-east of your position. Can you zero in
on it?
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
CARTER
(checking scanner)
Got it. Moving on target.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
[Teal'c looks at Vala's scanner output.]
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Colonel Mitchell, we have detected the creature.
MITCHELL
(over radio)
Teal'c, where are you?
TEAL'C
Just south of your position.
EXT--WOODS NEAR O'NEILL'S CABIN, NIGHT
MITCHELL
(to Landry)
We're all picking up the same target, sir.
[All the teams converge on the same clearing, weapons ready. There is
nothing visible.]
REYNOLDS
Marines, secure perimeter!
[The Marines move off.]
MITCHELL
(to Carter)
All right, where the hell is it?
CARTER
We should be right on top of it!
VALA
Look, no creature, no matter how vicious, is stupid enough to attack
a group of this size, so trust me, we've probably scared it off.
[The creature appears next to a tree not far behind Vala.]
MITCHELL
Vala!
VALA
What?
MITCHELL
Down!
[She hesitates just a moment, hears the creature growling, then drops
to the ground. Landry, Mitchell, Teal'c and Carter begin firing at the
creature. They hit it, but it hops away. They begin to reload their
weapons and Vala stands up.]
VALA
Of course I have been known to be wrong on occasion.
CARTER
Holy Hannah, did you see that thing?
REYNOLDS
You think we scared it off now?
MITCHELL
No, I think we pissed it off.
CARTER
(looking at scanner)
It's circling us.
LANDRY
Backs together!
[They all rush to the center of the clearing and face outward from
there.]
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
We have a contact in the area.
[They hear the creature growling. Mitchell moves his flashlight around
and sees a distortion. He lowers the gun for a moment. The creature
comes running out of the woods, and Mitchell begins firing. The others
turn and join the firing. The creature is hit many times and shudders.
It growls in pain and falls over dead.]
MITCHELL
(moving toward body of creature)
Yeah, that's what I call relaxing!
[As he approaches, Vala fires a long burst of her P-90 into the
creature, which shakes with the impacts. Mitchell has to step away.]
MITCHELL
What the hell are you doing!?
VALA
Rule number two: never approach a creature assuming that it's dead.
MITCHELL
Allow me to explain to you a few of my rules.
LANDRY
(into radio)
All units, this is General Landry. The target has been neutralized.
I repeat, the target has been neutralized.
VALA
You know what's strange? I have never known a lone creature to
behave so aggressively toward a large group. Mind you, I've never
encountered a radioactive mutant before.
[They consider Vala's words. Mitchell sees something behind Landry.]
MITCHELL
Sir, get down!
[There is another creature behind Landry.]
LANDRY
Very funny, Mitchell. This is not--
MITCHELL
No, sir, get down!
[As he yells he runs forward and throws Landry to the ground. The
others all fire on the creature. It growls, shudders, and dies as well.
They look on in shock. Landry and Mitchell get up.]
VALA
Well, that explains that! Odd behavior for one creature, but not for
two.
MITCHELL
Feel better?
VALA
Uh huh!
EXT--O'NEILL'S CABIN, DAY
[The last humvee drives off. The military presence is gone. Mitchell
and Landry's cars remain.]
INT--O'NEILL'S CABIN
[Teal'c, Vala, Mitchell, and Carter are playing poker with chips.]
VALA
Shall we see who's flopped their nuts.
[She turns over a card.]
VALA
A queen.
[Landry enters and stands beside the table.]
VALA
Ah, General, good timing. Colonel Mitchell's about to run out of
chips. We need new blood.
MITCHELL
Any word, sir?
LANDRY
Final ground sweeps have come up empty. And although it is a big
park, our scanners have a limited range, so we're dropping a fresh
radioactive perimeter, sealing off the area for another week as a
precaution.
CARTER
I think it's unlikely that there's a third creature, sir.
VALA
Care to place odds on that?
CARTER
Ha. I'm not much of a gambler.
TEAL'C
(challenging)
That is obvious.
[Carter gives him a surprised look.]
VALA
Oooh. Okay.
[She deals a card to Carter.]
VALA
River comes up.
[She deals a card to herself.]
VALA
(pleased, swaying back and forth)
King of spades. Possible royal marriage or King Kong in the works.
MITCHELL
Way too much poker-telling going on here.
[Teal'c groans in agreement and places a small stack of chips into the
kitty, then smiles.]
MITCHELL
(crossing his arms)
I'm out.
CARTER
(pushing all her chips into the kitty)
I'm all in.
[Carter looks expectantly at Vala.]
VALA
I'm out.
[Carter looks challengingly at Teal'c. He smiles, then they stare each
other down for a moment.]
TEAL'C
A true warrior... knows when to fold them.
MITCHELL
(putting his hand over his eyes)
Oh.
CARTER
(smiling hugely)
Really? I won? Ha ha ha, I was totally bluffing!
LANDRY
Well played, Colonel!
CARTER
(smiling, pulling the chips to her)
Thank you, sir.
MITCHELL
(to Teal'c)
A true warrior knows when to hold 'em. She took you downtown,
homeboy.
LANDRY
I'm glad to see you all having a good time.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. Last night was the most fun I've had since... well I don't
know when. The look on your face when I said, "Sir, get down!"
[Landry looks almost insulted, Carter shocked at the gaffe.]
MITCHELL
What!? A hundred times the man has told me to relax.
LANDRY
(wryly)
Not that much.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir. Well, it's good to see you relaxing too, sir.
LANDRY
Right. Now...
[He pulls a chair up and sits down.]
LANDRY
Deal me in.
[Vala laughs and prepares to deal another hand.]
