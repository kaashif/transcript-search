EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DUSK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 is seated around the briefing table, along with Makepeace and the
rest of SG-3. Hammond is pacing the room.]
HAMMOND
When we completed interviews of all the refugees you brought back
from Chu'lak, ten of them identified the final four symbols the
Goa'ulds used to escape through the Chu'lak Stargate. When we
disregard the last one as point of origin that leaves three to work
with.
[He cues a computer screen to display the glyphs.]
HAMMOND
Captain Carter's computer model has thus far extrapolated only one
set of symbols from the Abydos cartouche that contains these three
glyphs.
O'NEILL
Let me guess. That's where we're going.
HAMMOND
Very good, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Thank you, sir. I pride myself on my deductive reasoning skills.
HAMMOND
In one hour, you will go through the Gate to the planet represented
by these symbols. It has been designated P3X-797.
DANIEL
Couldn't we call this planet something that's a little easier to
remember?
CARTER
Ah, it's based on a binary code the computer uses for extrapolation.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Which makes it much easier to remember.
HAMMOND
We sent a MALP probe through thirty minutes ago. Atmosphere is
breathable, no detectable radiation and temperature approximately
forty degrees Fahrenheit.
O'NEILL
Can we see the video playback sir?
[Hammond pauses.]
HAMMOND
There is no playback.
O'NEILL
Why no playback?
HAMMOND
It appears to be very dark where the Gate resides on this planet.
CARTER
Well, the MALP probe has lights on it, doesn't it?
HAMMOND
We think they were broken during transport through the Gate.
DANIEL
This is crazy. We don't know what could be there waiting for us when
we come through.
MAKEPEACE
Don't you worry boys. That's why the SG-3 Marines are coming with.
You can count on us to watch your backsides.
DANIEL
Actually, it's more my front side I was worried about.
[Makepeace raises his eyebrows at Daniel.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Close up shot of stargate spinning. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c make
their way to the Gate.]
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron four, encoded. Chevron five, encoded.
[Daniel rushes in.]
O'NEILL
You're late; put these on.
[He hands Daniel night vision goggles.]
DANIEL
(looks at goggles)
Doesn't look like my prescription.
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron six, encoded.
CARTER
Thermal night vision goggles.
O'NEILL
Hey, here's a question. Why doesn't the MALP have a set of these?
[Carter grins.]
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron seven, locked.
[Gate whooshes into life.]
HAMMOND'S VOICE
SG-1 and SG-3 you have a go. Repeat, you have a go.
[Makepeace pushes his way through SG-1.]
MAKEPEACE
Okay, we'll take point.
O'NEILL
Ah. We'll go through first. You watch our lovely backsides,
remember?
[O'Neill heads up the ramp.]
MAKEPEACE
Have it your way, flyboy.
DANIEL
Are you out of your mind?
O'NEILL
If Skaara or Sha're are on the other side, those jarheads'll open
fire as soon as they see the light of their eyes, if you know what I
mean. You want that?
[Daniel gestures for O'Neill to go forward.]
O'NEILL
Give us ten count then "come on down."
[SG-1 steps through the wormhole. SG-3 step up to the Gate.]
MAKEPEACE
One-one thousand. Two-one thousand.
EXT--P3X-797, DARKNESS
[SG-1 step from the Gate.]
O'NEILL
(whispers)
Fan out.
[SG-1 puts on the night vision goggles and sees people running though
the underbrush. They are attacked with sticks. Teal'c's staff weapon
fires. SG-3 comes through the wormhole and opens fire over their heads
as one of SG-1 is about to be crushed by a large rock.]
MAKEPEACE
Fire!
[Attackers run off.]
MAKEPEACE
I'm real glad it was you who took point.
O'NEILL
I'm okay. Thanks for asking. Everybody else?
CARTER
I think so.
DANIEL
What were those things?
O'NEILL
I haven't the slightest idea.
[They brush the hair away from one of the dead attacker's faces. He
looks mostly human, but with some prehistoric human qualities.]

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--P3X-797
[O'Neill gestures Makepeace forward.]
MAKEPEACE
Judson.
[SG-3 follow Makepeace through the forest. SG-1 spy on a group of their
attackers.]
O'NEILL
Daniel, what are they?
DANIEL
Well, they don't look completely Homo sapien. Ah, the larger brow
ridge would imply Homo erectus but then again they'd have canine
teeth. Ah, could be Australopithecus but the brow ridge would be
less prominent.
O'NEILL
You don't know, do you?
DANIEL
No.
CARTER
Why does that one female look different? She looks more human.
[They see as the girl gets grabbed.]
CARTER
We have to stop them.
DANIEL
No, that's how prehistoric males probably always had sex. Forcibly.
The strongest male gets to mate, that's survival of the fittest.
CARTER
Well, I call it rape and I think we should stop it.
[She starts to get up.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
[O'Neill gestures for her to get back down. Rocks start flying.]
DANIEL
Where are those rocks coming from?
O'NEILL
There.
[He gestures toward a group of figures dressed in white who are
throwing rocks at the primitives.]
O'NEILL
Makepeace, you and your men take a wide left flank. We'll take the
right. Go.
(to SG-1)
Let's go.
SG-3 MEMBER
(to people in white)
Don't move!
O'NEILL
All right, hold your fire!
DANIEL
Get away. Lower your weapons!
SG-3 MEMBER
They could be Goa'ulds.
O'NEILL
Just keep 'em covered.
[He checks the neck of one of the people in white.]
O'NEILL
There's no entry scar. They're not Goa'ulds. Lower your weapons
kids.
(to Daniel)
Any idea what they are?
TUPLO
My Lord, we are the untouched, I am High Councilor Tuplo.
LEEDORA
We are pleased the gods have deemed us worthy of a return visit.
O'NEILL
Gods.
DANIEL
Ah, only the gods come through the Stargate I think they're talking
about us. We should probably start getting used to this kind of
treatment.
O'NEILL
Oh for crying out loud, we're not gods. Get up.
DANIEL
Please.
O'NEILL
C'mon.
[SG-1 helps Tuplo and his people to their feet.]
LEEDORA
(to Tuplo)
Perhaps they wish us to treat them as mortals. A test?
TUPLO
Please. Let us take you to the Land of Light.
INT--MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE--LAND OF LIGHT
O'NEILL
Love what they've done with the place.
CARTER
I was going to do my living room like this, but it didn't go with my
other stuff.
DANIEL
Looks Minoan.
TUPLO
Welcome. Please, come. Sit.
[SG-1 sit with Tuplo and his people at a table while Makepeace and SG-3
stand guard.]
CARTER
Is she all right?
[She nods at where the young woman is lying down)]
TUPLO
I do hope. She is my daughter.
CARTER
What's her name?
TUPLO
She is called Melosha. I can only hope we rescued her in time from
the hands of the Touched. We must now wait to see if she has been
cursed by them.
O'NEILL
The creatures that took her, what were they exactly?
TUPLO
They are the Touched. They were unfortunate enough to be cursed by
the Heelk'sha.
DANIEL
Hilk'sha. There's a word like that on Abydos. Is that Gods of the
Earth?
TEAL'C
Gods of the Underworld. Evil Gods.
LEEDORA
The Heelk'sha needed only to touch the unfortunate among us and they
would become possessed. Pure evil, like wild animals.
O'NEILL
So these..."Touched" people used to live here, with you?
TUPLO
They were us, until they changed. They became too dangerous and we
were forced to banish them to the Land of the Dark.
O'NEILL
And where are these evil gods now?
LEEDORA
Oh, they do not show themselves. We know only of their presence
because of their actions.
O'NEILL
When was the last time the good gods came around?
LEEDORA
Well, if you are not them, then it has been at least a generation.
O'NEILL
A generation. Okay.
(looks at the rest of SG-1)
Um, will you excuse us for a moment?
(to the Untouched as they rise)
Ah, no. Please no. Wait.
[He leads SG-1 over to the stairs for a conference.]
O'NEILL
Sounds like the Goa'ulds aren't here and haven't been for some time.
TEAL'C
That is my assessment as well.
O'NEILL
Daniel, Carter?
DANIEL
I agree.
CARTER
Yeah.
O'NEILL
In that case, gear up. We'll move out in fifteen minutes.
DANIEL
Wait a minute. Move out?
[Daniel and Carter glance at each other.]
O'NEILL
Yeah. Back to the Stargate. Back to Earth. Terra firma. Home. You've
heard of it?
DANIEL
W'uh, well we should stay awhile longer and study the society. Learn
how they've evolved from Minoan culture. I mean, see those statues
over there, those are bulls. The bull is all throughout Minoan
culture on Earth but we never really knew why.
O'NEILL
Hey I'm a big fan of all this stuff, but art appreciation is not
what this mission is about. Get your gear together.
[Walks off with Teal'c leaving Daniel and Carter to look at each
other.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
INT--GATE ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[SG-1 and SG-3 come through the Gate. Hammond walks in and greets
them.]
HAMMOND
Find anything?
O'NEILL
Uh, no sir.
DANIEL
Yes sir. Uh, actually sir, we found a whole hell of a lot, sir.
O'NEILL
Some beautiful décor, nice folks, nothing of strategic importance,
sir.
HAMMOND
All right, get cleaned up. Mission debrief in half an hour.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
[They walk out leaving Daniel with a frustrated look on his face.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[SG-1 and SG-3 are seated around the briefing table along with
Hammond.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry sir, I know I'm a guest at this party, but I have to
protest.
HAMMOND
Let me guess, Doctor. This is the science versus military discussion
again?
DANIEL
Well...yes. This mission was a perfect example of my argument. We
should have stayed on that planet longer. It was the perfect
opportunity to study Minoan culture.
CARTER
Not to mention primitive man.
HAMMOND
This really isn't necessary, Doctors, I've already--
[Daniel breaks in.]
DANIEL
Sir, would you let me finish, please?
(Hammond nods.)
Okay, um, the people on the dark side are pre-Stone Age, but the
people on the light side are clearly from the Bronze Age, so what
better opportunity to study the Broca Divide?
O'NEILL
(yawns)
The what? Excuse me.
CARTER
Broca Divide. Pierre Paul Broca was a nineteenth century
anthropologist, he founded...
[Johnson glares at Teal'c.]
CARTER
...modern craniometry, to study craniums and brains and to compare
the divide in intelligence between early species of mankind.
O'NEILL
Fascinating.
(turns to Hammond)
Should I start the debriefing sir?
HAMMOND
Well, that would be a good idea, Colonel.
DANIEL
(breaking in)
Now just, just wait a minute.
HAMMOND
(breaking in)
Dr. Jackson you're wasting your breath, you've already won the
argument.
DANIEL
But I have to insist that you, w--, wha--, wha--, what? I've already
won?
HAMMOND
The president agrees with you. He's asked that we evaluate the
scientific and cultural value of each mission from now on.
O'NEILL
(rolls eyes)
Oh, for crying out loud.
[He rubs his eyes.]
DANIEL
He has...
[Hammond nods.]
CARTER
That's great.
[Johnson jumps up and attacks Teal'c.]
JOHNSON
Wonder how that thing in your gut would like its neck ripped in
half.
TEAL'C
Please release me, Lieutenant Johnson.
MAKEPEACE
(jumps up)
Johnson! Let him go.
JOHNSON
Not until the Goa'uld apologizes.
HAMMOND
(stands up)
Lieutenant Johnson take your seat now.
[Johnson screams and takes a swing at Teal'c. Teal'c blocks the punch
easily and subdues Johnson.]
TEAL'C
General, I would prefer to not hurt this man.
[Hammond nods and security runs in and takes charge of Johnson.]
HAMMOND
What is your problem, marine?
[Johnson foams at the mouth.]
HAMMOND
Take him to the infirmary, tell them to keep him in restraints and
check him out.
[They take Johnson away.]
INT--GATE ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
DANIEL
(holding a clipboard)
What do you think that was all about with Johnson?
CARTER
(holding a piece of equipment to the 'Gate)
Beats me. Maybe he was drunk.
DANIEL
I don't know. Didn't quite seem like inebriation.
[Two men fight in the background.]
CARTER
What the...?
[The men fall through the glass of the Briefing room and fall at least
twenty feet to the Gate room floor. Carter and Daniel rush over to
help.]
VOICE IN BACKGROUND
I don't know, I didn't see anything.
[Carter rushes over to a phone.]
CARTER
We need medics, section C stat, two men down.
[She slams the phone down and looks back at the men, scratching her
neck.]
INT--LOCKER ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[O'Neill is getting dressed after a shower. The locker door slams and
Carter is standing next to him.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
(hurries to put on shirt)
Sorry, didn't know you were in here.
[Carter grabs O'Neill and kisses him. O'Neill pushes her away.]
O'NEILL
Mmmph! Carter! Wait! What the hell is going on?
CARTER
I want you.
[She grabs O'Neill and kisses him again.]
O'NEILL
(muffled voice)
Why? I mean no!
[He manages to push her away.]
O'NEILL
Carter, this is a little out of line, don't you think?
[Carter slams O'Neill onto a bench.]
CARTER
Want me?
[She kisses O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
(muffled voice)
No. No, not like this, for crying out loud.
[He pushes Carter away again.]
O'NEILL
Carter! What's gotten into you?
[Carter tries to kiss him again. O'Neill rolls them over and slams them
onto the ground.]
O'NEILL
It's about time you saw a doctor, Doctor.
[He pulls her up.]
INT--INFIRMARY--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Carter is in restraints.]
FRAISER
Keep her from hurting herself until the sedatives take effect.
O'NEILL
This pretty much what Johnson has?
FRAISER
Oh, I'd say so, and the other members of the team. This is the
strangest thing I've ever seen. C'mon, take a look.
[She leads O'Neill away.]
INT--CORRIDOR--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
FRAISER
We've converted DEFCON 1 living compartments from when this place
was a missile silo into isolations chambers. You never know what
you're going to bring back through the Stargate.
[Fraiser pushes open an observations panel in a cell door and they look
in on Johnson.]
FRAISER
Notice the swelling of the brow ridge? Some are even developing new
follicle growth.
O'NEILL
Any idea what's causing it?
FRAISER
Wish I knew. I've got calls in to every specialist in the service,
but I've got one hand tied behind my back because of the need to
know classification of the Stargate Project.
[She closes the observation panel and walks to another door.]
FRAISER
And it's spreading. We got two more in an hour later.
[O'Neill opens observation panel and they look in on Makepeace beating
his hands bloody against a wall.]
FRAISER
I've never seen a behavioral disorder like this. All the victims are
acting like animals.
O'NEILL
You think Carter has the same thing?
FRAISER
Mm hmm, behavior fits. All the victims are behaving like primitives.
Most female, low level primates tend to choose their sexual partners
according to who would give them the strongest offspring. The
leaders of a pack or tribe are usually the prime choice, you should
be flattered.
O'NEILL
Oh yeah...I'm honored.
[O'Neill scratches the back of his neck.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
DANIEL
Jack! There you are. Got on the internet to do a little research on
Australopithecus and, wow...What happened to you?
O'NEILL
Oh, I got into a little wrestling match with Carter.
DANIEL
Why?
O'NEILL
I guess she's got whatever Johnson got. I had to drag her off to the
infirmary.
DANIEL
What, she start a fight with you like Johnson did with Teal'c?
O'NEILL
No, she uh, she tried to seduce me.
DANIEL
Oh. You poor man.
O'NEILL
No, it wasn't like that. She was like a wild animal, she was nuts.
DANIEL
Well, is she all right? I should go see her.
O'NEILL
Why?
DANIEL
What do you mean "why"? Because I care about her.
[O'Neill grabs Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Care about her, what does that mean?
DANIEL
It means I care about her, she's my friend. Now let go!
[Daniel tries to pull away.]
O'NEILL
She's not yours to care about.
DANIEL
What the hell are you talking about?
O'NEILL
I'm talking about Samantha, you just stay away from her, okay?
DANIEL
Okay. Okay Jack. I think you should come with me to the infirmary,
okay? Just let go of me and...let go of my arm!
[O'Neill punches Daniel who falls back into a shelf and goes crashing
to the ground.]
TECHNICIAN
Security, get in here!
[O'Neill jumps on Daniel and starts beating him up. Security and the
technician drag O'Neill off Daniel and haul him away.]
FEMALE OFFICER
(helps Daniel up)
You okay?
[Daniel gazes after O'Neill, blood on his face.]
INT--INFIRMARY--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Blood is being taken from Daniel and Teal'c.]
FRAISER
We've managed to isolate an organism in the victims' bloodsteams.
HAMMOND
Organism? Like a parasite or something?
FRAISER
More like a, a parasitical virus and from what I can tell it seems
to feed on alines and colines; chemical transmitters in the body.
That includes neurotransmitters. As they're depleted, all but the
most primitive parts of the brain seem to just shut down.
HAMMOND
That why they act like animals?
FRAISER
Actually, the organism seems to release a hormone that stimulates
the primitive regions of the brain that are normally dormant. I-I
have never seen anything like this on Earth.
DANIEL
Exactly. On Earth. That would explain the Touched.
HAMMOND
Beg your pardon?
TEAL'C
That's what the primitives were called on P3X-797. The Touched.
DANIEL
But I think, given recent events
(looks over at Carter, still restrained on the hospital bed)
I think it's safe to say they aren't born primitive, they must have
this very contagious disease, and we came in contact with them.
Isn't that special?
FRAISER
So, the question is: Why haven't you and Mr. Teal'c come down with
the symptoms?
DANIEL
Um, Mr. Teal'c's--Teal'c's symbiote probably protects him.
TEAL'C
That would be likely.
FRAISER
So what about you, Dr. Jackson?
DANIEL
Well, that beats me. You're the doctor, Doctor. Uh, maybe I have a
natural immunity.
TEAL'C
Perhaps you will develop symptoms later.
DANIEL
Thank you, for the moral support.
FRAISER
I am checking both of your blood for the presence of the organism,
and I would bet that you both have it. This appears to be highly
contagious.
HAMMOND
Are you saying we could have brought a new plague to this planet?
FRAISER
Yes sir, that's exactly what I'm saying.
HAMMOND
Well that's it. I'm ordering this mountain sealed off. No one comes
in or goes out until we get a handle on this thing.
[Hammond walks out. Teal'c, Fraiser, and Daniel run off in the
direction of a scream.]
INT--CORRIDOR--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
VOICE OVER SPEAKERS
Containment team three to sublevel 28.
[Teal'c, Fraiser and Daniel arrive at a door marked "IS-19." Teal'c
slides open the observation panel to see O'Neill screaming and slamming
against the door.]
TEAL'C
He is going to damage himself.
FRAISER
I've been pumping him with sedatives to control him, but they wear
off fast. Help me give him some more. Let's go, go!
[They rush into the room and Teal'c, Daniel and a soldier hold O'Neill
while Fraiser injects him with a sedative. O'Neill slowly collapses
against a bunk.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Soldiers rush up and begin sealing off the mountain.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[The red phone rings.]
HAMMOND
(into the phone)
Yes sir, this is General Hammond. Sir, I'm afraid I have a serious
situation here. It appears we've brought a very contagious disease
through the Stargate. Yes sir, that's right. Well sir, I've ordered
the mountain sealed off, but I think you should order in an armored
division to set up a second line of defense. Well sir, my
recommendation is that anyone attempting to leave the mountain
should be shot on sight, and the body burned.
INT--INFIRMARY--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Hammond walks in.]
FRAISER
Good news, General.
HAMMOND
Could use some of that around now. What is it?
[Fraiser indicates Daniel and Teal'c.]
FRAISER
These gentlemen don't appear to have the organism in their system.
Now, if we can just isolate why they've been able to resist it.
TEAL'C
Perhaps we should ask the Untouched how they avoid contracting the
disease.
DANIEL
Maybe they know something we don't.
FRAISER
I could use a blood sample from one of the uninfected, maybe they
have something in their systems to protect them. Something we can
synthesize.
HAMMOND
All right.
(waves at Teal'c and Daniel)
Either of you know how to draw blood?
[Daniel and Teal'c look back blankly.]
HAMMOND
Doctor, teach them. You go through in half an hour, gear up.
DANIEL
W--w--w--wait, wait. Just the...two of us?
HAMMOND
You're immune. I don't know anyone else who is!
INT--GATE ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Teal'c and Daniel walk in. Daniel sneezes.]
TEAL'C
Do not worry, Daniel Jackson, the Touched are frightened by your
loud, Earth weapons. We can easily subdue them.
DANIEL
That's easy for you to say.
[They step through the Gate.]
WORMHOLE EFFECTS
EXT--DARK SIDE--P3X-797
[Daniel puts a hand out to stop Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Teal'c.
[They come across a body lying on the side of the path.]
DANIEL
It's Melosha. She's alive.
TEAL'C
It appears she is afflicted.
DANIEL
So they just dump her out here?
[He starts to check Melosha over.]
TEAL'C
We dump them in a small room.
DANIEL
To protect them.
TEAL'C
To protect everyone else. There is little difference.
DANIEL
You know, you're right. They're like lepers. The dark side is a
leper colony.
TEAL'C
What is a leper?
DANIEL
God, never mind.
(pulls blanket out of pack)
We have to help her. Are you planning on helping me?
TEAL'C
It is a long journey. We should leave her.
DANIEL
No.
(picks up Melosha)
Now let's go.
[They are suddenly surrounded by the Touched.]
DANIEL
Teal'c!
TEAL'C
Fire your weapon. It will frighten them off.
[He fires his weapon. Daniel puts down Melosha, but before he can draw
his weapon, he is attacked by the Touched and he and Melosha are
dragged off.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson!
(turns around to find him gone)
Daniel! Daniel Jackson!
[Stoops and picks up Daniel's glasses from where they're lying on the
ground.]
INT--IS-19--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Hammond is brought in.]
FRAISER
Sorry Colonel O'Neill, but your private room just became
semi-private. We're running out of places to put all the victims.
We've used the brigs, we've used the temp quarters, some of the
storage rooms.
[She sighs and begins to walk out.]
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Doc. Doc?
FRAISER
D'you say something?
O'NEILL
(works mouth, grunts)
Give more...
FRAISER
What? Give more what?
O'NEILL
(grunts)
More.
[He pushes his arm forward.]
FRAISER
An injection? You mean you want more sedative?
(shakes head)
You've already had more than the maximum safe dosage, twice as much
as anyone else because you've been more violent.
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Give.
FRAISER
No. It's not safe.
O'NEILL
(grunts louder)
Give! Give.
FRAISER
Why are you so insistent?
[O'Neill just gazes back at her. She gives in and injects O'Neill who
seems to faint.]
FRAISER
Must have been in a lot of pain.
[Fraiser attempts to leave. O'Neill grunts very loudly.]
O'NEILL
Doc!
FRAISER
Colonel O'Neill?
[O'Neill attempts to speak.]
O'NEILL
Me.
FRAISER
(smiles)
So you are still in there somewhere.
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Dream? Dream?
FRAISER
I'm afraid not Colonel. It's very real. This is interesting. Enough
sedative must knock back the primitive mind. Colonel, listen to me.
I am not going to be able to keep you at this level for very long;
it is too dangerous. It could cause permanent brain damage.
O'NEILL
(struggles to speak)
What. What is it?
FRAISER
It's a parasitic virus. All we can tell is that is seems to mess
with body chemicals, all of them. Testosterone levels skyrocket thus
the aggressive behavior. It's histamine lytic which means it breaks
down histamine, we--wh--
O'NEILL
(breaking in; tries to speak)
Experiment on me.
FRAISER
Experiment on you? I'm sorry I can't do that.
[O'Neill touches her face.]
O'NEILL
(tries to speak)
Use me.
[Fraiser squeezes his hand and reluctantly agrees.]
EXT--MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE--LIGHT SIDE P3X-797
[Teal'c walks up to the temple.]
INT--MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE--LIGHT SIDE P3X-797
[Teal'c enters.]
TUPLO
Welcome back, my lord. Where are your friends?
TEAL'C
My friends are ill because of this place.
LEEDORA
They have joined the Touched.
TUPLO
They were cursed by the Heelk'sha.
TEAL'C
It is not a curse; it is a disease. I lost my friend on the dark
side of this planet. You must help me retrieve him.
TUPLO
Why? So he can give you the curse? So he can give all of us the
curse? No, no. He is better off where he is.
TEAL'C
He does not have the disease. He is immune. He is not cursed.
TUPLO
Then by now, he is gone.
TEAL'C
He had your daughter with him.
TUPLO
Melosha is dead.
TEAL'C
No, she is out there. On the dark side, I have seen her. Help me
retrieve her and my friend.
TUPLO
She is among the Touched, she can no longer function amongst us.
Therefore, she is dead!
TEAL'C
She is not dead.
TUPLO
If I believed otherwise, do you not think I would help my own
daughter?
LEEDORA
Many of us have loved ones among the Touched. My own father is
there, but we accept that we cannot help them. Therefore, they are
dead to us.
TEAL'C
How can you be so without heart?
TUPLO
I must ask you to leave.
TEAL'C
If you will not help me find my friend, then I must have a sample of
your blood.
LEEDORA
Our blood?
TUPLO
Blood is our lifeforce.
TEAL'C
I assure you it will cause you no harm.
LEEDORA
I cannot abide this one in my presence any longer.
[She stalks off.]
TUPLO
You are not welcome here. When we return, I expect to find you gone.
[He walks off. Teal'c pretends to leave, but just as he reaches the
entrance he knocks out both guards.]
TEAL'C
(kneels next to one of the guards)
I am sorry.
[He starts to withdraw blood from the guard.]
EXT--DARK SIDE--P3X-797
[A pack of the Touched are feeding around a fire. Daniel, clothes
already torn, attempts to get away but is jumped by a member of the
Touched who proceeds to beat him.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
[Guards pacing in front of the tunnel entrance.]
INT--INFIRMARY--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
VOICE OVER SPEAKERS
All personnel, be advised that the mountain is now under a code five
lockdown. The mountain is now under a code five lockdown.
[Teal'c walks in and sees Fraiser checking Carter.]
FRAISER
Thank god you're back.
TEAL'C
What happened to Captain Carter?
FRAISER
She was stabbed by her roommate. Don't worry it's superficial, she's
going to be okay.
[She leads Teal'c away.]
FRAISER
We've run out of space; we've had to start doubling up on the iso
rooms.
TEAL'C
I have retrieved the blood sample you requested.
FRAISER
Good work, Mr. Teal'c.
INT--IS-19--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I am afraid I lost Daniel Jackson on the dark side of the planet. I
am sorry.
[Fraiser walks in.]
FRAISER
Colonel O'Neill, I think I might have something.
[She grabs a chair and sits down.]
FRAISER
I was examining the blood sample that Mr. Teal'c brought me, then it
hit me. There was very little histamine in it.
[O'Neill looks at her, confused.]
FRAISER
If the people on that planet are human as you say, they have to have
a histamine in their blood.
TEAL'C
How does this help us?
FRAISER
Well as I said before, this microbe is a histaminolytic, it feeds on
histamine. The Untouched have no histamine in their bodies so the
organism couldn't survive in them.
TEAL'C
I do no understand. It is the Untouched that become the Touched. If
they have none of this substance of which you speak why then do some
of them change?
FRAISER
Because only some of them have this low histamine level which means
there is probably a-a naturally occurring antihistamine in their
diets. The ones who don't eat it eventually contract the organism.
Which is what gave me an idea. I checked the files; both Dr. Jackson
and I have acute rhinitis caused by severe allergies.
[O'Neill looks at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Explain.
FRAISER
I take strong antihistamines every day, so did Dr. Jackson. I have
no histamine for the microbe to feed on. Just like the Untouched,
the organism starves in my body.
TEAL'C
Does this mean you have a cure?
FRAISER
We have to try mega doses of chlorpheniramine maleate on someone and
see if it works.
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Me.
FRAISER
I thought you might say that. Now the dose required to completely
clear the body of histamine for a long enough time could be harmful.
You're sure?
[O'Neill nods. Fraiser injects the chemical into O'Neill's IV line.]
FRAISER
Now all we can do is wait.
(to Teal'c)
You better lock him up again.
[Teal'c lays O'Neill down and covers him with a blanket.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE IS-19--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[Teal'c is meditating outside the door.]
O'NEILL
(from inside)
Teal'c! Doc! Open the door! Teal'c!
TEAL'C
(Opens the observation panel to a normal-looking O'Neill)
Colonel O'Neill?
O'NEILL
(mimicking Ricky Ricardo)
Lucy, I'm home.
TEAL'C
I am not Lucy.
O'NEILL
I know that. It was a reference to an old TV--never mind, open the
door!
TEAL'C
I will summon the doctor.
O'NEILL
No, no, c'mon I'm fine, back to being myself. Just open up.
TEAL'C
I cannot be certain you are back to being yourself. You referred to
me as "Lucy."
O'NEILL
Oh for crying out loud, will you just open the door?
[Teal'c opens the door.]
O'NEILL
This stuff works. Let's find Doc.
INT--GATE ROOM--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[The Stargate is dialing up P3X-797.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
TECHNICIAN
Chevron three encoded.
[The technician looks up to see Hammond buttoning up his dress uniform,
cured of the virus.]
TECHNICIAN
Chevron four encoded.
INT--GATE ROOM
[SG-3 and SG-1 are gearing up. All look back to normal.]
FRAISER
The guns are loaded with tranquilizer darts filled with
chlorpheniramine now a direct hit on a Touched man or woman should
knock them out long enough in order to starve the disease. Good
luck.
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron five encoded.
O'NEILL
Thanks, Doc.
CARTER
So we're going to try and tranq all the Touched?
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron six encoded.
O'NEILL
Just the ones that get in the way of us finding Daniel. Leave the
rest for the Untouched.
CARTER
You think he's still alive?
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
Chevron seven, locked.
[O'Neill turns away from Carter and looks towards the Gate.]
O'NEILL
Let's find out.
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--DARK SIDE--P3X-797
[SG-1 and SG-3 surround a group of the Touched, including an obviously
Touched Daniel.]
CARTER
Guess the antihistamine wore off.
[She nods at where Daniel is sitting with Melosha. O'Neill gestures to
everyone and they open fire with the tranquilizer guns taking down
everyone but Daniel and Melosha. SG-1 walks over to them.]
O'NEILL
Daniel, you dog. Keep this up, you'll have a girl on every planet.
CARTER
Just let me give him an injection.
[She walks over to Daniel. Daniel attempts to jump Carter, and he and
Melosha are then shot with darts by the rest of the team.]
EXT--MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE FROM FAR OFF--LIGHT SIDE P3X-797
EXT--CLOSE SHOT OF MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE--LIGHT SIDE P3X-797
[SG-1 and SG-3 climb the stairs, Teal'c carrying Daniel over his
shoulders.]
INT--MINOAN STYLE TEMPLE--LIGHT SIDE P3X-797
[SG-1 and SG-3 walk up to Tuplo and his entourage.]
TUPLO
What are you doing?
LEEDORA
You must not bring the Touched among us. Leave now.
O'NEILL
Just hear us out, please?
CARTER
We found a cure, and we can bring back Melosha.
TEAL'C
And your father.
TUPLO
Put him in the isolation circle. We will hear you.
[Teal'c carries Daniel to the area Melosha had been lying in before.
The guards stop him.]
TUPLO
Let him pass.
[Teal'c continues and lays Daniel down.]
LATER
[Everyone is seated around the banquet table.]
TUPLO
If you are not gods, then how did you destroy the curse?
O'NEILL
As we've been saying, Tuplo, it's not a curse. It's a disease.
CARTER
A sickness.
DANIEL
Jack.
O'NEILL
There's our boy.
[O'Neill and Carter get up to join Teal'c where Daniel is lying. Daniel
sits up.]
DANIEL
Where are we?
TEAL'C
The light side of P3X-797.
[He hands Daniel his glasses.]
DANIEL
I thought we were going to give it a better name.
O'NEILL
(smiles)
He's back. He's normal.
LEEDORA
Explain.
CARTER
We know how to "lift the curse."
TUPLO
How? If you are not gods.
O'NEILL
Come out there with us. We'll show you.
EXT--DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN DARK AND LIGHT--P3X-797
[SG-1, SG-3, Tuplo, Leedora, and others from the Light side stand by
the edge of the woods. The Touched, now cured, begin to emerge from the
dark side.]
LEEDORA
(sees an older man)
Father.
[She runs and hugs him, crying. Tuplo sees Melosha and runs to hug her.
There is a reunion between the Touched and Untouched. Tuplo and Melosha
walk over to O'Neill and kneel before him.]
TUPLO
You have done it, my lord. Thank you.
O'NEILL
We'll teach you how to take care of the rest
[He helps Tuplo and Melosha up. SG-1 and SG-3 begin to walk away]
CARTER
Uh, sir?
O'NEILL
Yeah?
CARTER
About my earlier behavior. I wasn't myself, I--
O'NEILL
(breaking in)
Oh Carter, I don't even remember your earlier behavior.
CARTER
You don't?
O'NEILL
No, I was infected too, remember?
CARTER
Right. Good, I'm glad.
O'NEILL
By the way, how's the wound?
CARTER
Wound?
O'NEILL
I understand you got stabbed in the stomach or something?
CARTER
Oh! Yeah, it's nothing. With any luck there won't even be a scar.
O'NEILL
Oh, good. I was concerned.
CARTER
You were?
O'NEILL
Sure. If it doesn't heal properly, you'll never wear that sweet
little tank top number again.
[O'Neill walks off, leaving Carter looking after him, bemused.]
FADE OUT
