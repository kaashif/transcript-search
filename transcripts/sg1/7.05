TEASER
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[The sirens indicating an active Gate are sounding. Daniel comes into
the control room and approaches Carter, who is sitting and controlling
the MALP. He leans in to look at the screen, which is showing the video
feed from the MALP.]
DANIEL
What's going on?
CARTER
We're getting MALP telemetry from P3X--289. Atmosphere is completely
toxic: sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia.
DANIEL
Well, if there was a Gate there, then chances are good there was
life there at some point.
CARTER
Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption. Look at this.
[Video feed from the MALP is on the computer monitor of what appears to
be a fuzzy dome in the middle of a white fog. There are rocky
outcroppings surrounding the fog and protruding from the foggy area.
The MALP's arm can be seen in the top right corner.]
CARTER
We got these images two hour ago, just after the MALP went through.
The dome seems to be the only structure that's managed to withstand
the corrosive effects of the atmosphere.
DANIEL
How big is it?
CARTER
It's about 2.2 kilometres wide and 500 meters high.
[Daniel looks at Carter, somewhat astonished.]
SGT DAVIS
The MALP's giving us a proximity alert. Three meters, and we're
picking up a static charge.
[Video feed from the MALP is shown. The MALP's arm is clearly visible,
and beyond it a snowy haze, similar to interference on a TV arm on the
monitor.]
CARTER
Stop. Extend the arm.
[We see the arm extend and it appears to push through a barrier of some
kind. There is a bit of a rainbow shimmer as it passes through the
barrier. The part of the arm that is through the barrier is no longer
visible.]
SGT DAVIS
It went right through.
DANIEL
Well, whatever it is, it's not solid.
CARTER
Move forward.
[On the monitor the map moves forward, through the barrier. After
initial interference, the image clears to reveal a green park area,
with decidious and evergreen trees, blue sky, and a reddish stone
sculpture in the foreground. Carter and Daniel both watch the MALP
progress intently. Then the monitor goes black.]
SGT DAVIS
Uh, we've lost contact. The MALP's not responding.
CARTER
Bring up that last image.
[The monitor shows the parkland scene, with sculpture in the
foreground, and a large pond a few metres in front.]
DANIEL
How is that possible?
CARTER
I have no idea.
[Daniel looks behind him at the monitors hanging above to check they
are showing the same image. Both he and Carter look amazed.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Sirens continue to sound as the 'Gate is active. General Hammond walks
up to stand behind Sgt. Davis, who is operating the 'Gate.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, report.
[SG1 are on the alien planet. There are several steel girders sticking
up from the ground. SG1 are in full hazmat suits. O'Neill leads, his
P-90 at the ready. Carter is holding scientific instruments, taking
readings from the atmosphere.]
O'NEILL
We're good, Sir. Although, there's not much of a view.
HAMMOND
What about suit integrity?
CARTER
According to my readings, the hazmats could withstand about twelve
hours of exposure before there was any serious degradation.
O'NEILL
Shouldn't be a problem, Sir. We can make it to the dome and back
inside an hour.
HAMMOND
Understood, Hammond out.
[The Gate disengages.]
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[SG-1, in red suits, hoods, breathing apparatus, etc. are walking
through a very dense fog or smoke. The fog has a slight brown tint to
it. There is little visibility, though remains of structures and trees
can be seen when they are in close proximity to the team.]
CARTER
Picking up a static charge.
DANIEL
Yeah, I can feel it.
[They arrive at the forcefield, which is a hazy blue color. SG-1 stop
in front of it.]
O'NEILL
So, what do we do, just walk through?
CARTER
The MALP encountered no resistance.
O'NEILL
Then it disappeared.
CARTER
It did transmit for a few seconds before we lost the signal, which
suggests it got through.
[O'Neill unhooks his P--90 and extends it through the barrier for a few
seconds. He pulls it back. Then he walks right through. Once through,
he is in a beautiful landscape. He sees what the MALP transmitted just
before they lost contact with it. He walks up to the MALP looking
behind him. There is no evidence of the barrier, the landscape seems to
carry on past it. A few seconds later the rest of SG-1 comes through
the barrier, appearing in the park as if from nowhere.]
CARTER
I'm reading normal atmosphere. Oxygen, nitrogen...
(She turns her scanning device toward Daniel)
We're clean too.
DANIEL
It's like the barrier scrubbed the suits when we passed through.
CARTER
The inside of the barrier seems to be some kind of hologram.
[She reaches her hand back in the direction they came from and where
she touches the barrier, the landscape seems to blur. Daniel sticks his
whole forearm back through the barrier, and it promptly disappears. He
pulls it back through.]
DANIEL
You can feel the resistance.
CARTER
That combined with the static charge must act as a warning.
[She pulls off her hood.]
CARTER
So you don't accidentally step through.
[O'Neill pulls off his hood too and takes a look around. Teal'c takes
off his hood as well and does a quick check of the MALP.]
TEAL'C
The MALP appears to be fully operational.
CARTER
The barrier must block the signal. Sir, this is an amazing piece of
technology. Permeable to large solid objects, but won't allow the
poisonous atmosphere in. We really need to study this further.
[Carter and O'Neill continue to walk away from the MALP with Teal'c and
Daniel bringing up the rear. Then they hear a twig snap. O'Neill uses a
hand signal to tell the other's to hang back while he investigates. He
walks toward a large pine tree, weapon raised.]
O'NEILL
All right, come on out. Let's go.
[A young boy walks out from behind the tree. He pulls down on a branch
to look over it at the strangers. O'Neill puts his gun down. Carter
smiles.]
CARTER
Hello.
DANIEL
We're not going to hurt you.
NEVIN
You came from outside.
O'NEILL
Yes, we did. What's your name?
NEVIN
What's yours?
O'NEILL
I asked you first.
NEVIN
I'm called Nevin.
O'NEILL
Hello, Nevin. I'm Jack. That's Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.
NEVIN
You wear strange clothes.
O'NEILL
Caught us on a bad day.
CARTER
Nevin, where are your parents?
NEVIN
My father's in the town.
CARTER
Can you show us?
DANIEL
We just want to talk to him.
NEVIN
Maybe we could trade.
EXT--ALIEN TOWN
[SG-1 have taken off their hazmat suits and are walking into a small
town. The camera pans out to reveal Nevin up ahead of them wearing one
of the suits, carrying the protective hood, and proudly wearing
O'Neill's baseball cap. He leads them into the town.]
CARTER
You know, Sir, we probably could have found the town without his
help.
[They follow Nevin into the town square. The streets are cobbled, and
the houses are made mostly of red brick. There are lots of flowers
hannging in baskets, in tubs on the floor. Several people are sat at
tables, having a mid morning drink and chat. They stop and stare at
SG-1. Nevin approaches his father. Nevin's father seems to be running a
fruit and veg stall. He has a c shaped metallic object on the side of
his face near his left temple, as do all the adults in the square.]
KENDRICK
Nevin?
NEVIN
I found some people in the garden: Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.
KENDRICK
I'm Kendrick, Nevin's father.
O'NEILL
I assume you don't get many visitors in these parts.
KENDRICK
We thought we were the only survivors.
DANIEL
Survivors of what, exactly?
KENDRICK
You'd better speak to the Council.
INT--COUNCIL CHAMBER
[SG--1 are standing in the room which has windows all around. It seems
most of the townspeople are there, they have surrounded the building
and are looking in through the windows, trying to see what is going on.
There are three men and one woman seated at a table in front of SG-1.]
COUNCIL MAN 1
You say you came from outside the dome?
O'NEILL
That's right.
COUNCIL MAN 2
But the atmosphere is toxic. Anyone who stepped outside would die
almost instantly.
CARTER
We wore protective suits.
COUNCIL WOMAN
But where do you come from, originally?
CARTER
From a planet called Earth. It's about 6000 light years from here.
COUNCIL MAN 3
You came in a spaceship?
DANIEL
Uh, no, we came through the Stargate. It's that, that big circular
object, uh, symbols carved on it. It's right outside the dome.
[The council members stare blankly back at him.]
DANIEL
There must be some sort of historical reference to...
COUNCIL MAN 4
One moment, please.
[He reaches his fingers up to touch the device on his temple. All the
citizens stop, as though in suspended animation. SG-1 look around, a
little spooked by this. Then seconds later, he resumes talking.]
COUNCIL MAN 4
The Gate of Magh Mar. Discovered 563 years ago.
COUNCIL MAN 3
Believed to have been of ritual significance in the worship of the
goddess Morrigan.
COUNCIL WOMAN
Taken from the ruins of Danaan and put on display in the national
museum of history.
CARTER
So, you do know about the Gate.
COUNCIL WOMAN
We do now.
COUNCIL MAN 4
We've accessed the relevant information through the link. It's a
direct neural interface with a databank.
(He removes the device from his temple and holds it in his hand for
SG--1 to see.)
O'NEILL
(Grimaces)
Ow.
COUNCIL WOMAN
The link contains the sum total of our knowledge and wisdom. All our
history, our culture, our science, everything.
CARTER
And you can simply call up this information whenever you need it?
COUNCIL WOMAN
Precisely.
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[O'Neill and Teal'c are back in the garden. They are walking to the
MALP.]
O'NEILL
You really think this is going to work?
TEAL'C
The signal was lost only when the transmitter crossed the barrier.
We need only manoeuvre the MALP into the correct position.
[O'Neill holds Teal'c's staff weapon as Teal'c uses a remote control to
move the MALP back through the barrier far enough that the transmitter
is on the outside of the dome. He looks at O'Neill, signaling that they
are ready to receive a transmission from the SGC.]
O'NEILL
Nice.
[He gives Teal'c back his staff weapon.]
SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[Meanwhile back in the SGC control room, the alarms are going off
because the Gate is going to be active again. Sgt. Davis and General
Hammond walk toward the computer console from separate areas.]
SGT DAVIS
We have a scheduled radio contact with SG--1, Sir.
HAMMOND
Dial the 'Gate.
[Back on the planet, O'Neill is swinging his arms as he awaits the
transmission.]
HAMMOND
(Over the MALP radio)
SG--1, this is General Hammond. Come in.
[O'Neill leans his face into the camera, filling the computer screen
with his face.]
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir. We read ya, loud and clear.
[He whips his sunglasses off. He has a distinct drawl in his voice.]
O'NEILL
Loud and clear.
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, report.
O'NEILL
Well, it turns out this planet's not so dead after all, Sir.
HAMMOND
I take it the dome's inhabited.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir. So far, the natives are very friendly, if, a bit odd, if
you know what I mean.
HAMMOND
Are they willing to share information?
O'NEILL
They're going to show Carter all the technical stuff tomorrow. In
the meantime, they've offered to put us up for the night.
HAMMOND
All right, next contact in twenty-four hours.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
[He salutes.]
INT--KENDRICK'S HOUSE--NIGHT
[O'Neill, Teal'c and Nevin are seated at a dining table and Kendrick is
putting bowls on the table. Teal'c nods at Kendrick and then Kendrick
goes into the kitchen. O'Neill looks at his bowl, then looks at
Teal'c's as Teal'c watches. A few seconds later, O'Neill signals Teal'c
to trade bowls with him. Nevin just stares at O'Neill as he prepares to
eat the meal Kendrick has prepared. Then O'Neill notices him staring,
so he stares back. Then Teal'c notices O'Neill staring.]
O'NEILL
(To Nevin)
What?
NEVIN
How many planets have you been to?
O'NEILL
I don't know. Lots.
NEVIN
More than ten?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
NEVIN
More than twenty?
O'NEILL
Yes.
NEVIN
More than thirty?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
NEVIN
More than forty?
O'NEILL
Yes.
NEVIN
More than fifty?
O'NEILL
Maybe.
KENDRICK
(Peeking into the room)
Nevin, let the poor man eat.
NEVIN
It's more than fifty, isn't it?
O'NEILL
(Quietly to Teal'c)
Think it's too late to pitch a tent?
INT--PALLAN'S HOUSE--NIGHT
[Meanwhile, Carter and Daniel are seated in another home at another
dinner table.]
PALLAN
Are you sure you've had enough to eat?
DANIEL
Yes, it was, uh, it was delicious.
CARTER
You obviously don't have any trouble growing enough food.
EVALLA
Everything in the dome is completely self--sufficient.
CARTER
What about power?
PALLAN
We draw energy from geo-thermal vents located beneath the town.
Tomorrow I can show you the, the generators.
EVALLA
(proudly taking hold of Pallan's hand)
Pallan's one of the technicians who maintains the system.
DANIEL
Well, you're obviously very advanced, but your level of architecture
seems to be out of step with your level of technology.
EVALLA
Technology's what destroyed our world. The dome was created because
industrial growth poisoned the air and the water. Our people were
dying from disease and starvation so, the survivors made a
deliberate choice to simplify their lives.
DANIEL
We have our own environmental problems. Perhaps if we learned about
your history, it might help us avoid a similar fate.
EVALLA
Well, the easiest way for you to learn about our history is through
the link.
[Daniel and Carter look at each other. Then Daniel turns back to
Evalla.]
DANIEL
Is that possible?
EVALLA
Of course.
[She takes her temple device off and hands it to Daniel.]
EVALLA
Thousands of historical books are on file.
[Daniel looks the device over.]
CARTER
Uh, maybe that isn't such a good idea.
[Pallan and Evalla look at her, puzzled.]
CARTER
We have no way of knowing if our brain physiology if compatible with
the technology.
PALLAN
Ah.
DANIEL
(Handing the device back to Evalla)
Thanks, maybe later.
[Elsewhere in the town, the Council Woman is sleeping in her bed.
Suddenly, she wakes up and the device is still on her temple. Tiny
lights on it have started flashing. She gets out of bed, picks up a
suitcase, puts it on the bed and kneels down as she opens it. Then she
looks up. She exits her home, dressed and carrying the suitcase. She
walks down and ally and through the barrier, into the toxic wasteland
beyond.]
INT--KENDRICK'S HOUSE--MORNING
[O'Neill wakes to see his hazmat helmet staring him in the face.]
O'NEILL
Hello, Nevin.
NEVIN
I'm not Nevin. I'm Colonel O'Neill from Stargate Command.
O'NEILL
All right, Colonel O'Neill.
[He sits up and flicks the face plate on the mask.]
O'NEILL
Will you please take off my hood?
[Nevin complies and then his dad comes into the room. Teal'c is sitting
in a chair in the same room.]
KENDRICK
Nevin, it's time for school. Go into your room and access your
lessons.
NEVIN
When I grow up, can I be an explorer?
KENDRICK
We'll talk about it later.
[Elsewhere in the town, Carter and Pallan are walking.]
CARTER
So none of you has ever been outside the dome?
PALLAN
Not in over four hundred years. We monitor the levels of toxicity,
but we've never actually seen it. What's it like?
CARTER
It's not very pretty.
PALLAN
I've seen images on the link of a great city with tall building made
of glass and steel.
CARTER
I'm afraid there's not much left but rubble.
PALLAN
I suppose that's why they created this.
[He throws the rock down a short arched tunnel. More of the town can be
seen through the tunnel, but the rock passes through the barrier and it
becomes obvious the barrier is closer than Carter had thought.]
PALLAN
So we're not constantly reminded of what happened.
CARTER
It's a pretty convincing illusion. I'd love to see how it's made.
PALLAN
Well, the control room's underground, but the entrance is this way.
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Pallan descend a staircase into the control room. There are
several computer monitors in a bank on one side of the room, all
showing different readouts. The main console is in the middle of the
room. It has computer monitors, keyboards and several interface points.
Above are large transparent panels, with swirls and designs.]
PALLAN
As you can see, Major, we haven't abandoned technology altogether.
CARTER
Yeah.
INT--TOWN SQUARE
[Daniel and Evalla walk over to the archive building.]
EVALLA
If using the link is out of the question, then this is your only
option.
[She opens the door to a room that is filled with books. There are
books on shelves and books stacked on every available horizontal
surface. It appears as though no one has disturbed a one of them in a
very long time.]
EVALLA
Mmm, we don't have much need for books anymore.
[She picks one up and starts to flick through it.]
EVALLA
These are all that's left from the old world.
DANIEL
It's interesting, um, the writing's similar to a language we've
encountered before.
EVALLA
Can you translate it?
DANIEL
With your help?
EVALLA
Let's get started.
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Pallan is showing Carter around.]
PALLAN
Atmospheric analysis, dome integrity, power utilization.
CARTER
Very impressive.
PALLAN
If you don't mind, I just have to check the coolant pressure.
Please.
[He gestures, inviting Carter to further examine the displays he has
just shown her. He walks to another console. As she is looking at the
three displays, suddenly all three go black and then white writing
appears on the screen--similar to machine code. The same code is on all
three monitors.]
CARTER
Pallan?
[She turns to look at him, he doesn't respond.]
INT--ARCHIVE
DANIEL
This looks like some kind of religious text, Evalla?
[She is sitting in a chair, motionless, staring off into space. Daniel
puts a hand on her shoulder.]
DANIEL
Evalla?
[Back in the control room, Carter has not gotten a response from
Pallan, who is still standing still with his back toward Carter.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Pallan?
[She turns her attention back to the displays. Suddenly, they all
return to normal.]
INT--ARCHIVE
[Evalla suddenly comes out of her trance. She looks at Daniel's hand
and then up at Daniel.]
EVALLA
Yes?
DANIEL
You okay?
EVALLA
Of course. Let me see.
[Daniel hands her the book he is holding. He looks concerned.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[In the control room, Pallan finishes checking his readings and walks
back to Carter.]
CARTER
Did you see that?
PALLAN
See what?
CARTER
The screens changed. They were filled with some sort of streaming
code.
PALLAN
That's impossible. They always display the status of these specific
systems.
CARTER
Uh, I know what I saw, Pallan.
PALLAN
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
[He walks back to the other console.]
EXT--TOWN PARK
[Carter and Daniel meet O'Neill and Teal'c in the park.]
O'NEILL
So, what do we know?
CARTER
Well, their technology's incredible. At least what's left of it.
Right now, Pallan and I are trying to rig up a computer interface so
I can download some of the specs.
[They notice people walking very near by. This prompts O'Neill to walk
away from them. The rest of SG-1 follows.]
TEAL'C
Do they wish anything in return?
CARTER
Apparently not. They seem quite happy with their situation as it is.
O'NEILL
Now, see, that makes no sense to me. These people live in a bubble.
DANIEL
Well, they have managed to survive for over four hundred years.
TEAL'C
Sometimes there is more to life than mere survival.
CARTER
We could offer them relocation.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I s'pose.
INT--COUNCIL CHAMBER
[Today there are only the three male Council members present.]
COUNCIL MAN 2
Are you suggesting we leave the dome?
O'NEILL
We're just saying it's possible.
TEAL'C
There are many suitable worlds where your people could live.
COUNCIL MAN 3
But we have everything we need right here.
CARTER
Except room to grow.
DANIEL
We're talking about fresh water, fresh air, mountains, trees...
COUNCIL MAN 1
We can experience all these things through the link.
O'NEILL
You got to be kiddin' me.
COUNCIL MAN 4
It is a very generous offer, Colonel, but this is our home.
O'NEILL
What about the other folks in the town? Some of them have to think
differently.
COUNCIL MAN 4
The Council speaks for the town, and the Council's decision is
unanimous.
DANIEL
Well, what about the other Council member? The woman that was here?
COUNCIL MAN 4
Uh, there hasn't been a woman on the Council since the last
election, and that was two years ago.
O'NEILL
What're you talkin' about? There was a woman sittin' there
yesterday.
COUNCIL MAN 1
Colonel, I cn assure you the Council has always consisted of three
members.
[The three Council members look at each other and then back to SG-1 in
unison. SG-1 turn to look at each other in disbelief.]
EXT--TOWN SQUARE
[Carter catches up with the rest of SG-1 in the town square.]
CARTER
I spoke to Pallan. He claims to have no memory of there ever being a
fourth Council member.
DANIEL
She was just there yesterday.
CARTER
Maybe the link has something to do with this. If it can be used to
download information directly into people's brains, maybe it can
also be used to alter their perceptions or memories.
TEAL'C
Perhaps the Councilwoman opposed the others and they felt it
necessary to be rid of her.
DANIEL
So they erased her from existence? That seems a little harsh, don't
you think?
O'NEILL
Well, the bottom line is, we can't trust these people.
CARTER
Well, Sir, I'd still like to finish my research on the dome
technology.
DANIEL
Yeah, maybe there's something in the archive that can shed some
light on this.
TEAL'C
The behaviour of the townspeople does seem odd, but they don't
appear to be an immediate threat.
O'NEILL
All right, see what you can find out.
[Carter and Daniel leave.]
INT--ARCHIVE
[Evalla comes in while Daniel is still perusing books.]
EVALLA
How's it coming?
DANIEL
Well, I still can't find any historical reference to the time period
when the dome was first created.
EVALLA
By that time our people had begun using the link. It's possible not
much written material survives from that era.
DANIEL
Let me ask you something, um, if you had the chance to-to leave the
dome and, uh, and go live on another planet, would you take it?
EVALLA
Pallan told me about the conversation you had with the Council.
DANIEL
Ah, and?
EVALLA
We have everything we need right here.
DANIEL
That's what they said.
EVALLA
We hope that some day, the poison in the outside atmosphere will
dissipate and we'll be able to reclaim the planet.
DANIEL
But not in your lifetime.
EVALLA
No.
DANIEL
What about, children? I mean, don't you and Pallan want to have a
family?
EVALLA
Of course.
DANIEL
But there must be some sort of population control.
EVALLA
Each couple's allowed a maximum of two children.
DANIEL
And you're okay with that?
EVALLA
Limited resources dictate that we maintain the population at a
certain level.
DANIEL
How many people are we talking about here, exactly?
EVALLA
At this precise moment? One thousand, three hundred and
seventy-three.
DANIEL
And what would happen if someone, y'know, decided to break the rules
and have more than two children?
EVALLA
I don't know. No one ever has.
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Carter has her laptop hooked up to a panel. The panel has many wires
coming out of it, and Carter seems to be testing some of them in an
effort to complete her interface. Pallan is working on the opposite
side of the panel.]
PALLAN
Try the interface now.
CARTER
We got it.
[Pallan walks around and sits down next to Carter.]
PALLAN
You believe this technology will be useful on your world?
CARTER
Why don't you and your wife come back with us and see for
yourselves?
PALLAN
Oh.
[He seems unsure.]
CARTER
Just for a visit.
PALLAN
Do you have oceans?
CARTER
Oceans, deserts, rainforests, it would take a lifetime to see it
all.
PALLAN
It sounds wonderful.
CARTER
Wait a minute,
(pointing to her laptop)
You said these were the power utilization figures, right?
PALLAN
That's right.
CARTER
What's a normal variation?
PALLAN
Between .01 and .07 percent.
CARTER
Well, then we've got a problem. These levels are least two percent
lower than when we first came down here.
PALLAN
No, that can't be.
[He gets up and goes to his own power utilization display.]
PALLAN
No, you're mistaken. These figures are within normal range.
CARTER
Do you have the readings from this morning?
PALLAN
Of course.
[He brings up the readings.]
PALLAN
You see? No variation.
CARTER
This is wrong.
PALLAN
These measurements are foreign to you.
CARTER
Well, it doesn't mean I can't recognize a relative drop.
PALLAN
Major, I can access four hundred years of recorded power utilization
figures on the link. There's never been more than a 0.1% variation.
CARTER
Hypothetically speaking, if there was, would it threaten the
integrity of the force field?
PALLAN
I suppose it might. But it's never come up.
ETX--TOWN PARK. DAY
[O'Neill and Teal'c are making their way to the MALP for another
transmission to the SGC. Kendrick comes running up behind them.]
KENDRICK
Colonel O'Neill! Colonel, is it true, what they're saying? You've
offered to take us through the Gate to another world?
O'NEILL
Yeah, that's right.
KENDRICK
Then Nevin and I will come with you. I see the way he is with you
and I realize that Nevin deserves the chance for much more than this
world can ever offer.
TEAL'C
Are you certain? This is not a decision to be taken lightly.
KENDRICK
I want my son to grow up in a world where the sky and the clouds
aren't part of an illusion created by a computer.
O'NEILL
Well, that's good enough for me.
[Kendrick nods and smiles.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is still working with the new interface.]
CARTER
(Into her radio)
Colonel, come in.
O'NEILL
(Over the radio)
Go ahead.
CARTER
Sir, I've been running some calculations here and I've discovered
something.
[We see O'Neill and Teal'c walking toward where the MALP was parked.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
[The MALP has disappeared.]
CARTER
(Over the radio)
Sir, are you reading me?
O'NEILL
(Into his radio)
Carter, the MALP's gone.
CARTER
Say again?
O'NEILL
The MALP is no longer parked where we parked it.
TEAL'C
It would appear someone does not wish us to communicate with
Stargate Command.
CARTER
Well, that's not our only problem. The dome is losing power. I
noticed a discrepancy with the output levels, but I wasn't sure
because the computer record showed no change. So, I converted the
units and compared the current levels with the readings I took
yesterday when we first came through.
O'NEILL
And?
CARTER
In the last twenty--four hours, there's been almost a four percent
drop. Sir, if this continues, the dome will fail.
O'NEILL
How much time?
CARTER
It's hard to say. But when it does, everyone here will die.
[Carter is still in the control room. Suddenly, the computer monitors
do the same thing they did earlier. They go black and then the same
streaming code appears on all the screens at the same time. In the book
room, Evalla gets a strange look on her face. She turns and walks
outside. Daniel is startled from the book he's concentrating on as he
hears the door open.]
DANIEL
Evalla?
[She does not respond, but continues on her way.
[In the control room, Carter notices the screen and goes to her laptop
to check the power utilization readout.]
CARTER
(Into her radio)
Sir, the computer's giving me new information. The power level is
definitely dropping.
TEAL'C
(Over the radio)
Major Carter, should we not warn the townspeople?
CARTER
I'm not sure we're going to be able to convince them. The only
evidence we have are the computer readings and, for some reason,
Pallan couldn't see that they were changing.
O'NEILL
Maybe he's in on it.
CARTER
I don't think so. I think his memories are being altered and it's
possible that the same holds true for everyone in this town.
EXT--TOWN SQUARE
[Daniel is following after Evalla.]
DANIEL
Evalla!
[He picks up the pace to try an catch her.]
DANIEL
Evalla!
[She continues as though she hasn't heard him. She goes down narrowed
passage and then takes a left. Daniel continues to follow. Up ahead, he
sees her turn right and then she is obscured from his view. When he
rounds the corner he sees a covered entrance to a building. There is a
door on the left at the end of the entrance. Straight ahead is an
arched area which echoes the arch he has just passed through, but it
has been walled off with bricks. There is a door to his left, and a set
of windows to his right. There is no sign of Evalla. He continues to
the door and tries to open it. It will not open. He then walks to the
bricked in wall and discovers that it is the barrier of the dome,
similar to what Pallan showed Carter earlier. He turns and frowns with
obvious concern.]
INT--PALLAN'S HOUSE
[The interior is pretty dark and backlit by open windows. O'Neill,
Carter, Teal'c and Daniel are talking.]
DANIEL
And I called out to her and she just ignored me. It was like she was
in some sort of trance or something.
TEAL'C
Perhaps she was under the influence of the link.
CARTER
There's no telling what level of manipulation is possible.
O'NEILL
So, brainwashing?
CARTER
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
DANIEL
We have to help these people. I mean, they're being held against
their will, they don't even know it.
O'NEILL
Well, as long as they've got those, things on their faces, they're
not going to be convinced of anything.
TEAL'C
Is it possible to disable the link?
CARTER
It's part of the same computer system that controls the dome. If we
tamper with it, we risk bringing the whole force field down. On the
other hand, if I could use the computer to access the link, maybe I
could reprogram the information that's being sent out.
DANIEL
You mean do a little brainwashing of our own.
CARTER
The only problem is, I don't think I could do it without Pallan's
help.
DANIEL
If I can find historical evidence in the library that directly
contradicts information available on the link, that might prove to
at least some of these people that they're being lied to.
CARTER
Like records of the Council meetings. They would show that there
used to be more than three members.
DANIEL
Exactly.
[Daniel looks at O'Neill. O'Neill seems to realize that they're
finished, almost like he just woke out of his own trance.]
O'NEILL
All right, you two do what you do.
[He looks at his watch.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, you and I are late for a radio contact.
[Teal'c picks up his staff weapon and follows O'Neill out. O'Neill and
Teal'c walk down one of the passages in the town. They pass by an
intersecting passage and Nevin comes running down that passage.]
NEVIN
Colonel O'Neill! Where are you going?
O'NEILL
We're going back to the house. We need those special outfits we had.
NEVIN
The house is this way.
TEAL'C
You are mistaken.
(Teal'c turns his head toward the direction they had been
heading--directly in front of Nevin)
TEAL'C
It is in that direction.
NEVIN
There's nothing over there. That's the edge of the dome.
[O'Neill and Teal'c look at each other.]
NEVIN
Come on, I'll show you.
[They follow Nevin.]
INT--KENDRICK'S HOUSE
[Nevin opens a door and lead the pair in. He goes over to a trunk in the
room.]
NEVIN
Here it is. See? Right where you left it.
[Nevin brings the suit to O'Neill. O'Neill and Teal'c look a bit
perplexed. Teal'c walks to the door at the front and looks out. The
house does not appear as it did before. O'Neill takes off his cap and
scratches his head.]
O'NEILL
(To Teal'c)
Hey, is this where we slept last night?
TEAL'C
It is not.
[O'Neill looks back at Nevin.]
O'NEILL
What's goin' on here?
[Just then, Kendrick arrives through the door they entered earlier.]
KENDRICK
Colonel, are you going back to Earth now?
O'NEILL
No. We were just going to send a message. Don't worry, we're not
leavin' without ya.
KENDRICK
Excuse me?
O'NEILL
Anyone who wants to leave is welcome to come with us.
KENDRICK
Why would I leave?
TEAL'C
You have expressed a desire to live in a world where the sky was not
artificial.
KENDRICK
You must have me mistaken for someone else.
[Teal'c and O'Neill look at each other.]
O'NEILL
Nevin, you wanted to be an explorer, right?
NEVIN
I'm going to be a gardener, like my father.
TEAL'C
You are under the influence of the link.
KENDRICK
What are you talking about?
O'NEILL
Those things on your head, you got to lose 'em.
KENDRICK
No, no.
O'NEILL
Yes, they're messin' with your mind somehow. You've got to, get rid
of them.
KENDRICK
The link gives us everything we need.
O'NEILL
Look, just, take it off for a minute. Just flick it off.
KENDRICK
I can't. To be disconnected from the link would cause instant death.
O'NEILL
Now, see, that's something you've never said before.
KENDRICK
Colonel, I think you should leave now.
EXT--TOWN SQUARE, DAY
[Carter is walking through the square.]
O'NEILL
(Over the radio)
Carter, what's your status?
CARTER
(Into her radio)
I'm on my way to the control room now.
O'NEILL
Well, watch yourself. They got to Kendrick.
[She looks around her and picks up the pace.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Carter walks down the stairs into the control room. Pallan is there.]
PALLAN
Major, I've almost finished downloading the generator design.
CARTER
Pallan, we need to talk.
PALLAN
All right.
CARTER
Do you remember earlier today, I told you I noticed a drop in the
power levels?
PALLAN
I remember you being mistaken.
CARTER
What about now? Do you notice any change?
PALLAN
(He looks back at the monitor)
Power levels are constant.
CARTER
No, they're not. It's just that every time these screens are
updated, the information on the link is updated as well. It alters
your memory so you don't see what's happening.
PALLAN
Major, this is absurd.
CARTER
Pallan, the dome is failing.
PALLAN
I told you you're mistaken.
CARTER
No! I am not mistaken. Now, if you don't help me warn the others,
then you and Evalla and everyone in this city will die.
PALLAN
Who?
CARTER
Evalla, your wife.
PALLAN
Major, I don't know what's come over you but... I've never been
married.
INT--TOWN ARCHIVE
[Daniel is looking through documents. He picks up a rather large set
and starts looking through it. It appears he has found something he can
use and he leaves quickly.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
I need you to disconnect yourself from the link.
PALLAN
That's insane.
CARTER
I know that you believe that removing that node from your forehead
will kill you.
PALLAN
I've known that since childhood.
CARTER
But last night, Evalla removed hers and nothing happened.
PALLAN
(Getting more irritated)
Who is this Evalla?
CARTER
(Equally as frustrated)
I told you. She's your wife.
PALLAN
Ack.
CARTER
Your memories of her have been altered in the same way that you've
been kept from realizing that the dome is deteriorating.
PALLAN
Major?
CARTER
At first, I thought it was somebody on the Council who was
responsible, but the changes are happening too quickly. I think it's
automatic. The computer makes changes and then updates the memories
of everyone in this town so no one's the wiser. Pallan, you have to
disconnect.
PALLAN
That would be suicide.
CARTER
No! That's just a lie that's been planted by the computer. We need
to reprogram the link to convince the others of what's happening,
but I can't do it without you.
PALLAN
No.
DANIEL
Sam!
[Daniel comes down the stairs into the control room.]
DANIEL
Got it.
PALLAN
What is that?
DANIEL
They're legal documents. All I can say is thank God for lawyers.
When everyone else was converting to the link, they were still using
good, old-fashioned paper.
[He pulls out a few documents.]
DANIEL
See, when the dome was first created, everyone signed a contract
establishing communal land ownership rights.
[He puts a piece of paper in front of Pallan.]
DANIEL
Look at the number.
PALLAN
No, that can't be.
DANIEL
There were originally over a hundred thousand people living here.
PALLAN
That's impossible. The dome isn't big enough to sustain that many.
DANIEL
Not any more.
CARTER
Oh, my God. All this time, I thought the power loss would cause the
dome to fail. But the computer found a way to compensate. The dome
is shrinking.
DANIEL
See, that's what happened to the MALP. It didn't go anywhere. It's
right where we left it, except for now it's on the outside.
PALLAN
Now, wait a minute, if there were over hundred thousand people
living here, where did they all go?
[Daniel gives him a look. He then turns to look at Carter who raises
her brows like she just got it.]
EXT--OUTSIDE DOME
[Teal'c and O'Neill are back in hazmats, walking through the fog.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
[O'Neill joins Teal'c and kneels down to look at the bones Teal'c has
pointed out. They are human remains. They move on.]
TEAL'C
There are other remains here but the bones have been eaten away by
the corrosive atmosphere.
[O'Neill notices something and picks it up. It is one of the link
devices.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
I understand why you're reluctant to believe us, Pallan. You've got
things in your head that must seem like memories of a lifetime, but
they're not. Just yesterday, you'd never even heard of the idea that
disconnecting from the link could be fatal.
PALLAN
You're lying.
DANIEL
Look at these documents. They're over four hundred years old,
they're written in your language. How could we fake this? Why would
be fake this? The only reason they still exist is because the
computer did not foresee outside interference. To anyone on the
link, they're completely irrelevant.
PALLAN
But why?
CARTER
The computer is programmed to maintain the community. Individuals
had to be sacrificed for the good of the whole. Only each time
someone disappeared, no one noticed because all memory of them was
erased. Please.
PALLAN
No.
CARTER
It's all right.
[She reaches out to take the device.]
PALLAN
No, I...
[He raises his hand up, but doesn't stop her. She removes the link and
he looks stunned that he's still alive.]
CARTER
You see? Now, we need your help.
LATER
O'NEILL
(Over the radio)
Carter, what's your status?
CARTER
Pallan's trying to access the link right now. If he can get in, we
might be able to reprogram it.
O'NEILL
Understood. We're comin' to you.
[O'Neill and Teal'c are no longer wearing the hazmats. They are walking
in the garden area.]
[Pallan comes around to the console Carter is sitting at and presses
keys. The screens go black and the streaming code appears again.]
PALLAN
What did I do?
CARTER
It's another update.
[Out in the town square, the citizens stop moving and stare off into
space again. Kendrick and Nevin are in their house doing the same.
Seconds later, they continue on.]
KENDRICK
Nevin, I want you to stay here.
NEVIN
Father? Is Colonel O'Neill sick?
KENDRICK
He is, but we're going to make him better.
[He leaves.]
EXT--TOWN SQUARE
[O'Neill and Teal'c arrive in the square the find the place deserted
and quiet. They look around, seeming a little unnerved.]
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Pallan places his fingers on the keyboard, pauses, then sighs and
takes his fingers off again.]
CARTER
What is it?
PALLAN
These systems are so complicated. Without access to the link, I'm
not sure I know what I'm doing.
CARTER
Pallan, you've been doing this you're whole life. You're just going
to have to try to remember the old-fashioned way.
PALLAN
Right.
[He moves to another console and closes an open panel door on the way
there. He sits down and begins typing again. ]
EXT--TOWN SQUARE
[Meanwhile O'Neill and Teal'c are exploring the town, weapons ready.
They turn a corner and see a lot of citizens coming toward them. They
turn back.
O'NEILL
Maybe not that way.
TEAL'C
Agreed.
[They backtrack, turn another corner and see more people coming.
Kendrick is leading this group. They decide to continue straight rather
than turn.]
O'NEILL
Let's keep moving.
(Then into his radio)
Uh, Carter, we may have a little problem here.
CARTER
They're being controlled by the computer, Sir.
[Teal'c and O'Neill pick up the pace, but they are still being pursued
by the two groups of people. They turn another corner and see their
advance blocked by another group. O'Neill points down the same entrance
Evalla had gone into when she disappeared through the barrier. O'Neill
raises his weapon as Teal'c explores the entrance. He taps the same
wall Daniel had and discovers the barrier.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(Quietly to Teal'c)
Hey, come here.
[He aims his weapon at Kendrick. Teal'c rejoins him at the mouth of the
entrance, pointing his weapon in the opposite direction from O'Neill.]
KENDRICK
Everything's going to be all right, Colonel.
[He extends his hand and reveals two link devices.]
KENDRICK
These are for you.
O'NEILL
I don't think so.
KENDRICK
You've been disconnected from the link. You're not well. Let us help
you.
O'NEILL
(Into his radio, but keeping his weapon raised and finger on the
trigger)
Carter, now would be a good time.
INT--DOME CONTROL ROOM
[Pallan is typing away and then stops.]
PALLAN
I'm in. Now, what do I tell them?
CARTER
There's no time to explain everything. Try to erase all memory of us
completely.
[Pallan nods and starts typing.]
EXT--TOWN
[The townspeople begin to slowly advance on Teal'c and O'Neill. O'Neill
is still staring down the sight of his P--90, which is aimed at
Kendrick. Teal'c raises his staff weapon.]
O'NEILL
Don't make me shoot you.
KENDRICK
You're not yourself, Colonel. Without the link, your mind is playing
tricks on you.
[In the control room, Pallan moves to another console and types on it.
He steps back and watches and the screens go black and the streaming
code appears again.]
[In the town, the people stop and stare into space, as if in a trance.
O'Neill and Teal'c lower their weapons slightly. Seconds later, the
townspeople wake up and look around at each other, a bit dazed.]
KENDRICK
(To O'Neill)
Who are you?
[In the control room, Pallan is stunned.]
PALLAN
I did it.
[Carter smiles up at him.]
EXT--GARDEN
[Several townspeople are dressed in hazmats walking in the garden area.
They are meeting SG personnel at the barrier. The SG people are not in
hazmat gear. Carter and Pallan--also not in hazmat suits--are following
a group of people. They watch as some townspeople walk through the
barrier and disappear.]
CARTER
We ran some tests on the geo-thermal vents that supply the town's
power. Looks like they started to cool about two hundred years ago.
The dome started shrinking some time after that. We should have the
whole town relocated in a couple of days.
PALLAN
I think I'm going to miss this garden. How much longer will the
force field last?
CARTER
It's difficult to say. I mean even with less and less surface area
to maintain, the power would have failed eventually.
PALLAN
And in the meantime, more of us would have disappeared.
CARTER
You still don't remember her, do you?
PALLAN
No. You know, in a way, I envy the others. They all, they all must
have lost somebody, but I'm the only one who knows for sure. And how
do you mourn someone when you can't even picture her face?
CARTER
I'm sorry, Pallan. I wish I could help.
PALLAN
Maybe you can.
[He laughs.]
CARTER
How?
PALLAN
Tell me about her.
[Carter nods.]
