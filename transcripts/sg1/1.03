TITLE
The Enemy Within
TEASER
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill, Kawalsky, Daniel and Carter are standing in front of
a map of planets.]
HAMMOND
Gentlemen, these planets designated P3-575 and P3A-577 have been
submitted by Captain Carter's team as possible destinations for your
next mission. SG units one and two will operate concurrently.
[O'Neill turns to Kawalsky.]
O'NEILL
You know, I'm kind of partial to P3-575 if you don't mind taking
P3A-577.
KAWALSKY
No I'll take 577.
O'NEILL
I'm not married to it.
KAWALSKY
No, no it's...
O'NEILL
I want to be fair about it. How about we flip for it?
HAMMOND
How about you go where I tell you. As far as I'm concerned...
[Alarms go off as the Stargate starts to activate.]
DAVIS
Alert! Inbound traveler! Repeat. Inbound traveler!
KAWALSKY
Damn, those Goa'ulds are persistent.
O'NEILL
I think we pissed them off.
DAVIS
Closing the iris.
[Soldiers run to stand before the Stargate, weapons ready. The computer
screen flashes "Warning. Unrecognized traveler."]
HAMMOND
Alert! All defense teams stand by.
(turns to Davis)
Set the base auto destruct countdown at three minutes.
[Davis does so. The seventh chevron locks. There is the sound of a
wormhole engaging, but the iris remains in place. There are several
thuds. Carter flinches.]
KAWALSKY
We're not going anywhere as long as the Goa'ulds keep up these
attacks.
DANIEL
They can't keep them up forever...Can they?
[More thuds are heard, impacting against the iris.]
O'NEILL
Whoa.
CARTER
Well, once they realize our Gate's impenetrable they should just
give up.
KAWALSKY
Part of me just wants to let 'em through. Give 'em the fight they're
looking for.
[There's one last thud, and the Stargate shuts down.]
DAVIS
Radiation team, move in.
[Two technicians scan the iris with radiation-detecting equipment.]
O'NEILL
Well, there've got to be worse ways to go, I suppose.
DANIEL
You don't think the Goa'ulds are sending people through, do you?
O'NEILL
Be like bugs on a windshield.
DAVIS
Team reports all clear, sir.
HAMMOND
All right, stand down from alert and abort the countdown.
[The soldiers relax. Kawalsky rubs the back of his neck and groans.
O'Neill notices.]
O'NEILL
Kawalsky. What's the matter?
KAWALSKY
Headache. Took a fistful of aspirin but nothing helps.
O'NEILL
Get down to the infirmary. Get it checked out. Go on.
KAWALSKY
Yes, sir, I think I'll do that.
(Turns to Hammond)
Sir, with your permission?
[Kawalsky salutes Hammond, Hammond salutes back.]
HAMMOND
By all means, Major. I need you to lead your team to P3-575.
[Kawalsky leaves, deliberately brushing against O'Neill as he passes.
O'Neill smirks. The Stargate starts to turn again.]
DAVIS
Inbound traveler! Inbound traveler!
HAMMOND
Reset the countdown. Here we go again. All defense teams remain in
position.
[Once again, the soldiers get ready as the Stargate activates.]
DANIEL
(to Carter)
So this iris is going to hold right?
CARTER
Pure titanium. Less than three micrometers from the event horizon.
It won't even allow matter to fully reintegrate.
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
So this iris is going to hold, right?
CARTER
If it doesn't, the failsafe device will detonate, this whole
mountain will vaporize, and there'll be nothing to worry about.
O'NEILL
Ah. Good, I feel much better.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
Come.
[O'Neill walks in.]
HAMMOND
I can understand how Kawalsky feels. This job gives me a headache
too.
O'NEILL
Uh-huh. What's the bad news, General?
HAMMOND
Not much for small talk are you, Colonel?
O'NEILL
How was your weekend? Get any fishing in?
HAMMOND
I'm rejecting your request to have Teal'c join SG-1. Wasn't my
choice. A Colonel Kennedy is en route from the Pentagon right now.
He'll be asking your friend some questions.
O'NEILL
What kind of questions?
HAMMOND
What we're up against. Troop strength, technology, weaponry.
O'NEILL
I'd like to know the answers to those questions too, sir. But after
they're done asking them...
HAMMOND
There'll be more questions. Possible tests. After all he's carrying
the larval form of a hostile and very formidable enemy, inside his
body.
O'NEILL
(suspiciously)
What kind of tests are we talking about?
HAMMOND
Maybe you haven't noticed, Colonel. But he's the first alien species
we've actually run into. You don't think that qualifies your friend
as a subject of scientific interest?
O'NEILL
A subject?
HAMMOND
He is what he is, Colonel.
O'NEILL
With all due respect, sir, I don't think he saved the lives of my
team or came over to our side so he could become a damn guinea pig
for U.S. military intelligence.
HAMMOND
Back up, Colonel. He switched sides once. Are you 100% positive he
won't switch back?
O'NEILL
(firmly)
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
Well you are alone in that assertion. Colonel Kennedy arrives within
the hour. I promise Teal'c will be treated with dignity and respect
for as long as he remains a guest of this facility. Beyond that, I
can't promise a damn thing. Dismissed, Colonel.
[O'Neill looks unhappy, but he turns and leaves.]
INT--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
[O'Neill enters. Teal'c is meditating.]
O'NEILL
Hey. Am I interrupting anything?
TEAL'C
Yes.
O'NEILL
Why don't I come back?
TEAL'C
The people from Chulak?
O'NEILL
We sent the last of them back through the Gate just before the
Goa'uld started knocking at the door.
TEAL'C
Good.
O'NEILL
(nods)
Thanks to you. So how long do you think they'll keep it up?
TEAL'C
One, perhaps two more attempts. They will believe their weapons have
destroyed you. They will not send warriors through for some time to
make sure of your destruction.
O'NEILL
Well, they'll be in for a surprise, huh?
TEAL'C
Your iris will be closed. They will be crushed.
O'NEILL
(shrugs)
Surprise.
TEAL'C
Am I a prisoner?
O'NEILL
Ahh, yeah.
TEAL'C
I understand.
O'NEILL
We're not exactly living up to your expectations of us, are we?
[O'Neill pulls out a chair and sits as he's talking.]
O'NEILL
You see, Teal'c, we've been living alone in our little corner of the
galaxy for quite a while and I think...the people I work for just
need to get to know you a little better. I mean, your knowledge of
the Goa'ulds alone makes them a little curious.
TEAL'C
I will give that knowledge freely.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I know you will, and we'll put it to good use.
TEAL'C
I will pledge my allegiance to this world.
O'NEILL
I'm just not sure that's ever going to be enough for them to trust
you. To be honest with you, I think they're scared of you.
TEAL'C
(looks away)
I understand.
O'NEILL
(studying Teal'c)
You must be used to that by now, huh?
TEAL'C
I am a Jaffa. I have served as a warrior for your enemy. I have
carried your enemy within me.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Well, it's kind of a human thing. We tend to be afraid of
things we don't know.
TEAL'C
Why is O'Neill not afraid?
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I saw you stand up to a god. You refused to kill. I saw you
make that decision.
TEAL'C
Yes.
O'NEILL
In that moment, I learned everything I needed to know to trust you.
TEAL'C
If I had killed you then, I would not be here now.
O'NEILL
(stands)
Neither would I.
TEAL'C
I will prove my allegiance, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I sure wish you didn't have to.
TEAL'C
When I do...you will show me this world?
O'NEILL
Oh, you bet.
(claps Teal'c on the shoulder)
Just not all at once, though.
(knocks on door.)
It's big.
[A guard opens the door. O'Neill leaves. Teal'c looks reflective for a
moment, then goes back to meditating.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Doctor Nimzicki is shining a light into Kawalsky's eye.]
NIMZICKI
And these headaches, Major...they started when you came back from
your last mission?
KAWALSKY
Yeah. And they've been getting worse.
NIMZICKI
Anybody else on the team experience these symptoms?
KAWALSKY
No. Why?
NIMZICKI
It could be a reaction to Gate travel.
KAWALSKY
Look, Doc, just give me a horse pill for the pain, or something.
It's a damn headache.
[Doctor Nimzicki touches a lump at the back of Kawalsky's neck. He
looks worried as he examines it.]
NIMZICKI
What's this? You didn't notice this?
KAWALSKY
What? Notice what?
[The lump suddenly moves and moves up Kawalsky's spine and into his
brain. It's a goa'uld.]
KAWALSKY
Ahh...ahh...arrghhhh!
[Kawalsky's eyes glow and he grabs Doctor Nimzicki by the throat.]
NIMZICKI
Major!
[Kawalsky twists his wrist and snaps the doctor's neck.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter and Daniel are leading a briefing about the DHD.]
DANIEL
So the device should be on every planet we find. I studied the one
on Abydos for months. It's sort of like a...a...a...
CARTER
Telephone.
DANIEL
Telephone.
(smiles at Carter)
I like that. In order to get back home all you have to do is...dial
Earth. Which is uh...
[Daniel is distracted by something.]
DANIEL
Which is what we're here to talk about, so...
[As he's talking, he walks to the observation window overlooking the
Gate Room.]
DANIEL
What is Major Kawalsky doing in the Embarkation Room?
[Carter moves beside Daniel; both look down out of the window and see
Kawalsky standing on the ramp with his arms outstretched.]
CARTER
Page Colonel O'Neill and General Hammond to the Embarkation Room,
now!
SOLDIER
Yes, Ma'am!
[Daniel and Carter leave to go to the Gate room.]
INT--SGC GATEROOM
[Kawalsky is standing on the ramp. O'Neill and Hammond enter the room.
Daniel and Carter are already standing behind Kawalsky.]
O'NEILL
Charlie?
DANIEL
Major Kawalsky?
KAWALSKY
(looks around, confused)
Jack?
[O'Neill walks up to him.]
KAWALSKY
What am I doing here?
[Kawalsky and O'Neill stare at each other.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Kawalsky is sitting on a bed while O'Neill goes to find a doctor.]
O'NEILL
Hey, we got a sick man here!
(to himself)
Where the hell is he?
(to Kawalsky)
Was the doctor here before?
KAWALSKY
I don't remember.
[Doctor Warner enters.]
WARNER
Sorry, Dr. Nimzicki was supposed to be on call.
[He holds out a hand. Kawalsky shakes it.]
WARNER
Dr. Warner, Chief Surgeon. What's the problem?
KAWALSKY
Headache.
O'NEILL
Little more than a headache, Doc. He just had a blackout.
WARNER
Hmm. We'll do an MRI right away. See what's going on in there.
[Warner and O'Neill walk out.]
O'NEILL
Take care of him, Doc. We need him.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond, Kennedy and a female officer leave the office and enter the
Briefing Room.]
KENNEDY
Thank you.
[Teal'c enters, escorted by two guards.]
HAMMOND
Welcome, Teal'c. This is Colonel Kennedy.
KENNEDY
I'm extraordinarily pleased to meet you, sir.
HAMMOND
Colonel Kennedy's job is to gather information...uh, knowledge,
about our potential enemies.
TEAL'C
I offer my knowledge of the Goa'ulds. I offer my skills as a warrior
in defeating them. I pledge my honor and my life to this world.
KENNEDY
Well, thank you.
HAMMOND
This is just an informal meeting, son. Take a seat.
[Teal'c sits. The soldiers flanking him remain on guard.]
KENNEDY
I have a lot of questions to ask, so if there are no objections.
What can you tell us about the power source the Goa'ulds use to
power their weapons? Ships?
TEAL'C
Nothing.
KENNEDY
I see. Do you, yourself, have an understanding of the physics behind
the Stargate?
TEAL'C
No.
KENNEDY
I see.
TEAL'C
Knowledge of Goa'uld magic is forbidden.
[O'Neill walks up the stairs.]
O'NEILL
It's not magic, Teal'c. They just want you to think that. Permission
to barge in, sir?
KENNEDY
Colonel O'Neill. I was hoping to meet you. Your mission report from
Chulak made for the most engrossing analysis of my career.
O'NEILL
Well, thanks. What was your favorite part?
HAMMOND
(frowning)
Perhaps now is not the time, Colonel?
O'NEILL
General, you know what I went and did? I told Teal'c how we all
respect a person's rights in this country.
KENNEDY
I assure you, there is nothing untoward taking place here, Colonel.
Please, join us.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
(waves)
Hey, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
That's Teal'c with an apostrophe. T--E--A--L--apostrophe--C.
HAMMOND
Colonel.
(sighs)
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
KENNEDY
Very well, Teal'c. What can you tell me about the Goa'ulds?
TEAL'C
They rule by force. Their numbers were very few, but they are
growing.
KENNEDY
How many worlds do they control?
TEAL'C
Many hundreds. Perhaps more.
KENNEDY
And should we expect to encounter these Goa'ulds everywhere we go?
O'NEILL
(whispers to Hammond)
We?
TEAL'C
It is possible. But there are many more worlds the Goa'ulds have no
use for. On those worlds the people are abandoned and left to fend
for themselves.
KENNEDY
Is there a leadership or government with which we could negotiate a
peace?
TEAL'C
Some, like Apophis, are great kings and rule over many worlds as
their gods. But they have no need for peace. If they could kill you,
they would.
KENNEDY
Could they? They have space craft, right?
TEAL'C
Yes. Without a Stargate, such a journey would take many months;
perhaps even years. It would take many vessels; many slave armies.
O'NEILL
We're not that much of a nuisance, just yet.
KENNEDY
These slaves, where do they come from?
TEAL'C
There is a tale of a primitive world the Goa'uld discovered
millennia ago. The Tau'ri. First World where forms of this type
evolved. It is said the Goa'uld harvested among the primitives, some
became Goa'uld hosts, others became Jaffa; the rest were taken as
slaves and seeded among the stars to serve them. But that world has
been lost for centuries.
KENNEDY
Teal'c, beings of this form evolved here, on Earth.
TEAL'C
(looks around surprised)
This world?
O'NEILL
Is the world you're talking about Teal'c. Ra came here. If our
ancestors hadn't rebelled and buried the Stargate...
TEAL'C
You would have not become strong enough to challenge them.
KENNEDY
Then the galaxy is populated by the ancient people of Earth?
HAMMOND
There could be millions by now.
TEAL'C
Then you are their greatest hope. And mine.
[O'Neill looks reflective.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Kawalsky enters the MRI chamber. In the Observation Room, Doctor
Warner is typing on a computer.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Daniel and Carter come out of an elevator.]
CARTER
I'm going to drop by the Control Room. By the silence around here,
it seems like the Goa'ulds have finally given up.
[Daniel rubs his eyes. Carter looks at him.]
CARTER
When was the last time you slept?
DANIEL
I don't know.
CARTER
Doesn't help when the whole base goes on alert every two hours.
DANIEL
No, it's not that, it's just that...my mind races and I can't stop
thinking about Sha're, where she is, what she's become...
CARTER
I know. But you can't stay awake forever.
DANIEL
I can try.
[He lifts a cup of coffee and forces a laugh. Off Carter's look.]
DANIEL
No, you're right, I'll meet you at the next briefing.
[Carter slaps him on the back and leaves.]
INT--BUNK ROOM
[Daniel enters one of the bunkrooms. The room is dark. He puts his
coffee down and sits on the bottom bunk. An arm falls from the top
bunk; blood is dripping off the fingers. Daniel switches on the light
and finds Doctor Nimzicki, dead on the upper bunk.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Doctor Warner is looking at the MRI and sees a snake-like creature
wrapped around Kawalsky's brain stem and spine. He frowns.]
WARNER
All right.
[Warner walks over to Kawalsky.]
WARNER
Major Kawalsky? We're all done here, but I'm taking you off active
duty as of now.
[Kawalsky sits up, but doesn't say anything.]
WARNER
Major?
[Kawalsky turns to Warner, his eyes glowing. Warner stumbles backward
and hits the alarm. A warning horn sounds.]
LOUDSPEAKER
Security to the Infirmary. Security to the Infirmary. Set--condition
Red. Set--condition red.
[Kawalsky walks out through the corridors, past the guards rushing
toward the Infirmary. He enters the control room, punching and knocking
down three technicians. At the computer, he starts punching in the
commands to dial the Stargate.]
CARTER
(walking in)
Kawalsky, what the hell are you doing?
[Kawalsky pushes her across the room. Carter falls, but gets up and
heads for the microphone.]
CARTER
Close the blast doors.
(over the loudspeaker)
Emergency in the Control Room! Emergency in the Control Room!
[Kawalsky grabs her and pulls her away, one hand over her mouth. Carter
fights him.]
KAWALSKY
(in a Goa'uld voice)
Help me!
[Carter's eyes open wide in fear.]
O'NEILL
Kawalsky!
[Kawalsky whirls around to O'Neill. He backs away holding Carter.
O'Neill follows them as several airmen rush to the scene.]
O'NEILL
(shouts)
Don't shoot!
[He moves after the pair, pushing an airman's gun barrel down.]
O'NEILL
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
[Kawalsky pulls Carter into an elevator and pushes one of the buttons.
O'Neill gets there just as the doors close. He runs for the stairs.]
INT--SGC ELEVATOR
[Kawalsky pushes Carter away from him.]
CARTER
You know they won't let you out of this mountain alive. When those
doors open, they'll shoot on sight; you know that!
[Carter eyes the phone and tries to grab it. Kawalsky grabs her and
throws her backward. She hits the wall hard, then slides down into a
heap. Kawalsky stares at the elevator doors, expressionless.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ELEVATOR
HAMMOND
What the...?
DANIEL
Someone inside the elevator hit the emergency stop.
HAMMOND
Get those doors open!
[O'Neill arrives.]
O'NEILL
Get 'em open.
KAWALSKY
(in a normal voice)
Well, it's about time. Gimme a hand here.
O'NEILL
Charlie, what the hell's going on?
KAWALSKY
I don't have a clue, Colonel, but she's hurt bad. We have to get her
to the infirmary.
[O'Neill stares at him.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Warner shows Kawalsky's MRI results on the computer. He points to the
image.]
WARNER
The parasite's wrapped around his spine.
[O'Neill and Hammond share a worried look. Kawalsky is strapped to a
rotating platform on a huge wheel. The platform rotates ninety degrees,
so that Kawalsky moves from a flat position to a standing one. O'Neill
and Daniel cross from opposite sides of the room to stand in front of
him. Only Kawalsky's face shows through the platform.]
O'NEILL
It's a...It's a Goa'uld. Probably an infant.
DANIEL
They think that the reason it hasn't been able to take you over
completely is it's not mature yet.
O'NEILL
It's what's causing your blackouts.
KAWALSKY
What are you saying? I got one of those parasites in me? Well, how
in the hell does that happen?
O'NEILL
We were kinda hoping you could tell us. You didn't feel it
happening?
KAWALSKY
(scoffs)
No.
DANIEL
When was the first time you blacked out?
KAWALSKY
I was here. We'd just come back through from Chulak. I thought it
was just from coming back through the Stargate. We were helping that
kid, Casey was his name. It was a sharp...Oh, God, Jack. I thought I
wrenched my neck.
[O'Neill winces and looks down.]
KAWALSKY
Well, anyway, Casey, he was all right, they took him out of there.
[He looks at O'Neill, tears in his eyes.]
KAWALSKY
Oh, God, Jack, you got to help me. You got to get this thing out of
me.
O'NEILL
(somberly)
That's the plan.
WARNER
(to Hammond)
I've taken Major Kawalsky off all pain medication to increase his
alertness. This should increase his ability to resist.
[On the other side of the room, Hammond and Doctor Warner confer.]
HAMMOND
When can you remove it?
WARNER
It would be an extremely complex operation. The parasite has
literally woven itself around his nervous system.
HAMMOND
(brusquely)
Can it be done or not?
WARNER
Without killing him, possibly. Without making him a quadriplegic,
that's a whole different story.
HAMMOND
You just tell me who you need to assist. Anyone in the world. I'll
have them here within 24 hours.
WARNER
Yes, sir.
KAWALSKY
When I was out, did I hurt anybody?
O'NEILL
There's one man dead. A few more hurt.
KAWALSKY
(closes eyes)
Oh...God...
DANIEL
Captain Carter's going to be all right. I was just going to go check
on her, actually.
KAWALSKY
Oh, I didn't mean to...
DANIEL
(hastily)
No, she doesn't blame you.
O'NEILL
You're not responsible Charlie. It's not your fault. It's that damn
thing that's inside you. Look, as soon as they know how to do it,
they'll cut it out of you. Right now, you got to fight it.
KAWALSKY
I don't mind telling you; this is scaring me big time.
[O'Neill looks worried.]
INT--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
[Kennedy, Hammond and O'Neill walk in.]
KENNEDY
Teal'c, stand and face this way, please.
TEAL'C
(standing)
What is the emergency? They would not tell me.
KENNEDY
That's none of your concern now.
O'NEILL
(glares at Kennedy)
Kawalsky's become infected with a Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
And you wish to see if I still carry the Goa'uld within me?
KENNEDY
Yes. Now, please.
[Teal'c unzips his flight suit. The larva pokes out of his pouch.]
O'NEILL
God, I hate those things. You've seen enough?
[The larva goes back in.]
KENNEDY
You understand we had to look and see?
TEAL'C
What are its demands?
O'NEILL
So far it's only managed to rear its butt-ugly head whenever
Kawalsky blacks out. But it's already killed a man.
TEAL'C
Then there will be a struggle for the host body. It must have sought
a host in desperation before it was mature.
HAMMOND
We intend to remove it before that happens.
TEAL'C
It will kill the host if you try. Once it is one with the host, it
is capable of killing him.
O'NEILL
So...what do we do?
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Kawalsky is struggling on the bed. Hammond, Teal'c and O'Neill walk
in.]
O'NEILL
Charlie, we got General Hammond for you.
KAWALSKY
(painfully)
General, please. You got to tell them to do something. The pain is
too much.
HAMMOND
We are, Major. You just have to hold on.
KAWALSKY
(getting pissed)
No. Don't you give me that good soldier crap, General. You order
them to cut this damn thing out of me!
O'NEILL
Teal'c says if they do that, you might die.
KAWALSKY
I don't care!
O'NEILL
Look, Charlie. They want to talk to it.
KAWALSKY
What? What the hell is there to talk about?!
TEAL'C
We must offer it life to save yours.
KAWALSKY
No. No! I want you to kill it!
TEAL'C
We must talk to the Goa'uld within you.
KAWALSKY
Jack, please help me, Jack!
O'NEILL
Charlie, just let them do their job, will ya?
KAWALSKY
No! Don't let them do this, Jack! I want you to kill it! Kill it,
Jack, kill it.
[The monitors start to speed up.]
WARNER
His heart rate just doubled.
KAWALSKY
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!
[Kawalsky suddenly collapses. The monitors increase in tempo. There's a
beep, then everything evens out on the monitors. Kawalsky rears up, but
it's not him talking.]
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Nemes Kree! I won't speak to the traitor. You are their leader?
HAMMOND
I am.
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Speak.
HAMMOND
I'm General George Hammond of the United States Air Force.
Commander-in-Chief of the SGC. And you are?
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Interested only in returning through the Stargate. Now!
HAMMOND
You are in no position to make demands. I have a proposition.
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Release me now or I will destroy you!
HAMMOND
If you leave this man's body, we will allow you to live and send you
back through the Stargate in your natural form.
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
This body is mine!
HAMMOND
If you're unwilling to leave, we will be forced to surgically...
[Kawalsky pulls back, and rips his arm out of the restraint. He starts
trying to get off the bed. Teal'c, O'Neill, and Doctor Warner grab
him.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c! Hold him!
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Release me now, or I will destroy you!
HAMMOND
Do not attempt to escape!
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
I command you!
HAMMOND
We will open fire! Colonel, stand aside!
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Release me now!
HAMMOND
Take aim!
[Kawalsky looks up.]
KAWALSKY
(normal voice)
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
O'NEILL
Don't shoot!
HAMMOND
Hold your fire!
KAWALSKY
Oh, oh, God!
HAMMOND
It's all right, son. I won't put you through that again.
KAWALSKY
(crying)
Oh, Jack, what did I do?
O'NEILL
Uh, nothing, you just got a little mouthy. Nothing serious.
HAMMOND
Dr. Warner? I want to know the minute that godforsaken thing can be
taken out of my officer. Is that clear?
WARNER
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
This conversation is over.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c, Daniel, Warner and Kennedy are already
seated. Hammond walks in and they rise.]
HAMMOND
As you were people. In light of the day's events, Colonel Kennedy
has chosen to make certain recommendations to my superiors that I
want to share with all of you. Colonel Kennedy?
KENNEDY
I know that many of you have served with Major Kawalsky, so please
forgive me if what I am about to suggest appears in any
way...callous. But I believe surgical removal of the parasite may be
a mistake.
O'NEILL
General, this is a waste of time Kawalsky does not have.
KENNEDY
Dr. Warner, what are Major Kawalsky's chances of surviving the
procedure?
WARNER
Ten...twelve percent at most.
KENNEDY
And the parasite? It is an intelligent being after all, isn't it,
Colonel? I believe I first read that in your report.
WARNER
The parasite itself would not survive the procedure.
KENNEDY
So, we're faced with destroying one life in the hopeless attempt to
save another. You see the ethical dilemma?
O'NEILL
No, I don't.
WARNER
My team and I are completely prepared to perform the procedure, sir.
We'll do our best.
KENNEDY
Of course you will, Doctor. Please don't misunderstand. We all wish
the invading parasite in Major Kawalsky's body could be safely
removed. But the facts are the facts.
CARTER
I'm sorry, what was your point?
KENNEDY
If we proceed with this operation, Major Kawalsky will have died in
vain.
CARTER
And if we don't?
KENNEDY
Well let's consider that for a moment. These infant Goa'ulds; if
they're so young, so fragile in their larval state that they require
a, uh...a, uh...I'm sorry what was it you called yourself?
TEAL'C
Jaffa.
KENNEDY
For want of a better translation; what? Incubator? How is it that
they're so intelligent?
TEAL'C
A Goa'uld is born with all the knowledge of all Goa'ulds that came
before it.
DANIEL
Genetic memory. That's amazing.
KENNEDY
Yes, it is. All the knowledge of the Goa'ulds. I just want you all
to think on that before we just throw it away.
O'NEILL
I've thought about it.
(to Carter, who nods)
You thought about it? I think we've all thought about it. Yeah.
(looks around the table)
Any more thinking to be done?
HAMMOND
Colonel.
KENNEDY
Imagine if we could convince this Goa'uld to share that knowledge.
TEAL'C
A Goa'uld would not willingly share.
DANIEL
Teal'c is right. To them, we're nothing. Less than nothing, I
mean...think about it; they've taken on the roles of our ancient
gods. What does that tell you?
KENNEDY
All right. What if we just studied it? How much could we learn from
that? What if we just faced up to the fact of Major Kawalsky's slim
chances of survival and realize that the greatest enemy mankind may
ever face has just been delivered right to our doorstep? Even if we
let it return through the Stargate as a gesture of good faith, how
much could we...?
HAMMOND
(interrupting, enraged)
Just what kind of an officer are you, Colonel?
KENNEDY
Sir...?
HAMMOND
As long as there is a snowball's chance in hell that my officer will
come out of this procedure alive, we'll go ahead with it.
KENNEDY
With respect, General, I feel I should take this to my superiors.
HAMMOND
(snorts)
Well, me, I'll probably just call the President and get approval
right from the horse's mouth. But sure, you go right ahead, Colonel.
Talk to your superiors. In the meantime, people, let's get the job
done.
[Hammond leaves the room. Only O'Neill, Carter and Warner rise.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c's larva has been partially pulled from his pouch, and is being
held in place for study.]
WARNER
Do you have any sense that the new anaesthetic is working better
than the last one we tried?
TEAL'C
Yes.
WARNER
But you're not sure? There's no communication at all between you and
the symbiote?
TEAL'C
A Jaffa does not communicate with the Goa'uld it carries.
WARNER
Well, keep your fingers crossed. Nurse, you can stop this IV and
release the patient. We'll go with this one.
[Kawalsky is strapped to a regular bed on the other side of the room;
O'Neill sitting in a chair beside him.]
O'NEILL
They're getting ready.
KAWALSKY
It's about time.
O'NEILL
How's the pain?
KAWALSKY
Maybe I'm just getting used to it. Listen, Jack, if this doesn't
work...
O'NEILL
Hey, come on. It's...it's a cakewalk.
KAWALSKY
It hurts to talk; will you shut up for a second? I wanna be
cremated. I don't want there to be anything left of that thing
inside me. You make sure, all right?
O'NEILL
Look, can we not talk about this?
KAWALSKY
When am I going to talk about it, Jack? This could be my last
conversation.
O'NEILL
Aw, for crying out loud. It's not your last conversation.
KAWALSKY
Hey, I spoke to the doc; he told me the odds. Don't give me any
crap.
O'NEILL
Okay. It's our last conversation.
KAWALSKY
You're going to be off on some other planet anyway.
O'NEILL
Yeah, P3A-575.
KAWALSKY
Whatever. This was going to be my first real command. I was looking
forward to it.
O'NEILL
You still can, Charlie.
KAWALSKY
They got me all tied up here. Give me your hand.
[O'Neill gives Kawalsky his hand; Kawalsky holds it.]
KAWALSKY
I want you to know; no matter what happens...it was an honor to
serve with you, sir.
O'NEILL
Listen, I got to ask you something. It's not easy for me.
KAWALSKY
We're friends.
O'NEILL
(seriously)
If you don't make it...can I have your stereo?
[Kawalsky laughs and starts coughing.]
O'NEILL
What?
KAWALSKY
(coughing)
It hurts to laugh.
O'NEILL
(pats their joined hands)
You all right?
KAWALSKY
Ahh...Never better.
INT--SGC OPERATING ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are watching from the
Observation Room above.]
WARNER
I've held back on the use of anaesthetic until it can be
administered to both patient and creature simultaneously. Major
Kawalsky, we're going to begin the operation. Are you ready?
KAWALSKY
I wanna say something. General Hammond, sir?
HAMMOND
(over speaker)
I'm here, son.
KAWALSKY
If this doesn't work...I want you to give the order. I want to wake
up as me or not at all.
[O'Neill looks down at his clasped hands.]
HAMMOND
(after hesitation)
You have my word, son.
NURSE
Scalpel.
[Warner nods at the anesthesiologist.]
ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
Injecting anaesthetic.
WARNER
All right. Start the clock.
[A nurse reaches over and starts the clock at zero.]
[00:00:02]
WARNER
I'm making the first incision.
[01:19:51]
WARNER
I'm separating the primary ganglia attaching the parasite to the
spinal cord...now. It's coming away more easily than I'd hoped. Must
be the anaesthetic.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
CARTER
At least it's going well.
DANIEL
That's fantastic. If we can reverse what's happened to the major,
then there's still a chance for Sha're.
CARTER
(looks at Daniel sympathetically)
Let's hope.
INT--SGC OPERATING ROOM
WARNER
The ganglia are still constricting...periodically. Obviously there
still seems to be some sign of life in this symbiote. I don't know
how. Scissors.
NURSE
Scissors.
WARNER
There are thin filaments extending up and into the brain. I'm going
to sever them.
[Warner cuts the filaments. Kawalsky starts to seize.]
WARNER
Hold him still!
HAMMOND
What's happening?
[Kawalsky falls still.]
WARNER
I don't know, sir, I don't think it was anything I did. I'd like to
proceed.
HAMMOND
How much longer?
WARNER
Almost there. Almost. Large clamp?
NURSE
Large clamp.
[The monitor shows the goa'uld being cut in half and the bottom half
being pulled from Kawalsky.]
WARNER
I'm taking it out...now.
[He puts the goa'uld in a basin.]
WARNER
I think we did it. Close for me.
HAMMOND
Well done, everyone.
[O'Neill looks down at the dead goa'uld, then at Teal'c, who remains
impassive.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Kawalsky is waking up.]
O'NEILL
(leaning over Kawalsky)
That's right, Dorothy. It was all a dream.
WARNER
Can you move your fingers?
[Kawalsky waves.]
WARNER
Toes?
[O'Neill and Warner look down at Kawalsky's feet and grin.]
O'NEILL
Hey.
WARNER
Congratulations, Major. You've already exceeded my wildest
expectations.
[Warner leaves.]
KAWALSKY
Thirsty.
[O'Neill gets him a drink.]
O'NEILL
Here.
[Kawalsky drinks, then coughs.]
O'NEILL
Easy, big fella. You're not drinking for two any more.
KAWALSKY
I made it.
O'NEILL
See? I told you. Piece of cake.
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Kennedy enters. He salutes Hammond.]
KENNEDY
I heard the operation was a complete success, sir. Congratulations.
And I have my orders to return to Langley.
HAMMOND
Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.
KENNEDY
With Teal'c, sir, I have his travel orders as well.
HAMMOND
You do realize without his cooperation in finding an anaesthetic,
the operation might have been a failure? I think we owe him
something for that.
KENNEDY
Unfortunately, Teal'c is now carrying the only living Goa'uld
available for study; and we do need to study it, sir, make no
mistake on that. These aliens are possibly the greatest threat this
country has ever known.
HAMMOND
I'm well aware of the threat, Colonel. This facility is the front
line. It's the reason this command exists. We just go about things
differently around here.
KENNEDY
I see. Well, I'll make the transport arrangements in the morning.
HAMMOND
You do that.
[He salutes Kennedy. Kennedy returns the salute, then leaves.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[O'Neill and Daniel are visiting Kawalsky, who's still in bed.]
DANIEL
Anyway. Uh...Colonel Kennedy's probably going to want to take it
with him. So, if you wanna see it once before..?
KAWALSKY
Are you talking about that thing in my head?
O'NEILL
Daniel thinks it's fascinating.
DANIEL
No! I just thought you might wanna see it.
KAWALSKY
Nooo, thanks.
[Carter enters.]
CARTER
Hey, I just heard. They're shipping Teal'c out to Langley. Kennedy's
taking him with him.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
What for?
CARTER
"Study." That's Kennedy's word.
O'NEILL
Right.
(angrily)
Like a damn lab rat. Apparently Kennedy's ethics are selective.
[O'Neill stalks out, Daniel following him. Carter moves to stand beside
Kawalsky.]
KAWALSKY
Listen, in case the Colonel can't talk them out of it; I'd like a
minute alone with Teal'c before they ship him out. He helped get me
through this. I got to thank him.
[He grabs Carter's hand.]
CARTER
Okay, I think that can be arranged.
[Carter leaves.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is brought down to see Kawalsky, escorted by two guards.]
KAWALSKY
Hey, come on over here. I wanna shake hands with the man who helped
save my life.
[Teal'c looks at the guards, then moves to shake hands with Kawalsky.]
KAWALSKY
(to guards)
I'd like a minute alone with my friend.
[Teal'c smiles slightly and looks backward. The guards hesitate.]
KAWALSKY
I'll make it an order, does that make you feel better?
[The guards exchange a shrug, then leave. Kawalsky looks away and then
whips back. His eyes glow as he grabs Teal'c by the throat.]
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Jaffa! What they removed was merely a dead husk. I had already
become one with the host. I give you this chance: Serve me, and you
may live.
TEAL'C
(chokes out)
I will not.
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Then die.
[Kawalsky tightens his hold on Teal'c, who collapses. He stalks outside
and flattens the two guards at the door.]
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
Colonel, I'm doing everything I can.
O'NEILL
So because he wasn't born on this particular planet, he doesn't have
any rights any more? Is that it?
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Kawalsky enters.]
KAWALSKY
Get out!
[He crosses the room to the dialing computer. Davis reaches out a hand
to stop him.]
DAVIS
Major?
[Kawalsky grabs Davis' arm and twists, smacking it down on the desk.
Davis falls.]
DAVIS
Arrghh! Arghh!
[Kawalsky begins the dialing sequence. Alarms go off. In the corridor,
O'Neill and Hammond hear the alarms. Hammond nods to O'Neill, who takes
off.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Teal'c exits the infirmary and sees the two guards on the floor.
Warner runs up.]
WARNER
What happened?
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[In the Control Room, Kawalsky looks at the computer
screen, which flashes "Destruct Sequence Activated."]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld has won. It has taken control of him.
WARNER
But, how?
TEAL'C
It deceived us.
[Teal'c runs off. Two airmen pass him, running in the opposite
direction.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Kawalsky keys in one last command and lowers the blast doors. He makes
his way to the Gate Room. The wormhole has engaged but Teal'c stands in
the center of the ramp, guarding the Stargate.]
KAWALSKY'S GOA'ULD
Jaffa! Kal Shak!
TEAL'C
You cannot pass.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill and Hammond come down the stairs.]
O'NEILL
What?
DAVIS
He set the coordinates for Chulak.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Kawalsky roars and runs up the ramp at Teal'c. They struggle, each
trying to beat the other.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
He set the auto destruct sequence on the failsafe device.
O'NEILL
How'd he have the code?
HAMMOND
I don't know but I need two ranking officers to override, and you're
it.
[O'Neill and Hammond bend over the computer.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Teal'c and Kawalsky struggle. Kawalsky is going for the throat, Teal'c
seems to just be trying to fend him off. Teal'c gets a grip on
Kawalsky's shirt, and pushes him partially into the wormhole. Kawalsky
pushes back out. The fight continues in front of the wormhole.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
All right, that did it. Open the blast doors.
[They doors open and they see Teal'c holding Kawalsky partially in the
wormhole.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c! Hold him there!
[Teal'c pushes Kawalsky's head back into the event horizon.]
O'NEILL
Shut it down! Now!
[The Stargate shuts down. Teal'c lets Kawalsky go. He falls to the
ground; part of his head is missing. O'Neill runs in and up the ramp. A
small piece of the Goa'uld drops out of Kawalsky's head and shrivels
up, smoking. O'Neill and Teal'c kneel beside Kawalsky's body. O'Neill
looks shocked, and covers his mouth.]
TEAL'C
He was your friend.
O'NEILL
(flatly)
My friend died on the table.
[O'Neill gets up and walks away. Teal'c follows.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter and Daniel, in full offworld gear, walk towards the Gate Room.]
CARTER
If anything, the fact that he knew how to set the auto destruct code
proves that there's hope for Sha're and Skaara.
DANIEL
How?
CARTER
Because only Kawalsky could have known that code.
DANIEL
So something of the host must survive?
[Carter nods and walks away. Daniel stands, looking thoughtful.]
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
(speaking on red phone)
Oh, absolutely. That's good to hear. Oh, anytime, sir, you just come
on down, we'd be glad to have you.
(chuckling)
Well, hell, sir, he's right here; why don't you tell him yourself?
I'm sure he'd like to hear it from you.
[Hammond hands the red phone to Kennedy. As Kennedy takes it, Hammond
smiles at O'Neill and motions him to proceed Hammond out of the room.]
KENNEDY
(nervously)
Yes, Mr. President? Yes, sir.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, is SG-1 ready to ship out?
O'NEILL
We are, sir.
HAMMOND
Then you have a go for a standard recon mission on P3-575.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
[The doors open and Teal'c walks through.]
TEAL'C
Reporting as ordered.
O'NEILL
"Sir"...It's "sir".
TEAL'C
Sir.
HAMMOND
Welcome aboard, son.
[O'Neill and Teal'c walk up the ramp to join Daniel and Carter.]
CARTER
The MALP reports conditions on the planet are favorable.
[Together, SG-1 walks up the ramp. They stop in front of the Gate.
O'Neill looks across at his team.]
O'NEILL
Well?
[Together, SG-1 walk into the wormhole.]
