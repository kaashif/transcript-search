[A large pyramid is in the background. In the foreground is a lake with
a Stargate at the water's edge. A couple of death gliders fly
overhead.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--THRONE ROOM
[A Jaffa enters, carrying a staff weapon. The corridor is lined with
armed Jaffa. The Jaffa kneels.]
HER'AK
Lord Khonsu.
[Khonsu is sitting on a throne, behind which hang a number of weapons.]
KHONSU
I have a task for you, Her'ak
HER'AK
How may I serve you, my Lord?
KHONSU
This mission is of great importance so there's not much time. If you
succeed, Anubis himself will be most pleased.
[Her'ak smiles and Khonsu rises from the throne.]
KHONSU
I have learned the location of certain enemies. They are currently
vulnerable. You will take my Ha'tak, capture them and bring them to
me...alive.
HER'AK
My Lord, may I ask who is so valuable?
[Her'ak rises as Khonsu walks towards him.]
KHONSU
Three humans and a Jaffa, known to the Tau'ri as SG-1.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ALIEN PLANET--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP
[The landscape is of ruins and sand. Two men dressed in desert camo are
working among the ruins. One is sitting at some equipment which is
standing on a partially uncovered ring transporter.]
COOMBS
I calculate platform mass at 12.9 metric tons, consistent with the
one on P4X-233.
MEYERS
And every other ring transporter we've measured. Suggests some sort
of standardization, don't you think?
COOMBS
You think the Goa'uld have a big plant somewhere that just stamps
these things out?
MEYERS
Jay, how's it coming with the energy levels left in that power cell?
[There is no reply from Jay, who cannot be seen.]
MEYERS
Jay?
[Meyers walks up to Jay, followed by Coombs. Jay (Felger) is staring
into the distance.]
MEYERS
The power cell?
FELGER
Hmm?
MEYERS
The power cell?
FELGER
Yeah, yeah I'm working on it.
MEYERS
No...
[Meyers snaps his fingers in front of Felger's eyes.]
MEYERS
...you're not.
FELGER
Look at them. They are so cool.
[Felger takes a few paces towards O'Neill and Teal'c who are standing
some twenty feet away.]
COOMBS
Jay, enough already. It's embarrassing.
MEYERS
Not to mention unprofessional.
FELGER
Guys, we're in the presence of greatness here. The best of the best,
and here we are working alongside them. Savour the moment,
gentlemen, savour the moment.
MEYERS
Come on, Felger. We're studying an old piece of Goa'uld technology
and they're babysitting us.
[Meyers walks away. Felger, still staring at O'Neill and Teal'c and
grinning, ignores him.]
FELGER
What do you think they're talking about, right now?
[Coombs shrugs in despair and also walks away.]
O'NEILL
So T, who you taking in the Cup?
[Teal'c looks at O'Neill, puzzled.]
O'NEILL
Lord Stanley's Cup?
[Teal'c raises his left eyebrow.]
O'NEILL
Hockey? Remember, with the ice and skating?
[Teal'c raises both eyebrows slightly.]
O'NEILL
We went to a game last year.
TEAL'C
Indeed. I believe the Canucks of Vancouver are superior warriors.
O'NEILL
Canucks, eh?
[O'Neill pauses for a moment, seemingly surprised.]
O'NEILL
So, lunch?
[O'Neill moves away towards the three scientists. Teal'c follows.
Felger is still watching O'Neill and Teal'c.]
FELGER
Here they come.
[He quickly heads over to Coombs who is standing, holding a laptop
computer. Felger stands on one side of Coombs, with Meyers on the other
side. Felger looks at the monitor, appears to check that O'Neill and
Teal'c are approaching, and gestures.]
FELGER
Yes, yes, that does look like a very important breakthrough. Good
work, Coombs.
[Felger pats Coombs on the back, while Meyers walks away.]
FELGER
Carry on.
[O'Neill and Teal'c walk past Coombs and Felger.]
O'NEILL
Progress, professor?
[Felger rushes to walk alongside O'Neill.]
FELGER
Definitely, yes. Big stuff going on here...big. I can give you a
full report if you want.
O'NEILL
Save it for Carter. We just came here for the fine cuisine.
[O'Neill, Felger and Teal'c have arrived at a table holding a large
container. O'Neill opens the container and looks at the stack of MREs.
He and Teal'c start removing them and read the labels.]
FELGER
Of course, yeah. I mean her...her DHD reports are unbelievable
aren't they? I mean, she is single handedly revolutionizing our
knowledge of Stargate technology.
[He looks at both Teal'c and O'Neill, who seem to be ignoring him as
they look over the MREs.]
FELGER
Any word on how that's going?
O'NEILL
No.
FELGER
No, no.
[O'Neill passes a pouch over to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Turkey?
FELGER
Turkey there.
[Teal'c nods and smiles as he accepts the pouch.]
FELGER
I guess I'll just get back to work, then.
TEAL'C
Are you nearing the completion of your research?
[A crash is heard.]
COOMBS
Ow! Jeez. Who put that scanner there?
[Teal'c raises an eyebrow.]
FELGER
Uh...well, it may be a few more days yet.
O'NEILL
What's your time frame there?
FELGER
Um, a day or so, you know, but then you guys can get right back to
saving the world again...
[Felger quickly thumps O'Neill on the arm a couple of times. O'Neill
looks at his arm then looks at Felger. Felger laughs.]
FELGER
For the seventh time.
TEAL'C
Eighth.
[Felger and O'Neill look at Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
What, you're counting?
[Teal'c raises an eyebrow and shrugs slightly.]
CARTER
(over radio)
Colonel O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Yeah, Carter. Go.
EXT--P5X-112--STARGATE DHD
[The Stargate is shutting down as Jonas walks towards Carter.]
CARTER
We just received an urgent message from General Hammond.
EXT--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP
[Felger is standing very close to O'Neill and listening over his
shoulder. O'Neill almost does a double-take.]
O'NEILL
Roger that. We're on our way.
[There is another crashing sound.]
COOMBS
Oh, good one, that's only worth about two hundred thousand dollars.
O'NEILL
Felger?
[O'Neill pronounces Felger's name incorrectly, as he does throughout
the mission.]
FELGER
Yes?
O'NEILL
We've got to check something out.
FELGER
Can I help?
[O'Neill, Felger and Teal'c walk away from the table. Teal'c grabs his
staff weapon on the way.]
O'NEILL
No. As a matter of fact, stay here. If we're not back in an hour,
get to the gate, dial home. Got it?
FELGER
Well, what could go wrong?
O'NEILL
Got it?
FELGER
Yes, Colonel.
[As O'Neill and Teal'c walk away, Felger stares after them.]
EXT--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP
[Some time later, Felger comes running down the slope into the camp. He
approaches Coombs and Meyers who are kneeling over equipment.]
FELGER
Aren't you guys the slightest bit worried about them?
COOMBS
They'll be back, Felger. Can't you see, they're just having fun with
you.
FELGER
What are you talking about? There's something going on out there.
COOMBS
Oh, please, huh? They're just tired of your butt-snorkeling.
[Coombs rises to face Felger.]
COOMBS
(mockingly)
So tell me how you finally defeated Apophis, Colonel O'Neill. Oh,
Major Carter, I based my doctoral thesis on your amazing wormhole
stability theories.
FELGER
Bite me, Coombs! At least my heroes exist. If this was a Trek
convention you'd be all dressed up like a Klingon.
COOMBS
Vulcan, Felger, Vulcan.
[Coombs and Felger face off against each other.]
COOMBS
And I don't know how you can call yourself a scientist and not
worship at the alter of Roddenberry.
FELGER
(mockingly)
Oooh, how we gonna get outta this one Captain? Oh, I don't know,
something to do with a tachyon emitter.
MEYERS
Guys, knock it off. Now, what say we hook up the Naquadah generator
and see if we can't get this baby started.
FELGER
Fine.
COOMBS
Good.
FELGER
(under his breath to Coombs)
Nerd.
COOMBS
(to Felger)
Geek.
[Suddenly, a ship flies overhead, casting a large shadow over the area.
Coombs buries his head in his arms and Felger ducks, but quickly looks
up to watch the ship, which has headed over the hill. All three stand.]
MEYERS
Was that what I think it was?
FELGER
An Alkesh. Mid range Goa'uld attack vessel.
COOMBS
But this planet was supposedly abandoned centuries ago. There isn't
even anything here except...
FELGER
SG-1.
[Felger runs to grab a radio off a box.]
FELGER
(into radio)
Colonel O'Neill, Felger. We just saw an Alkesh.
EXT--P5X-112--RUINS NEAR STARGATE
[O'Neill and Carter are sheltering behind some ruins. As O'Neill fires
his weapon, a zat is discharged.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
I know! Stay put! Remember what I told you. Wait till it's clear,
get to the gate, report to Hammond.
[Jonas is behind another wall, firing a zat.]
EXT--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP
[The three scientists can hear gunfire in the distance.]
FELGER
(into radio)
Colonel O'Neill? Major Carter?
EXT--P5X-112--RUINS NEAR STARGATE
[The Alkesh is hovering over the Stargate. Transporter rings ascend
into the ship. Zats are being fired, as well as O'Neill's P-90 and
Teal'c's staff weapon. The Alkesh fires multiple rounds behind SG-1,
creating a wall of fire.]
EXT--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP
[The noise of the battle can be clearly heard.]
FELGER
Oh, they're in trouble.
[Felger runs off in the direction of the gunfire.]
COOMBS
Hey! Where you going Felger? He told us to stay put.
[Meyers and Coombs reluctantly run after Felger.]
FELGER
(into radio)
Colonel O'Neill? Major Carter?
EXT--P5X-112--NEAR STARGATE
[Felger comes to an overhang and scrambles down to lie on his stomach.]
FELGER
Oh, no. Oh...
MEYERS
This is ridiculous, Felger. You're gonna get us...
[Meyers and Coombs run up to him. Felger turns to grab Meyers' leg to
pull him to the ground.]
FELGER
Shut up.
[Meyers, in turn, grabs Coombs' arm to pull him down.]
FELGER
Look.
COOMBS
Oh, my God.
[Felger gestures ahead, where SG-1 are being led by the Jaffa towards
the Alkesh.]
EXT--P5X-112
[The three scientist are running back to the ruins and the science
camp.]
COOMBS
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You mean do something? What do you mean, do
something? You're totally out of your mind, Felger. Mission protocol
clearly states that if something goes wrong, we are to return to
Stargate Command immediately and you know what? Something went
wrong.
MEYERS
Colonel O'Neill said it himself. We have to go back to Earth.
FELGER
I know what he said, but I'm the senior advisor on this mission and
I'm making a command decision.
MEYERS
You're a lecturer in residence at M.I.T.
FELGER
Laugh all you want, but I studied every mission SG-1's ever been on,
and the one thing they all have in common? They never leave a man
behind. Ever.
[Felger grabs the naquadah generator.]
COOMBS
Technically, they're not behind. We are.
FELGER
Meyers, you go back through the gate, tell General Hammond what's
happened.
[Felger turns to walk away.]
COOMBS
What about us?
FELGER
We're going after SG-1.
COOMBS
No, really.
[Felger kneels and places the generator by the ring transporter.]
FELGER
You know, that ship must have taken them back to the mother ship out
in orbit. We can use this platform to ring up to it but we have to
act now before they're out of range.
COOMBS
No, really.
[Felger opens a small panel on the transporter.]
FELGER
What? You want their death on your heads?
[Felger gets up, followed by Coombs and heads over to a number of
cases.]
COOMBS
You're just adding our deaths to theirs.
FELGER
(To Meyers)
Would you go?
[Meyers grimaces at Felger then turns to leave. Felger, carrying a
couple of cases, and Coombs return to the transporter.]
FELGER
Help me calibrate this.
COOMBS
Jay, we haven't run any tests, we have no idea how stable any link
will be, assuming we can even get one.
[Felger has removed a crystal from the open panel and places a probe in
its place. A number of other crystals light up.]
FELGER
We're not out of range.
COOMBS
Jay? Are you sure about this?
FELGER
Think about it, Simon. What would Colonel O'Neill do if he was here
now?
[Felger hands a pistol to Coombs.]
COOMBS
You want me to shoot you?
FELGER
Let's go.
COOMBS
All right.
[As Felger and Coombs step into the rings, they activate.]
EXT--SPACE
[The rings beam up to the mothership.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP
[As soon as the rings deposit Felger and Coombs and deactivate, Felger
covers his eyes, starts shooting and turns in a circle. Coombs ducks
and falls to the ground as the shooting starts. As Felger stops
shooting, Coombs rises, very agitated.]
COOMBS
Nicely done. We were alone, but that'll probably change now.
[Felger motions with his hand.]
FELGER
Please, shh...just...okay. Area secure. Let's move out.
[Coombs, obviously not happy, follows Felger to a doorway. Both jump
back as the door automatically opens. They walk through into a
corridor.]
EXT--SGC CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Alarms are sounding. Davis is sitting at a terminal. Hammond comes up
behind him.]
HAMMOND
What've we got, Sergeant?
DAVIS
It's SG-1's code, sir.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[Hammond leaves the Control Room.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[A number of armed SFs are aiming at the Stargate. Hammond enters just
as Meyers comes through the gate.]
MEYERS
(out of breath)
SG-1...they...took...SG-1.
[Meyers virtually collapses into Hammond's arms at the bottom of the
ramp.]
HAMMOND
Slow down, son. Take it easy. Where's the rest of your team?
MEYERS
(out of breath)
Ship, lots of Jaffa, SG-1 captured, flew away, sir.
[Hammond gestures for the SFs to lower their weapons.]
HAMMOND
Where are professors Felger and Coombs?
MEYERS
They used the rings at the ruins to go up to the ship, to rescue
SG-1.
HAMMOND
They did what?
INT--MOTHERSHIP
[Coombs and Felger are crawling through a small shaft.]
COOMBS
Damn it, Felger. This cannot be the way.
FELGER
I swear...
[Felger stops and tries to open a panel but is unable to.]
FELGER
...it's up here and to the left.
COOMBS
That's what you said three lefts ago.
FELGER
Head!
[Coombs hits his head on the shaft roof. Felger laughs.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CELL
[Teal'c and O'Neill are sitting on a bench, with Jonas and Carter
sitting across the room from them.]
CARTER
(to Jonas)
How come you're not smiling?
JONAS
Should I be?
CARTER
Well, it is your first time being capture by a Goa'uld.
[Both Carter and Jonas smile.]
JONAS
Funny.
[Jonas sighs and lies his head back against the wall.]
JONAS
So what now?
TEAL'C
We wait.
JONAS
Shouldn't we be trying to escape?
O'NEILL
Oddly, no. It won't be long.
JONAS
Before what?
O'NEILL
Oh, some overdressed, over the top bad guy floats in gloating about
whatever evil fate awaits us.
[Jonas nods, eyebrows raised. O'Neill pauses, listening.]
O'NEILL
Wait for it.
[Both outer and inner doors to the cell open. Her'ak enters, followed
by a number of Jaffa.]
O'NEILL
See?
[O'Neill and Teal'c stand.]
HER'AK
Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter. The so-called greatest of all Tau'ri
warriors. And the Shol'va, Teal'c.
[O'Neill turns to grasp Teal'c's shoulder and pat him on the back.
Her'ak turns to Jonas.]
HER'AK
You, I'm not familiar with.
O'NEILL
He's new.
CARTER
Who are you?
HER'AK
I am Her'ak, First Prime to Lord Khonsu of Amon Shek.
O'NEILL
Very impressive. Got a resum?
[Her'ak smirks.]
HER'AK
I captured you.
O'NEILL
Yes. Right. You did. Well done. You've got the job.
HER'AK
I had been looking forward to a greater challenge than the one you
provided. However, the result has yielded the same consequence. You
belong to my master now.
[Her'ak and the Jaffa leave.]
O'NEILL
Carter, be honest. The resum gag...?
TEAL'C
It needs work, O'Neill.
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership is heading for a wormhole.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR
[A wall panel falls to the floor.]
FELGER
Shhh.
COOMBS
I didn't do anything.
[Coombs and Felger climb out of the vent. Felger, holding his weapon,
crouches and scuttles over to the other side of the corridor.]
COOMBS
You have no idea where you're going.
FELGER
Of course I do.
COOMBS
Oh yeah, then what were we doing in the vent?
FELGER
Staying out of sight. Would you stop worrying? I've studied
blueprints of these motherships. Holding cells are this way.
COOMBS
Oh please, you've studied Goa'uld mothership blueprints?
FELGER
Information's an SG team's greatest ally.
[As Felger crouches and scampers along the corridor, Coombs walks
along.]
COOMBS
You know what an SG team's greatest ally is? An SG team!
FELGER
Will you relax? Okay, it's this way.
[Felger heads off, followed by Coombs. Some seconds later they return
and move off down another corridor.]
FELGER
No, this way.
COOMBS
I'm gonna kill you.
[Felger again scampers down the corridor, weapon held up with both
hands next to his face.]
COOMBS
Would you quit doing that?
[Felger turns around to face Coombs.]
FELGER
This?
COOMBS
Don't point the gun!
[Both men head off around a corner.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CELL
[Jonas and Carter are looking up at a large vent, obviously hearing
whistling which is coming via the vent.]
JONAS
Is that a bird?
TEAL'C
I do not believe so.
[Teal'c and O'Neill stand. O'Neill goes over to the vent.]
FELGER
(quietly, through the vent)
These panels are held in place magnetically. We have to cut the
power.
[O'Neill leans closer to the panel.]
O'NEILL
Who is that?
FELGER
Colonel O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Felger?
[Felger removes the panel.]
FELGER
Oh, Colonel O'Neill. Are you all right, sir?
O'NEILL
(frustrated)
What are you doing here?
FELGER
Stand easy, we're here to rescue you.
[Felger grins.]
CARTER
Did he say we?
FELGER
That's right. I have Coombs with me.
[Coombs appears in the vent.]
COOMBS
Hi.
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Why, look everybody, he's got Coombs with him.
FELGER
You can thank us later. Right now we have to get you out.
O'NEILL
(angrily)
Felger! Just what part of gate home did you not understand?
FELGER
Well, we just couldn't let our fellow SG team members be taken...
O'NEILL
Felger!
FELGER
What about never leave a man behind?
O'NEILL
What about we allowed ourselves to be captured.
(furious)
On purpose.
COOMBS
Oh.
FELGER
You what?
O'NEILL
We're on a mission, you nit!
[Felger and Coombs look at each other sheepishly.]
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership is heading for a wormhole.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CELL
[O'Neill and Teal'c are glaring at Felger and Coombs, who are now out
of the vent.]
FELGER
Please don't be angry, we just thought...
[Felger grins nervously as Coombs points at him.]
COOMBS
It was Felger all the way. His idea completely.
FELGER
Okay, well, I don't understand. I mean, what do you mean you're on a
mission?
CARTER
The Goa'uld we're being taken to see is actually an undercover
Tok'ra.
FELGER
Oh, yeah Oh.
COOMBS
I see. Uh, well, why the ruse?
TEAL'C
Very few of Khonsu's Jaffa know his true identity. Her'ak and his
men had to believe they had truly captured us.
FELGER
See, I knew it was too easy. I mean, you guys have taken out more
Jaffa than that before, right?
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Professor, we know you meant well but you've actually put us in a
really awkward position.
FELGER
Well, why not tell us?
O'NEILL
Because you didn't need to know.
CARTER
We've been on standby for weeks, waiting to hear from the Tok'ra.
Now, we didn't know where or when this ambush would occur.
Obviously, you weren't supposed to be there when it went down, but
when we finally did get the word it was too late to send you home
first.
FELGER
Why didn't this Khonsu just, you know, send the intel to you? I
mean, why the big song and dance?
JONAS
He's collected vital information on how and where Anubis is getting
his new technology.
TEAL'C
As we have said, Khonsu's true loyalties are carefully hidden. He
could trust no one to carry such information in his place.
CARTER
He needs to remain undercover to continue his work.
O'NEILL
So did we.
[Coombs thumps Felger on the arm.]
COOMBS
Way to go, Felger.
FELGER
Wait a minute, we got up here undetected. We haven't ruined anything
yet. Nobody knows we're here.
[Teal'c turns to the door, obviously hearing footsteps,]
TEAL'C
Someone approaches.
[A Jaffa and guard enter. O'Neill stands nonchalantly by a wall.]
DOL'OK
I am Dol'ok, free Jaffa, loyal to Khonsu the Tok'ra.
[Carter, Teal'c and Jonas are standing shoulder to shoulder. They all
nod at Dol'ok. The guard checks that no-one is approaching.]
DOL'OK
Thank you for your patience.
O'NEILL
What patience? Can we get our weapons back? Not that we don't trust
you.
DOL'OK
Soon. As you are aware, this incarceration is for your own
protection. There are very few of us among the ranks but we have
come to assure you that you are indeed not alone.
[Dol'ok notices two pairs of feet behind Carter, Teal'c and Jonas.
Felger and Coombs show themselves either side of Teal'c.]
DOL'OK
Who are they?
[Felger and Coombs duck down.]
O'NEILL
Look, there's been a little bit of a mix up here. Any chance you
could put these guys someplace safe, relatively secure, till this is
over?
DOL'OK
I will do what I can.
O'NEILL
Appreciate that.
[O'Neill pats Dol'ok's shoulder.]
O'NEILL
(to Felger and Coombs)
Hey!
[O'Neill gestures for them to step out. Felger pauses and gives O'Neill
an apologetic look. Both men follow Dol'ok and the cell doors close
behind them.]
O'NEILL
Oy.
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET
[A large pyramid is in the background. In the foreground is a lake with
a Stargate at the water's edge. A number of death gliders fly
overhead.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID
[Her'ak appears on a large screen. A couple of guards are in the room.
Khonsu steps closer to the screen.]
HER'AK
As ordered, we have SG-1 alive and uninjured.
KHONSU
Excellent. You have done well, Her'ak. I will be sure to tell Lord
Anubis of your exemplary conduct when I relay this victory to him.
INT--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM
HER'AK
My thanks. Shall I interrogate the prisoners on your behalf, my
lord? Surely there is much that they can reveal?
[Khonsu appears on a large screen.]
KHONSU
No. When you arrive, bring them before me. I will use my own methods
to learn what they know.
HER'AK
As you wish, my lord.
[As the image of Khonsu fades, Her'ak turns away and sneers.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CARGO BAY
[Felger and Coombs are sitting behind storage crates, as another crate
is moved into position to hide them.]
DOL'OK
Please do not venture from this place until we have returned. Should
you be discovered your lives would be forfeit.
COOMBS
You got it.
FELGER
You try to help people, this is the thanks you get.
COOMBS
I should have shot you.
[Another crate is moved into position to completely hide them.]
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership is orbiting a planet. A transporter beam is being fed
from the ship to the pyramid on the planet.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CORRIDOR
[Her'ak leads SG-1 through the pyramid, flanked by guards.]
O'NEILL
So, when do we get to meet this old Ginsu guy?
[Her'ak opens a large doorway and SG-1 step through.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CELL
O'NEILL
Nice.
[The room is circular, with a central platform edged with hip-high
walls with three entrances. Her'ak gestures for the team to step onto
the platform. Once SG-1 are on the platform, a force field flows
upwards from the walls. Her'ak turns to leave. O'Neill reaches out to
touch the force field, which obviously hurts.]
O'NEILL
Ah!
(to Carter and Teal'c)
Don't touch that.
(to Her'ak)
Hey, Her'ak!
[Her'ak stops in the doorway and turns back to face SG-1.]
O'NEILL
What, no gloating? Take some pride in your work, son.
HER'AK
You shall all be forced to bow before my master soon enough.
[Her'ak and the guards leave the room. Jonas shakes his head as the
door closes. O'Neill sighs and shrugs.]
O'NEILL
You know, this whole imprisoned for our own protection is getting a
little old.
CARTER
What choice did we have? If we want this information, we have to
trust Khonsu.
[O'Neill shrugs in agreement.]
INT--MOTHERSHIP CARGO BAY
[Felger and Coombs are sitting behind the crates. Felger has his head
in his hands.]
COOMBS
I knew I should have updated my will before agreeing to off-world
assignments.
FELGER
You are not going to die, Coombs.
COOMBS
Oh, come on, Felger. We might as well be wearing red shirts.
FELGER
I don't get that?
[Coombs is about to speak as the bay door opens. Dol'ok and another
Jaffa enter. Felger and Coombs look from behind the crates. A staff
blast from the corridor hits the Jaffa in the back. Dol'ok goes for his
weapon but is also shot. Three Jaffa enter and the first one kicks
Dol'ok.]
JAFFA
Shol'va!
[The lead Jaffa looks towards the crates hiding Felger and Coombs but
then all three Jaffa leave and the door closes behind them. Felger
pushes aside the crates to look at Dol'ok and the dead Jaffa.]
COOMBS
Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna throw up.
FELGER
Oh, these poor bastards.
COOMBS
Jay, I can't do this. I've gotta get out of here.
[Coombs moves from behind the crates, heading for the door.]
FELGER
Simon, Simon, Simon, Simon.
[Felger grabs Coombs.]
COOMBS
No! I'm not a soldier. I teach applied math at Yale! I have a vespa
and two cats.
FELGER
(quietly)
Just get a hold of yourself! Don't you get it Simon? Jaffa do not
kill each other for fun.
COOMBS
They don't?
[Coombs gestures at Dol'ok.]
FELGER
Okay. I don't know that for sure. I don't. But this looks like an
execution. Something hinky's definitely going on here and it's up to
you and I to find out what it is.
COOMBS
Hinky?
FELGER
Yeah, it's a word.
COOMBS
In what dictionary?
FELGER
I have a plan.
[Felger grins.]
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE
[A number of Jaffa are guarding the area. A transporter ring activates,
unloading Felger and Coombs dressed as Jaffa. They move away, passing
many of the other Jaffa. Both look uncomfortable. As they reach an area
with no Jaffa in sight, Coombs puts on his glasses.]
COOMBS
Is it okay for me to have a heart attack now? God, I don't know why
I let you talk me into this.
[They are walking though a wooded area.]
FELGER
Because if we stayed on that ship we'd both be dead right now and
you know it.
COOMBS
Oh yeah, and we're better off down here?
FELGER
When are you going to start trusting me, Simon? I have four post
graduate degrees.
COOMBS
And not one of them cover Jaffa military tactics.
[As they step up a slight incline, a Jaffa appears behind them.]
JAFFA
What are you doing here?
[Felger and Coombs turn slowly to face the Jaffa.]
COOMBS
Uh.
FELGER
(put-on deeper voice)
He is sick. I believe it is something he ate.
[Coombs nods then vomits. Felger zats the Jaffa.]
FELGER
Nicely done, nicely done.
[Felger pats a shocked Coombs on the arm.]
COOMBS
Jay, you just shot that guy. I mean you really shot him.
FELGER
No, zatted, that's completely different.
COOMBS
Zatted...shot...
FELGER
Come on, gotta go, gotta go.
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--PYRAMID
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--THRONE ROOM
[Khonsu is seated on the throne, with a number of Jaffa guards lining
the room. Her'ak enters with several other Jaffa.]
KHONSU
Her'ak.
[Her'ak stands before the throne. Felger and Coombs--no longer wearing
his glasses--enter the room and stand at the back, behind a number of
Jaffa.]
KHONSU
Where are the prisoners?
[Her'ak does not reply. Khonsu stands.]
KHONSU
Answer me. Where is SG-1?
HER'AK
They are no longer your concern.
[Her'ak activates his staff weapon and shoots Khonsu, who collapses to
the ground. Felger and Coombs look around in shock, as do the other
Jaffa, who activate their weapons towards Her'ak. Her'ak steps up to
the platform and faces the Jaffa.]
HER'AK
We are betrayed, brothers. Our God was not who he claimed to be.
[Khonsu turns over onto his back.]
HER'AK
Khonsu is Tok'ra.
[The Jaffa deactivate their staff weapons.]
HER'AK
He would weaken us like a cancer from within, destroying our one
true God. Anubis.
[Her'ak again fires on Khonsu.]
HER'AK
I am in command now, until our lord returns to reward us and claim
his prize. Spread the word among every rank. Be ready.
[Her'ak sits on Khonsu's throne.]
HER'AK
Anubis is coming.
[SG-1 are led into the room. O'Neill looks around.]
O'NEILL
Where's Khonsu?
HER'AK
Khonsu is dead.
O'NEILL
Dead? Completely dead or semi-dead? You guys seem to have a grey
area in that regard.
HER'AK
His true loyalties were well known. Once his betrayal bore fruit,
his existence was no longer required.
O'NEILL
You calling us fruit?
[O'Neill elbows the Jaffa standing behind him in the face. Teal'c grabs
another Jaffa and his staff weapon. Another Jaffa, on the platform with
Her'ak, zats both O'Neill and Teal'c, who fall to the floor. Carter and
Jonas struggle but are held by Jaffa. Felger and Coombs, armed with
staff weapons, stand at the rear. Her'ak smirks nastily, and picks up a
pain-stick. O'Neill turns over on to his back, while Teal'c is held up
by a couple of Jaffa. Her'ak steps up to O'Neill and uses the
pain-stick on him. O'Neill yells in pain.]
O'NEILL
Ah! Crap! I hate that thing.
[Her'ak smirks.]
HER'AK
Now that, Colonel O'Neill, is what I call pride in my work.
O'NEILL
Good job!
HER'AK
I want names, Colonel, of all the Tok'ra hiding within Anubis'
ranks.
O'NEILL
Oh, ask Khonsu. Oh wait, you can't, you killed him.
[Her'ak again uses the pain-stick on O'Neill, as Jonas struggles to get
free.]
HER'AK
Tell me!
O'NEILL
We don't know anything.
CARTER
He's not lying. Our orders were to make contact with Khonsu. That's
it. Any information you want died with him.
O'NEILL
Forget it, Carter. He's just the warm up band and he knows it.
HER'AK
No matter what you have endured, you have never experienced the
likes of what Anubis is capable of.
[O'Neill stares up at Her'ak, who has returned to the platform.]
O'NEILL
You ended that sentence with a preposition. Bastard!
[Carter, Jonas and Teal'c are led from the room, as O'Neill is dragged
to his feet and taken out. Felger and Coombs watch them leave, looking
worried.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Davis is seated at a terminal, with Hammond sitting next to him.]
HAMMOND
That was his last transmission?
DAVIS
Yes, sir.
[Hammond rises as Meyers enters.]
MEYERS
Excuse me, sir. Anything on SG-1?
HAMMOND
As a matter of fact, we just got a message from one of our Jaffa
allies. Apparently, word has filtered through Anubis' ranks that
Khonsu was exposed as a Tok'ra and that he's been murdered.
MEYERS
Oh, no.
HAMMOND
SG-1 is still in the custody of the Jaffa who've overthrown Khonsu
and Anubis himself is on the way. There's been no mention of Felger
and Coombs.
MEYERS
Is there no chance of mounting some sort of rescue? I'd be happy to
volunteer.
HAMMOND
I appreciate that, but the planet's very heavily guarded. That was
one of the reasons SG-1 had to go in undercover.
[Hammond turns to walk away.]
MEYERS
Sir, with all due respect, I thought you didn't leave people behind?
HAMMOND
I don't like this any more than you do, but I'm not going to send
good men to their deaths for nothing, especially considering the
sketchy nature of the intel we have on the situation. There's just
nothing we can do at this time. I'm afraid, if SG-1 is going to get
out of this mess, they're going to have to do it on their own.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CORRIDOR
[Felger crouches around a corner and grabs Coombs who walks out, almost
uncaring.]
FELGER
Don't do that.
[Felger creeps through the room from pillar to pillar, followed by
Coombs, who is speaking loudly.]
COOMBS
All right. So maybe you did study Goa'uld mothership plans, but how
can you possibly know where we're going now?
FELGER
(whispering)
I don't.
COOMBS
Jay, this is bad.
FELGER
I know!
COOMBS
Look, our best shot is just to get back to SGC, tell them what
happened, where SG-1 is and...
FELGER
Look, even if we could get through the gate, there's no telling when
Anubis will arrive. Chances are SG-1 will be long gone or dead by
the time they mount a rescue mission, if they're willing to send one
at all.
COOMBS
Well, all right, what about SG-1 then, huh? If they're the big
heroes you say they are then they can just bust themselves out.
FELGER
Come on, Coombs! This op is up to us and you know it.
COOMBS
Op?
FELGER
Op, op, op, op! It's operation.
COOMBS
Well, just say operation then. Say operation like normal people.
FELGER
Keep your voice down.
[A door opens and Felger and Coombs enter a large circular room.]
FELGER
We have to learn everything we can about this place, find some
weakness and exploit it.
[The room appears empty, apart from a large, tall pillar.]
COOMBS
Uh huh. How the heck are we supposed to do that?
[Felger walks up to the pillar and presses a button. The pillar slides
open to reveal a control panel.]
COOMBS
How'd you know how to do that?
FELGER
Well, the writing in the hall said this was the control room.
COOMBS
It did?
FELGER
I thought you said you read Goa'uld.
COOMBS
I do, sort of.
[Both men sit at a chair at the control panel.]
FELGER
Well, this should be able to tell us everything we need to know.
[They start moving crystals around. A large holo-screen appears before
them, with writings and diagrams flashing past.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CELL
CARTER
This is not good.
FELGER
(over intercom)
SG-1. This is Felger.
[O'Neill bolts upright.]
FELGER
(over intercom)
Do you copy? Colonel O'Neill?
[SG-1 look around the room, bemused.]
O'NEILL
No. This is not good.
FELGER
(over intercom)
Don't be mad, sir. Are you all right? Is everyone else with you?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Where are you?
[O'Neill stands and looks to the ceiling.]
FELGER
(over intercom)
We're inside the pyramid, sir. We're hiding in the control room.
[O'Neill gestures in irritation.]
CARTER
Colonel, they could have access to the pyramid security systems
including force shield controls.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
FELGER
We're working on it.
CARTER
(over intercom)
You should be able to bring up the pyramid schematics. Within the
security system files you'll find a list of force shield codes.
[A holo-image of the pyramid appears before Felger and Coombs.]
COOMBS
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here, Major. Okay
O'NEILL
(over intercom)
Felger, we need weapons.
COOMBS
(to Felger)
Um, looks like there's an armoury at the end of the hall.
[Felger rises to leave.]
COOMBS
(to Felger)
Either that or a bathroom.
[Felger turns back to Coombs.]
FELGER
Wwh...
COOMBS
I can do this.
[Coombs moves to the centre of the chair and gestures Felger away.]
FELGER
(into intercom)
On my way, sir.
[Felger grins and laughs.]
FELGER
(To Coombs)
You get the shield down and use your radio from now on.
[Felger leaves and Coombs presses buttons on the panel.]
COOMBS
This is unbelievable. Everything is in here.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CELL
O'NEILL
Coombs. What's going on?
COOMBS
(over intercom)
I've almost got it.
[The force field de-activates.]
O'NEILL
Nice.
[O'Neill pauses where the force field used to be, waves his hand
through the area then moves forward when he is not shocked by the force
field.]
O'NEILL
Nice.
[As O'Neill reaches the doorway, he gestures for Teal'c to stand
opposite him so that they are flanking the door. As the door opens,
Teal'c moves to attack the newcomer but pulls back when he sees that
it's Felger. Felger drops a number of zats which he is carrying. Carter
and Teal'c pick up the zats, and Felger hands one to Jonas. O'Neill
grabs Felger's arm.]
O'NEILL
All right, look professor, this little stunt of yours does not
excuse the fact that you disobeyed a direct order. From me. Twice.
[Felger, looking sheepish, removes the Jaffa skull cap.]
O'NEILL
Do it again I'll shoot you. Are we...?
[Felger responds quickly.]
FELGER
...Crystal.
O'NEILL
Good.
FELGER
Do you wanna hear the rest of my plan?
[Felger grins at O'Neill.]
COOMBS
(over the intercom)
Our plan.
FELGER
(via radio)
I said stay on the radio.
O'NEILL
Just...tell me what you know.
FELGER
Okay. There's a shield around the pyramid. The Stargate's outside
that.
CARTER
So Coombs could get the shield down.
FELGER
Right. Then all we have to do is take out the Jaffa guarding the
gate. Coombs can ring himself out to the ring platform and then we
all go home.
[Felger laughs.]
FELGER
Piece of cake.
O'NEILL
We take out the Jaffa.
FELGER
We...as in you.
O'NEILL
How many?
FELGER
A dozen, tops.
O'NEILL
A dozen?
FELGER
Yeah, and they got some of those really big guns.
O'NEILL
Good plan, Felger, good plan.
FELGER
Come on, you're SG-1, this is what you do.
[Jonas, Carter and Teal'c look at each other as O'Neill ponders.]
O'NEILL
Right.
[O'Neill leads the others out of the cell.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CORRIDOR
[O'Neill walks down the pillar-lined room, followed by the others.]
O'NEILL
(via radio, quietly)
Coombs, talk to me.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[Coombs is studying a map on the holo-imager before him.]
COOMBS
(into radio)
Okay, hang another left and then two rights and then there'll be a
door and beyond that is daylight.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM
[O'Neill gestures for Carter and Felger to go to the doorway. Carter
enters a code but the door remains closed. She turns to O'Neill,
shrugging.]
O'NEILL
Felger?
FELGER
(into radio)
Coombs?
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[Coombs is obviously frustrated. He pulls off his skull cap.]
COOMBS
(into radio)
I'm sorry. This coding is very confusing. Just wait a second.
[Coombs presses some more buttons.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM
[Felger is staring at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
What?
[Felger walks up to O'Neill as Carter enters another code on the door
panel.]
FELGER
I can't believe that I'm here...with you...like this. It's...
O'NEILL
Yeah, I'm having the same problem.
FELGER
This is great! You know, sneaking around with you guys in a Goa'uld
pyramid on some alien planet. The only thing missing is some Jaffa
chasing us.
[Teal, who has been guarding the doorway into the room, enters and
stands behind a pillar. Footsteps can be heard.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
FELGER
Okay, that's not my fault because there's no possible...
(into radio)
Simon? Simon, hurry up, we've got company.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
COOMBS
Wait, wait, wait!
[Coombs is urgently reading the holo-image.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM
[O'Neill grabs Felger's radio.]
O'NEILL
Give me that.
(into radio)
Now! Coombs.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[Coombs presses a number of buttons on the panel.]
COOMBS
I got it!
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM
[The door opens and Felger leaves, followed by SG-1. A number of Jaffa
enter the room but walk through, without noticing the open door.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
COOMBS
(into radio)
Shield is down.
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--FOREST
FELGER
Way to go, Simon!
O'NEILL
(furious)
Shush.
(into radio)
Get your ass to the nearest ring transport and wait for my signal.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[Coombs switches off the panel and runs over to the doorway.]
COOMBS
Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've been a great audience, but I
really must be...
[The door opens to reveal a number of Jaffa on the other side. Coombs
reaches over to the panel to close the door.]
JAFFA
You! Stop!
COOMBS
Staying. God.
[Coombs runs to hide behind the control panel.]
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA
[The area is guarded by a number of Jaffa.]
O'NEILL
Well, he wasn't kidding, that's a lot of Jaffa. Carter, Jonas, your
target is that centre gun placement.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, you're with me.
(pointedly, to Felger)
Now, is there anything else we need to discuss?
FELGER
No, sir, No, sir. I'm going to stay in this very spot. Even if I see
you writhing in agony, calling my name, I'll be here.
O'NEILL
Exactly. On my signal, get Coombs out here.
[O'Neill hands the radio to Felger, then SG-1 move out. Jonas and
Carter zat a couple of Jaffa as O'Neill zats two more. As another Jaffa
walks alongside the lake, Teal'c launches out of the water, drags the
Jaffa under and kills him.]
COOMBS
(over radio)
Jay...uh...I've got a problem here.
FELGER
(into radio)
Shhh.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[A large crack appears in the door as the Jaffa ram against it. Coombs
is sitting down behind the control panel.]
COOMBS
(into radio)
I think I need a little help.
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA
[More of the Jaffa are shot down. As Carter and Jonas near the large
gun placement, they are fired upon. The Jaffa swivels the large weapon
around towards them. They put up their hands as they see this, but
before the Jaffa can fire, the weapon explodes. Teal'c, standing at
another large gun, has fired on the Jaffa. He turns the gun towards
more Jaffa, as O'Neill continues to zat even more.]
O'NEILL
Clear?
[Carter and Jonas run towards him.]
CARTER
Clear, sir.
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[Teal'c runs in from another direction.]
TEAL'C
The area is secure for the moment, O'Neill.
FELGER
(yelling)
Colonel O'Neill. Colonel O'Neill! Colonel O'Neill.
[Felger runs towards them.]
O'NEILL
What are you doing? Get Coombs out here.
FELGER
There's a slight problem there, sir. He's stuck.
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[The crack in the door is now much larger.]
COOMBS
(into radio)
Jay. I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here. You just go, you
take care of my cats, okay?
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA
FELGER
(into radio)
No, no, no, no, Simon. I got us into this mess. If you're staying,
I'm staying too.
O'NEILL
No one's staying! Can he ring us in?
FELGER
(into radio)
Coombs, can you ring Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c into the pyramid?
COOMBS
(over radio)
I'll try.
[O'Neill and Teal'c stand inside the ring platform.]
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Give us five minutes and then...
[They are ringed up.]
INT--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM
[As the crack in the door widens further, Coombs, now hiding behind the
chair, hears zats firing outside the door. The battering at the door
stops. Coombs walks closer to the doorway but jumps back when the
hammering starts again. As the door collapses, Coombs, almost in tears,
sees O'Neill on the other side.]
O'NEILL
Let's go home.
COOMBS
Oh, thank God!
EXT--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA
[O'Neill, Coombs and Teal'c are ringed back outside. They run to the
Stargate, where Carter, Jonas and Felger are standing at the top of the
steps. As they run, they are fired on.]
FELGER
Simon, are you okay?
O'NEILL
Later!
[Felger and Carter go through the gate. A number of Jaffa run towards
the Stargate, firing. As Jonas, Coombs and Teal'c enter the gate,
O'Neill stops at the top, turns to Her'ak who is leading the Jaffa,
shrugs and smiles. A staff blast hits the Stargate and O'Neill jumps
back then goes through the gate.]
EXT--SGC CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX DAY
EXT--SGC GATEROOM
[Felger and Coombs enter the festooned gate room and step up the
red-carpeted ramp to a podium at the foot of the Stargate. Carter,
O'Neill and Hammond are at the podium. A number of personnel are also
in the gate room.]
HAMMOND
For bravery in the face of grave danger, I hereby award Simon Coombs
and Jay Felger, each, the Air Force Civilian Award for Valour.
[O'Neill removes two medals from their boxes and turns to face Coombs
and Felger. He places the medal on Coombs first.]
O'NEILL
Despite the fact that you gentlemen disobeyed my orders, which, in
my little world, constitutes screwing up...twice. The truth is, we
wouldn't be here without you. You are true heroes.
FELGER
Thank you, Colonel.
[O'Neill shakes hands with both Felger and Coombs. Meyers, in the
crowd, puts both thumbs up to them. Carter shakes Coombs' hand and
kisses him on the cheek as the crowd starts to applaud. She shakes
Felger's hand then holds his face in both hands and gives him a long
kiss on the mouth.]
COOMBS
(as the kiss is going on)
Felger!
EXT--SGC LAB
COOMBS
Felger, Jay.
[Coombs pokes Felger in the cheek.]
FELGER
Ow. What?
COOMBS
Snap out of it.
FELGER
Yeah, sorry.
COOMBS
Calibration scales for the ring power source?
[Felger hands Coombs a clipboard.]
FELGER
Right there, right...there.
COOMBS
Geek.
FELGER
Nerd.
