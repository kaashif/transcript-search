TITLE
Message In A Bottle
TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--P5C 353
[SG-1 are on a moonlike surface in astronaut suits.]
O'NEILL
Anybody home?
DANIEL
Jack, it may as well be the moon out here. If there ever was anybody
home, they've been gone a hundred thousand years or more.
INT--CORRIDOR LEADING INTO A HALL
[SG-1 enter.]
TEAL'C
This world is definitely Tal'ac. Though it once supported life, it
is now extinct.
CARTER
Well, the probe picked up an EM source coming from something.
O'NEILL
My guess...that thing.
[O'Neill's flashlight shines upon a small globe like structure on top
of a pedestal. SG-1 approaches the pedestal to get a better look.]
CARTER
It has the same EM frequency we picked up from the probe. Sir, this
artifact or whatever it is, is definitely the source.
O'NEILL
Are we in danger?
CARTER
No sir, I don't think so. Not at the moment. But, I mean this is
incredible. If Daniel is right, this artifact has been doing this
since Neanderthals were still a dominant species on earth.
O'NEILL
Ah, that takes me back.
DANIEL
Look at this writing of some kind, it's so tiny.
O'NEILL
What does it do?
CARTER
Well, it's maintaining an interior temperature of thirty three
degrees Fahrenheit, it's generating an electromagnetic field and
emitting small amounts of alpha, gamma, and delta radiation.
O'NEILL
Well, I know that. Why does it do that? I'm trying to make a threat
assessment here, captain.
CARTER
I don't know what it is, sir. But it's got a power source more
advanced then anything we've come across, including the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
It's a time capsule. Well, that's an educated guess, but imagine
your civilization is facing a major cataclysm. The end is coming,
you know it. Wouldn't you leave something behind? Something that
told everyone that came after you who you were.
TEAL'C
Or how you died.
DANIEL
Yes. Imagine what you could learn about your own fate.
TEAL'C
When a Goa'uld's world is taken by another in battle, he will
sometimes leave behind the means to destroy the conqueror.
O'NEILL
You think it might be a booby trap.
TEAL'C
Booby?
DANIEL
I don't think we're talking about the Goa'uld here. Whoever this
civilization was went through great pains to leave this artifact
behind. Like a message in a bottle.
O'NEILL
You buying this, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
The benefit may outweigh the risk.
CARTER
The earth sure could use a power source that lasts for thousands of
years.
O'NEILL
Alright. Pack it up. Let's go home.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
[Teal'c takes the artifact off the pedestal and places it in a
container on FRED. SG-1 turns and leaves down the corridor. The
artifact begins to glow.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--GATEROOM
[SG-1 arrives through the gate back to earth. Hammond and Simmons are
waiting at the bottom of the ramp.]
O'NEILL
We acquired the package, sir. I recommend level three precautions.
DAVIS
(over intercom)
Wormhole disengaged. Support teams go.
O'NEILL
Careful with it, it's heavy.
CARTER
Sir, start spectral analysis right away.
DANIEL
Oh, and input a detailed imaging of the outer surface into the
computer.
HAMMOND
Everything go as planned, Colonel?
O'NEILL
Oh, one small step one giant leap, that kind of stuff, sir.
HAMMOND
We'll debrief in one hour. Welcome home SG-1.
INT--LAB
[The artifact has been secured for analysis. Daniel and Carter are
working in the lab with Simmons overlooking in the control booth.]
CARTER
Well, we can add two more elements to the periodic table.Lieutenant,
I'd like to record this.
SIMMONS
Whatever you say, Captain.
CARTER
Try to relax Graham or its going to be a long day.
DANIEL
You know, I don't think it's the artifact he gets nervous like that
every time he's around you. Maybe a crush.
SIMMONS
Um, we're recording now.
CARTER
Thank you, Lieutenant.
[Simmons pauses, gives Carter an odd look before glancing back down at
the monitors.]
DANIEL
Oops. Hey, the artifact. Notice the writing.
[A computer screen with the alien language comes on screen.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond and SG-1 are debriefing on their latest trip through the
Stargate.]
DANIEL
So tiny it can be read by the naked eye.
HAMMOND
What does it say?
DANIEL
We think it's a set of instructions.
O'NEILL
On how to...?
DANIEL
Open it. We think it...uh, we think it opens. Well, I'm sure there's
much more to it than that. There's the equivalent of a thousand
pages of alien text on the exterior surface alone.
HAMMOND
What about the object's interior?
CARTER
We know very little. Fraiser is supervising positron emission
typography.
HAMMOND
You know I have the highest respect for your abilities. But the NID
wants a look at the thing.
O'NEILL
Well, I recommend against shipping the artifact anywhere just yet
General.
TEAL'C
Since Daniel Jackson's theory on the orb's function has yet to be
confirmed, it is best for it to remain in close proximity to the
Stargate. At least for the moment.
HAMMOND
You're scheduled to visit P4G-881.
DANIEL
Which is a primordial world with absolutely no civilization
whatsoever and therefore no need to bring along an archeologist.
HAMMOND
I'm willing to delay that mission for twenty four hours in order to
confirm your theory.
DANIEL
That's not enough time.
CARTER
But we'll take it. Thank you.
INT--LAB
[The artifact is hooked through a bunch of wires for observation.
Carter and Daniel are working with Simmons looking in from the control
room.]
CARTER
Okay, let's try another X-ray series. Y axis this time.
DANIEL
Sam.
CARTER
Yeah?
DANIEL
Okay. Up until now I've been sorta going on the assumption that this
is a sort of page one. It's relatively isolated from the other
groupings. Now I'm thinking it's numerical.
CARTER
Well, maybe the basis of their mathematics.
DANIEL
Right. That's what I thought. So if these smaller symbols would
represent exponents.
CARTER
So then this sequence grows exponential to become a very big number.
DANIEL
Right. And that is information I can't use.
[O'Neill walks into the room, quite chipper]
O'NEILL
Good morning campers! Sleep well? I did!
DANIEL
Oh, it can't be morning.
O'NEILL
Ah, but it is. We ship out at, oh, thirteen hundred hours.
DANIEL
Okay, Jack, talk to General Hammond.
O'NEILL
Nope. I want you both rested and ready to go. That's an order.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
DANIEL
Jack, come on.
O'NEILL
Daniel, SG-1 is a field until. You know that. Can't have it both
ways. When we get back you can...visit.
SIMMONS
We've got a spike. An EM spike across the Y band.
CARTER
What?
SIMMONS
Interior temperature is increasing forty degrees Fahrenheit.
O'NEILL
Captain?
CARTER
I don't know. I don't think we've done anything.
DANIEL
Maybe we woke it up.
SIMMONS
Sixty degrees.
CARTER
Radiation levels?
SIMMONS
Alpha particle radiation generation within the object's magnetic
field is increased four...six hundred percent.
CARTER
Sir, I recommend we return the artifact to P5C-353 now.
O'NEILL
Go tell them to start dialing. Go.
[Daniel leaves the room]
SIMMONS
One hundred degrees.
O'NEILL
Any idea what we're dealing with here?
CARTER
No, Sir.
[The artifact blossoms open in the middle and a violet-blue light began
to glow.]
O'NEILL
Well, I think we can rule out time capsule.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel rushes in.]
DANIEL
Start dialing P5C-353 right away.
HAMMOND
By whose order?
DANIEL
Colonel O'Neill's.
HAMMOND
Do it.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson?
DANIEL
It's the artifact, Sir. Something's wrong.
INT--LAB
[O'Neill and Carter are trying to remove the artifact from its brace.
Simmons is in the control room watching the status.]
SIMMONS
Temperature is still increasing. One hundred and ten degrees.
CARTER
We'll need to put our suits back on.
O'NEILL
No, There's not time for that. We'll just open the gate and throw it
back through. Teal'c, give me a hand here.
[Suddenly the artifact spews out spikes on the top part of the
hemisphere.]
O'NEILL
Whoa.
TEAL'C
It does not wish to be removed.
O'NEILL
That's too damn bad.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Davis is sitting in the control room as the Stargate dials the planet]
DAVIS
Chevron six encoded.
INT--SGC HALLWAY
[O'Neill and Teal'c are carrying the artifact through the corridors in
a full run. People flatten themselves against the walls as they run
past.]
O'NEILL
Out of the way, people!
INT--GATEROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c arrive with the artifact. The Stargate is still
dialing. Hammond, Carter, Daniel and Davis are in the control room.]
DAVIS
Chevron seven locked.
[The chevron locks. Another one of the artifact's spikes shoots out to
the floor. O'Neill and Teal'c jumps. More spikes project out.]
CARTER
Get out of there!
[A spike shoots towards Teal'c but he manages to swing out of the way.
Another spike comes out and goes through O'Neill's shoulder, dragging
him with it to the wall.]
O'NEILL
Ah! Oh god.
HAMMOND
Get security down there. Put the base on full alert.
CARTER
We need a medical team.
DAVIS
Security to the embarkation room. Medical team to the embarkation
room.
[Teal'c runs over to O'Neill. He tries to remove the spike. O'Neill
grabs Teal'c for support.]
O'NEILL
Kill it! God!
DAVIS
Sir, the umm, Stargate?
HAMMOND
Shut it down.
[The sphere is being held in place in front of the Stargate by five
spikes. Carter, Daniel, and Hammond run into the embarkation and
towards O'Neill.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[She takes a look at the spike holding him against the wall.]
CARTER
It's right through his shoulder into the concrete...
DANIEL
Oh my God.
HAMMOND
Get something to support his legs.
[Fraiser comes into the room and heads towards O'Neill. Simmons comes
in and takes measurements of the sphere.]
FRAISER
What can you tell me?
CARTER
I don't know but it's still hot. Be careful.
SIMMONS
Temperature is 133 and holding.
FRAISER
This wound is too clean. There should be blood. I don't know why
there wasn't more trauma.
O'NEILL
Where the hell is Teal'c?
FRAISER
It's gone right through the scapula. Colonel, why are
O'NEILL
Teal'c!
[Teal'c runs into the room with his staff weapon]
O'NEILL
Shoot it!
CARTER
Sir.
O'NEILL
Shoot it!
TEAL'C
I suggest you observe from the control room.
HAMMOND
Everybody out of here.
[Everyone starts to evacuate to the control room]
HAMMOND
Teal'c, fire when ready.
[The door to the gateroom closes. Simmons, Daniel, Carter, Fraiser and
Hammond all watch from the control room.]
CARTER
With respect General, this is a mistake.
HAMMOND
Why?
CARTER
We don't know how much of that staff energy will be transferred
through the object into the Colonel.
HAMMOND
Your objection is noted.
O'NEILL
Do it.
[Teal'c fires the staff into the sphere. The energy radiates out
through the spike, with some going into O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Again!
[Teal'c fires again and more energy goes through O'Neill. O'Neill
writhes in pain.]
O'NEILL
Ah! God.
SIMMONS
No change
CARTER
Sir, it just absorbed the energy.
TEAL'C
This weapon is ineffective. I shall try another.
CARTER
No! Sir, that staff energy had to have gone somewhere. We could be
feeding it what it wants for all we know.
HAMMOND
I want a cutting torch down there.
CARTER
If it's made of the same non-terrestrial alloys as the shell on the
orb itself, then it is several hundred times stronger then steel.
FRAISER
Sir, with your permission.
[Hammond nods and Fraiser heads out to tend to O'Neill.]
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, this is going to take some time.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is talking on the phone to NID personnel]
HAMMOND
I really don't give a damn what Colonel Mayborne has to say on the
subject. I've made my decision. Unless I'm ordered to do otherwise,
I'm not allowing anyone in or out of this facility until we can send
the damn thing back where it came from. No, General, thank you.
[Hammond hangs up the phone. Carter and Daniel are sitting across from
him.]
HAMMOND
The NID people want to see it.
CARTER
Even knowing what it's done to the Colonel?
DANIEL
Especially knowing what it's done to the Colonel.
HAMMOND
They're hoping we've found some kind of weapon we can one day use
against the Goa'uld. All I can tell them is what it isn't.
DANIEL
General, I don't know what to say. I wanted the artifact to be
something wonderful.
HAMMOND
You have nothing to apologize for, son. We've brought things back
from all over the galaxy. One just finally slap us in the face.
CARTER
We've managed to collect a significant amount of data before it hit
the fan, sir.
HAMMOND
Then I suggest you get to it. Dismissed.
[Daniel and Carter leave Hammond's office. Hammond picks up the red
phone.]
HAMMOND
This is Hammond. Lock up the mountain. Authorization code red dash
beta. Initiate Wild Fire.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN
[The gate to the mountain and doorways are being sealed and locked with
personnel running about.]
PA SYSTEM
Attention personnel. Level four quarantine is now in affect.
Switching to internal power and life support.
INT--GATEROOM
[Simmons is taking measurements and Sgt. Siler is working on cutting
the sphere. Fraiser, Daniel and Teal'c are standing around O'Neill who
is now seated on a ladder, still attached to the wall by a spike.]
O'NEILL
Hot.
Fraiser is readying an injection to give O'Neill.
FRAISER
I know. You have a very high fever which is being caused by an
infection. I'm going to give you a broad spectra antibiotic to help
fight it.
SIMMONS
The artifacts internal temperature just leveled off at 149 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[Teal'c walks over to Sgt. Siler who is using the blowtorch
ineffectively on the spike holding O'Neill.]
TEAL'C
Sergeant. Your progress here is unsatisfactory.
SILER
Can't go any faster, sir. This is the hardest stuff I've ever come
across.
TEAL'C
Then I will delay you no further.
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter and Daniel are standing talking to a group of people.]
CARTER
We're going to need everyone's help. Colonel O'Neill is alive but
obviously he is in trouble.
DANIEL
The data we managed to gather before this happened is all in the
base computer. It's not much but it's all we have. Use it.
CARTER
Don't rule anything out and don't make any assumptions.
DANIEL
I'll be leading the translation team.
CARTER
And we'll be working out of the astrophysics lab but we're all going
to have to work together on this one. Any questions?
CAPTAIN
So obviously we're dealing with a weapon.
CARTER
That's an assumption, Captain. All right. Let's get to work.
[Fraiser walks into the room and Carter approaches]
CARTER
How is he?
FRAISER
He's developed an infection. I've got him pumped full of antibiotics
which, amazingly, has seemed to slow it down its progress.
CARTER
Why is that amazing?
FRAISER
I think you should see this.
[Fraiser walks out of the room and Carter follows.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Fraiser come in from down the stairs. Simmons is sitting at
a terminal to their right.]
FRAISER
It's mobile like a bacteria but small like a virus and slightly
radioactive.
[Both Carter and Fraiser sit down at a computer terminal]
FRAISER
Definitely alien. And they also seem to bond in chains.
CARTER
And it's infected the Colonel?
FRAISER
This is why I wanted you to see it. I took this from a section of
Colonel O'Neill's uniform around his wound.
CARTER
What are you saying? It's infected his clothes as well as living
tissue?
FRAISER
And it's metabolizing the material as if it were living tissue. Like
a form of necrotizing fasciitis.
CARTER
Flesh eating disease? Okay. You said slightly radioactive?
FRAISER
Yeah.
CARTER
(to Simmons)
Lieutenant. We used ultraviolet when we were performing tests on the
iris' structural integrity.
SIMMONS
Right.
CARTER
Yeah.
[Simmons gets up and picks up the phone on the wall]
SIMMONS
Let's get some UV units in the gateroom.
CARTER
(on intercom in Gate room)
Teal'c, Colonel. It's just going to get a little dark in there for a
few seconds while we try something.
[Teal'c is standing with O'Neill who is hooked up to an IV unit.
Several people come in with the UV equipment. They are set up and the
lights turned off.]
SIMMONS
And bringing up the UV lights now.
FRAISER
Oh my god.
[The UV lights show a blueish tint running through the sphere, into and
on O'Neill and throughout the walls.]
CARTER
This is an even bigger problem then we thought.
SIMMONS
Captain Carter?
[Carter and Fraiser turn to look at Simmons. His hands are covered in
the blue and it is radiates up his arm.]
SIMMONS
What's happening to me?
INT--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Fraiser is readying an injection for Hammond while Carter debriefs
him]
CARTER
It can infect virtually any substance, even concrete.
HAMMOND
This entire complex is made of concrete.
CARTER
Worse then that, we've already determined it's got a taste for the
base wiring. Which means it's going to affect, or rather infect, our
computers and communication.
HAMMOND
Then, we need to kill it. How do we do that?
FRAISER
We've spread around the computer base main frame a sort of pesticide
but it hasn't even slowed the organism down.
HAMMOND
What was that you just gave me?
FRAISER
Tetracycline. It's kept the infection at bay in the Colonel and it
seems to work proactively with everyone I've been able to get a shot
into. But sir, I'll need more
HAMMOND
Absolutely not. A wildfire directive means nothing in or out, you
know that.
FRAISER
Sir, Lieutenant Simmons' infection is even more far gone than
Colonel O'Neill's but he's allergic to Tetracycline. None of the
alternatives I have on base
HAMMOND
Don't make me repeat myself Doctor.
FRAISER
With your permission, sir, I'd better get back to the infirmary.
[Hammond nods and Fraiser leaves, not too pleased with the situations]
HAMMOND
Captain.
CARTER
Sir?
HAMMOND
I need your honest assessment. Can we beat this thing?
CARTER
Like the Colonel always says: 'never give up', right? I'm not sure,
sir.
HAMMOND
Maybe it's time we considered evacuating personnel through the
Stargate.
CARTER
I thought of that...but to where? There's no guarantee we can stop
the organism from coming through the gate along with us. I don't
think we have the right to infect another world.
HAMMOND
Well, there are a number of uninhabited worlds we could gate
through. Albeit, most are uninhabited for good reason.
CARTER
Even if we could evacuate a number of survivors, practically every
one of us is infected by the organism to some degree. Without
antibiotics, we'd all be like Lieutenant Simmons right now. The
survivors would run out of supplies in a few days.
HAMMOND
At least they'd have that much time to find a solution.
CARTER
It's not worth the risk in my opinion, sir. We don't even know what
the orb would do if we tried to activate the Stargate again.
HAMMOND
Very well. We'll make our stand right here, Captain.
CARTER
Yes sir. They won't take us without a fight, sir.
HAMMOND
Damn right they won't.
[Hammond and Carter walk out]
INT--GATEROOM
[The walls and O'Neill are covered in blue even more then before. Sgt.
Siler is still working at burning through the spike. Teal'c is next to
O'Neill watching over him.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I am here, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
It's hot.
TEAL'C
The fever burns within you.
O'NEILL
You?
TEAL'C
The symbiote I carry appears to protect me.
O'NEILL
Way to go, Junior.
[Teal'c wipes the sweat from O'Neill's face]
TEAL'C
Doctor Fraiser will find a cure.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, you don't have to stick around.
TEAL'C
Undomesticated equines could not remove me.
O'NEILL
Wild horses, Teal'c, it's...that's a joke. You told a joke. Don't
make me laugh.
TEAL'C
Very well.
O'NEILL
You're a good man, my friend.
TEAL'C
As are you, my friend.
SIMMONS
Sir. I'm just about through here.
[The sphere seems to power up. Quickly the part where the torch was
cutting through jets farther into the wall and O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Ah! Teal'c!
TEAL'C
It will not allow us to free you, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(crying in pain)
God...God help.
INT--LAB
[Daniel and Carter are perched over a enlarged copy of the writing on
the sphere.]
DANIEL
Alright. Presuming this is page one and presuming this sequence is
some kind of whole numbers that represents exponential growth...what
does that mean?
CARTER
Well, it could represent the growth pattern of the alien organism.
So far its spread has followed an exponential curve.
DANIEL
Alright. So, from that we can extrapolate that it is a warning. This
organism will continue to grow and expand exponential until...what?
Until we die? I mean, if that's what it says, what's the point of
saying it?
CARTER
Try turning the page. Maybe the answer is there.
DANIEL
Right.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Simmons is lying in bed obviously sick, with Fraiser taking care of
him.]
FRAISER
How's the pain?
SIMMONS
It's not too bad.
FRAISER
Well, I'm going to give you something for it anyway.
SIMMONS
Hey. If you see Captain Carter...
FRAISER
Tell you what Lieutenant, she has to come down in a couple of hours
for her booster so I'll make sure I send her over.
INT--LAB
[Carter is sitting at a computer terminal working. The Captain is
working behind her.]
CARTER
I was right. Teal'c's staff blast gave it the energy it needed to
spread like this. It's reproducing because we fed it. Damn. Why did
I let them do that?
CAPTAIN
Okay, so it feeds on energy. How do we use that? It feeds on
everything.
CARTER
Have the CO2 levels gone up?
CAPTAIN
Yeah, but the scrubbers are handling it.
CARTER
Like fire. Add energy a fire burns hotter. Add fuel it burns longer
but it can't live without one thing.
CAPTAIN
Oxygen.
CARTER
Yes.
CAPTAIN
We can't either.
CARTER
Yeah, but at least we can slow it down.
[The computer screens start to go haywire]
CAPTAIN
What's happening?
CARTER
It's gotten into our computers. Keep working.
[Carter gets up and leaves down a hallway.]
WORKER
Can't come this way, Captain, it's eating through steam pipes.
[Carter turns and heads into an elevator. The elevator stops between
levels. Carter begins to bang on the doors.]
CARTER
Hello? Somebody!
[Daniel is walking nearby and hears her yelling]
DANIEL
Hello?
CARTER
Somebody!
DANIEL
Hello?
CARTER
Daniel! I'm stuck in here. Get the doors open.
[Daniel walks over to the wall where an axe is located and uses it to
pry open the doors.]
CARTER
Hurry up. It's eating through the control panel.
[Daniel and Carter pull and finally get the doors fully open]
DANIEL
Sam!
CARTER
I'm okay. I'll explain later.
INT--GATEROOM
[Teal'c is using the blowtorch to keep the organism from spreading
farther. O'Neill is still attached to the wall. Hammond is in the
control room when Carter and Daniel walk in.]
CARTER
General, sir. I have something. What is he doing?
HAMMOND
Teal'c is trying to stop the spread of the organism at the source.
CARTER
Tell him to stop.
HAMMOND
Why? It seems to be working.
CARTER
Only because the fire is temporarily consuming the oxygen in the
room. It feeds on energy. Sir, I'm asking you to trust me.
HAMMOND
(over intercom)
Teal'c, stand down. We're going to try another approach.
[Teal'c shuts off the blowtorch]
CARTER
Okay. The organism needs oxygen to reproduce. Now since we are on
internal life support we can adjust the CO2 scrubbers and lower the
oxygen levels.
HAMMOND
How low are we talking?
CARTER
We'll start at 8%, but we'll have to start now.
[Hammond turns to a guard standing behind him.]
HAMMOND
Do it.
DAVIS
General Hammond, sir. I think you should see this.
The computer screen show "WILDFIRE INITIATED"
COMPUTER VOICE
Autoself destruct has been initiated
DAVIS
I didn't touch a thing. This self destruct countdown started on its
own.
CARTER
General?
HAMMOND
In the event of containment failure, Wildfire kicks in
automatically.
CARTER
Sir, we have to deactivate the auto destruct.
HAMMOND
We have a responsibility to make sure the organism doesn't leave the
mountain, Captain.
CARTER
With all due respect, sir, I don't think you understand. It could
feed from the energy of the staff blast, how far do you think it
will spread if the autodestruct goes off?
HAMMOND
I need two officers to override.
[Hammond and Carter both type their passwords into the computer to shut
the program down.]
CARTER
The organism has invaded our computers. It won't recognize our
codes.
HAMMOND
The devices' internal clock has been activated. We can't stop it
without the computer.
CARTER
Well then, in just under three hours the organism will be fed enough
energy to spread across the face of the earth.
INT--GATEROOM
[O'Neill is still hanging from the spike attached to the wall. Teal'c
is with him.]
O'NEILL
I blew it. I screwed up.
TEAL'C
I also believed we should retrieve the object.
O'NEILL
It was my decision.
TEAL'C
If we are to met the challenge of the Goa'uld, and further your
race, risks must be taken. Your decision was correct.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Carter is being given a shot by Fraiser.]
FRAISER
You idea seems to be working
CARTER
Yeah, seems to have slowed the progress of the organism by 90%.
FRAISER
Well, don't jump up and down or you'll get my other patients all
excited.
CARTER
Even in a completely anaerobic environment, the organism just goes
dormant. All we've done is buy ourselves some time before...I've got
to get back to work.
FRAISER
Well, before you do, if you wouldn't mind stopping by to see
Simmons.
CARTER
How's he doing?
[Carter walks over to where Simmons is lying, not looking well.]
CARTER
Graham?
SIMMONS
Captain Carter.
CARTER
We're fighting this thing, Graham. You just got to hang in there,
okay?
SIMMONS
Before I...I just wanted to say, how much...how I'm doin so far?
CARTER
You're doing just fine.
[Simmons closes his eyes and Carter leaves the room.]
INT--LAB
[Daniel is in the control room. He appears drained. There are other
personnel in the room working on the monitors. None of them notices one
of the computer screens begin to flicker. But Daniel notices. He puts
on his glasses and takes another look.]
DANIEL
Come here
CAPTAIN
Who?
DANIEL
Anybody...just come here.
[The Captain comes and looks over Daniel's shoulder at the screen.]
DANIEL
Look at this. Wait for it. There.
[A symbol appears on the screen before it disappears again.]
CAPTAIN
That symbol is on the artifact.
DANIEL
Yes, it is. It's trying to communicate with us.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Carter, Hammond and Daniel are standing in the room discussing the
recent events.]
DANIEL
I think what we thought was gibberish on all the computers was
actually the aliens attempt to communicate with us.
CARTER
Maybe. But the symbols you're seeing could also be from the random
files of our research.
DANIEL
No, that's impossible. See, I didn't start working on this sequence
until after the computers went down.
HAMMOND
Assuming you're right, what are they trying to communicate?
DANIEL
Well, they could be saying take me to your leader for all I know. I
have no idea. The point is, they are trying. We haven't even
considered what we're up against here is an alien intelligence.
We've treated it like a disease, like a plague. Not once have we
stopped to listen.
HAMMOND
How do we do that?
CARTER
We let it grow.
HAMMOND
What?
CARTER
We increase the oxygen levels even higher then normal. We hit it
with another staff weapon blast. We let it do what it's been trying
to do.
HAMMOND
The exact opposite of the advice you've been giving me up until now.
Which is it, Captain?
CARTER
Sir, we both know what will happen if we don't try something.
INT--GATEROOM
[Hammond, Carter and Daniel walk in to see O'Neill and Teal'c still
waiting for the next move. They walk towards the orb.]
CARTER
Fraiser says the organism bonds together in chains. What if it's
only capable of expressing that intelligence once it hits critical
mass?
DANIEL
Even if you're right and we let it take over the computers, it's
going to be communicating in a language that I can't translate
without a point of reference.
CARTER
Maybe Colonel O'Neill didn't just get in the way. Fraiser said there
was no blood. There was practically no trauma around that wound.
With the force that struck him, it's just not possible.
DANIEL
Unless it did it on purpose.
CARTER
Yes! We have to cut off his medication, sir.
HAMMOND
Are you out of your mind?
TEAL'C
If you do so, O'Neill will die.
CARTER
He'd want us to try this...I know it.
DANIEL
Communicate with the organism through Jack?
CARTER
Yes. I think that's what it has been trying to do all along.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Davis is looking over the gate room checking on readings. O'Neill and
the walls are covered more than ever with the alien entity.]
DAVIS
Oxygen level 30% above normal.
INT--GATEROOM
CARTER
Sir? Sir, I don't know if what we are about to try is a good idea or
not, but you have the right to know. You might not survive it.
[Carter holds O'Neill's hand. He gives it a squeeze. She pulls out the
IV to stop the medication. She backs up and joins Hammond and Teal'c
behind the orb.]
CARTER
Okay, Teal'c.
[Teal'c raises his staff to fire at the orb. He fires and the energy
goes through and O'Neill is shocked.]
CARTER
Again.
[Teal'c shoots and again the energy is absorbed.]
CARTER
We have to. Again.
[Teal'c fires the third shot and Carter runs to check on O'Neill.]
CARTER
No pulse.
[A few seconds later O'Neill's head comes up.]
O'NEILL/ALIEN
Good morning, campers.
[O'Neill's voice sounds different and his speech is slower. Hammond
walks over to him.]
O'NEILL/ALIEN
This is truly a strange feeling.
CARTER
Colonel?
O'NEILL/ALIEN
Yes, he is here.
HAMMOND
Who else we are talking too?
O'NEILL/ALIEN
We are also here.
HAMMOND
My name is...
O'NEILL/ALIEN
Hammond, yes. O'Neill knows.
HAMMOND
Then you should also know we mean you no harm.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
You awoke us.
HAMMOND
We have only recently become aware of your existence.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
You would have returned us to our former world.
TEAL'C
We believed you were a threat to us.
DANIEL
We feared you.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
And your fear would have destroyed us. Millennia ago our world was
dying. We could no longer live there. For this reason, we created
the orb.
DANIEL
Where you slept for a hundred thousand years.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
Yes, Daniel.
DANIEL
Waiting for someone to come along, like us, and take you through the
Stargate.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
So it was written on the orb. Once exposed to the atmosphere of a
living world, we went forth
DANIEL
And multiplied.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
So it was written.
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct in four minutes.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
We can not go back.
HAMMOND
We can not allow you to stay.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
O'Neill feels this as well. However, you have allowed us no
alternatives.
CARTER
General, we're almost out of time.
HAMMOND
This place, admittedly out of our ignorance, is about to be
destroyed by an explosion.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
Such energy only serves to nourish us. We will multiple and consume
your world.
HAMMOND
If you would allow us to restore our communications, we could stop
that from happening. We would survive.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
O'Neill desires this as well. He wishes to live. But what of us?
DANIEL
P4G-881! It's primordial, lots of oxygen and sunlight. Like this
world was a quarter of a billion years ago.
CARTER
Sir, we can't open the Stargate without the computers.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
You would send us there? Through your Stargate?
HAMMOND
We would.
O'NEILL/ALIEN
For what reason?
HAMMOND
So that we both may survive.
[O'Neill's head falls back with a little gasp.]
DANIEL
We'll take you there ourselves, Please!
[All the power is lost in the control room.]
DAVIS
Everything just shut down!
HAMMOND
God help us.
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct in two minutes.
The computers start to light back up again.
DAVIS
Sir, Sir...I think the computers are rebooting!
HAMMOND
Start dialing P4G-881 as soon as they are up.
DAVIS
Yes, sir.
[Carter and Hammond run into the control room as the stargate starts to
dial.]
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct in one minute and thirty seconds.
[O'Neill's head comes back up.]
DAVIS
Chevron one engaged.
[The spike starts to remove itself from the wall and O'Neill.]
DAVIS
Chevron two engaged.
[O'Neill stands up]
DAVIS
Chevron three engaged.
[O'Neill steps down the ladder]
DAVIS
Chevron four engaged.
[O'Neill walks to the orb.]
DAVIS
Chevron five engaged.
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct in one minute.
[O'Neill places his hands on the orb and it starts to glow.]
DAVIS
Chevron six engaged.
[The orb continues to glow and the alien organism starts to retract
into the orb along with the spikes.]
DAVIS
Chevron seven locked.
[O'Neill walks up the ramp with the orb in his hand]
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct in thirty seconds.
[O'Neill pushes the orb through the event horizon.]
PA SYSTEM
Twenty seconds.
[O'Neill collapses onto the ramp.]
PA SYSTEM
Ten. Nine.
[The Stargate disengages and Hammond and Carter start to type.]
PA SYSTEM
Four. Three. Two. One.
[Both codes were entered.]
PA SYSTEM
Autoself destruct aborted
[Carter runs to where Teal'c and Daniel are already with O'Neill at the
ramp, helping him sit up.]
O'NEILL
Nice work.
TEAL'C
It is good to see you alive and well.
DANIEL
Welcome back, Jack.
CARTER
Thought you were gone for good, sir.
O'NEILL
Wild horses, Captain.
[The three of them help O'Neill walk down the ramp.]
