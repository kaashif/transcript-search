INT--GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is turning.]
DAVIS
Incoming traveler, incoming traveler.
MAN
Clear the ramp.
DAVIS
Offworld activation. Closing the iris.
HAMMOND
There's no one scheduled to come back for 24 hours. Who is it?
DAVIS
It's SG-1's remote access code, Sir.
HAMMOND
What? They just went through!
DAVIS
Opening the iris; stand by.
[The iris opens, the wormhole flickers.]
DAVIS
Sir, the Gate is showing twice the power as normal, and it's
increasing!
[DANIEL comes flying through the Gate; HAMMOND jumps to avoid being
hit, then rushes to his side and turns him over. DANIEL is unconscious.
TEAL'C flies through the Gate and rolls, coming to a stop at the base
of the ramp.]
DAVIS
System overload!
[All over the Gate room, things start exploding or throwing off
sparks.]
DAVIS
The wormhole is disengaged!
HAMMOND
Get a medical team in here now! Teal'c, are you all right?
TEAL'C
I am.
HAMMOND
Where are Colonel O'Neill and Captain Carter?
TEAL'C
(Looks around)
They could not have been more than two metres behind. I do not know.
[HAMMOND helps him up.]
INT--ICE CAVERN
[We see another Stargate. Behind it, the wormhole has punched a hole
through dense ice. O'NEILL is lying on the ground, unconscious. As we
see her, CARTER gets up and takes off her helmet. Where are they?]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--STARGATE COMMAND--INFIRMARY
[DANIEL is lying in a bed, unconscious. TEAL'C is seated on an
examination table, his arm in a sling.]
HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson's still unconscious but Doctor Warner thinks he'll be
all right. I need to know what went on back there Teal'c.
TEALC
We were under fire. Distant. Energy weapons of some kind. Possibly
Goa'uld technology.
HAMMOND
So it's possible Colonel O'Neill and Captain Carter were struck by
enemy fire?
TEALC
I do not believe so. They were but a few metres behind me as we
passed through the Stargate.
HAMMOND
How many hostiles were there?
TEALC
They were some distance away. But we appeared to be surrounded. We
were there only moments. Colonel O'Neill ordered us to lay down
cover fire while Daniel Jackson dialed home. General Hammond, I
believe they should have made it through the 'Gate. I do not
understand why they did not.
[DAVIS walks into the room.]
DAVIS
Preliminary report on the Stargate repairs, Sir.
(He hands over a clipboard)
TEAL'C
Repairs?
HAMMOND
There was some kind of overload during transit, we don't know why.
TEAL'C
I must return immediately.
HAMMOND
(Pushes Teal'c down)
Not with an army waiting on the other side. Sorry.
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I suggest a second probe be sent through.
HAMMOND
As soon as the Stargate's working again we'll do just that.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[O'NEILL is trying to get up.]
O'NEILL
(Putting hands to his head)
Oh my God. Aargh, eurgh.
CARTER
Colonel...
O'NEILL
Carter...
CARTER
Yeah, uh...Try to stay put Sir, I think your leg's broken.
O'NEILL
No, my leg's definitely broken. What's the bad news, 'cause unless
they've redecorated the Gate room I don't think we're in Kansas
anymore.
CARTER
Daniel must have misdialed.
O'NEILL
Misdialed? You mean this place is a wrong number? Ah, for crying out
loud. Where is he?
CARTER
He's not here, Sir. Neither is Teal'c.
O'NEILL
No, he has to be.
(He moves to use his radio)
CARTER
I tried that. You've been unconscious for nearly two hours.
O'NEILL
They came through the Gate before we did.
CARTER
I know that, I also know that we're alone here, wherever here is.
O'NEILL
Ice. Nice.
CARTER
Yeah, I think we're inside a deep crevasse of a glacier. If their
Stargate's been overrun by ice, possibly on a planet in the middle
of an ice age. Now, there is some light filtering through up there
and there are some fissures in the ice, but all of them are too
narrow to follow very far. We're in trouble, Sir.
O'NEILL
Oh, nonsense. We'll just dial home and straighten all this out.
(He looks around)
Where's the DHD?
CARTER
Can't find that either.
O'NEILL
Oh, so, uh, we're in trouble.
CARTER
We're in trouble.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[A technician is welding something on the Gate. TEAL'C and DAVIS are
surveying the workers. HAMMOND walks in.]
DAVIS
We've almost replaced all the super conductive interface elements,
Sir. The old ones all melted. It's going to take some time to load
test them though.
HAMMOND
Just tell me the minute we can send a probe through.
SILER
That'll be 24 hours General, minimum.
TEAL'C
Captain Carter and Colonel O'Neill do not have that long.
HAMMOND
I'll give you half that.
SILER
No Sir, it doesn't work that way. 24 hours is the best I can do.
HAMMOND
Then you'd better get back to it.
SILER
Yes Sir! Come on, let's go.
HAMMOND looks up at the Gate.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[In the icy place, CARTER is setting O'NEILL'S leg.]
O'NEILL
Aargh! Oh, God.... Ah.
(He makes more noise. Obviously, he's in pain.)
CARTER
Okay, I think it's set.
O'NEILL
You THINK it's set?
CARTER
I'm positive. All we have to do is put a splint on it and you'll be
as good as new.
O'NEILL
(grunts)
Just take it easy, Doctor.
CARTER
Wrong kind of doctor, I'm afraid.
O'NEILL
You wouldn't think jagged bone digging into raw nerves would hurt,
but it does.
CARTER
Sorry Sir, but I've never done this before in my life. Is this your
first broken bone?
O'NEILL
Ah, ah, no. This...this would be, uh, nine, if you count skull
fractures.
CARTER
How did you manage that?
O'NEILL
Little parachuting mishap, over the borders of Iran and Iraq, back
in...eighty...uh....
CARTER
Okay, this is going to hurt, Sir.
O'NEILL
Ah! I know, I know, I know, I know.
CARTER
So, what happened?
O'NEILL
I hit the ground. Go figure. Ah! God...ah.... My chute opened a
little late, and it hurt, just like that.
CARTER
I'm sorry Colonel, I'm doing the best I can.
O'NEILL
I know you are, Captain, can you just be done?
CARTER
So you hit the ground, and...?
O'NEILL
And they all lived happily ever after.
CARTER
Almost there, almost...
O'NEILL
No, you're there Captain, you're there. That's a great splint. Stop!
Stop...ah...
CARTER
So, how long before you were rescued?
O'NEILL
No rescue.
(Carter looks at him, shocked)
It wasn't exactly...an official...mission, if you know what I mean.
So I had to make it out on my own. Nine days.
CARTER
Wow, what got you through it?
O'NEILL
Sara...
CARTER
Your wife.
O'NEILL
At the time. I needed to see her again. You tallied our supplies
yet?
CARTER
Yes, Sir. Supplies for three days, but we can stretch that. We've
got a little drinking water, but...
(she raises her hand, gesturing upward)
O'NEILL
Ice melts.
CARTER
Yeah, and we've got our field cooking gear to melt it. The
flashlight batteries are going to be a problem. We've got thermal
blankets.
O'NEILL
That's cool. By the way, Captain, we ARE going to get out of here;
that's an order.
CARTER
How's the splint feel?
O'NEILL
Captain? You have to believe me.
CARTER
I want to, Sir. I just don't see how.
O'NEILL
Then we'd better start looking for a way. Because I'll be damned if
I'm going to die on some god-forsaken block of ice a million light
years from home. Is that clear?
CARTER
Yes Sir.
O'NEILL
Good. Help me up.
CARTER
Ah, ah, I don't think you should move.
O'NEILL
Probably not, but my butt's freezing to the ground. Come on.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[CARTER helps him up. O'NEILL stands, his arm across CARTER'S
shoulders. They look around the cavern.]
O'NEILL
Ah, a little paint, a coupla windows, maybe a fireplace in the
corner...it'll be just like home.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[DANIEL'S eyelids flicker and then open. TEAL'C comes into focus.]
DANIEL
Teal'c?
TEAL'C
The Stargate has malfunctioned. We came back through the Gate at too
great a velocity.
DANIEL
Jack and Sam?
TEAL'C
They did not follow.
DANIEL
Yes they did. I know they did. They were right behind us. That
doesn't make any sense.
TEAL'C
I concur. In a few hours a probe will be sent back in an attempt to
determine their fate.
INT--ICE CAVERN
O'NEILL
We might be able to climb out of here. You might, anyway.
CARTER
What?
O'NEILL
I said, you might be able to climb outta here.
CARTER
Colonel, I've found it!
[CARTER is sitting on what looks to be a boulder, chipping at the ice.]
O'NEILL
Found what?
CARTER
The DHD. I figured the glacial flow must have separated the Stargate
from its Dial Home Device, but it looks like it might be intact.
(She sweeps snow away)
O'NEILL
(Pulling himself up over the edge of the ice block)
Ah, God. Oh.
(He stops and rests for a moment, waiting for the pain to pass.)
Can we dig it out?
CARTER
Even if it doesn't work, we can use the chopped ice to melt drinking
water.
O'NEILL
All right.
[CARTER starts chipping away but stops--O'NEILL is clasping his chest.]
CARTER
What's wrong with your chest?
O'NEILL
I think I cracked a rib too.
CARTER
Why didn't you say something?
O'NEILL
I was afraid you'd try to put a splint on it. I'll be fine.
CARTER
I've been thinking about where Daniel and Teal'c might be.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
[O'NEILL gets his knife out and joins in chipping at the ice.]
CARTER
So far, I count three possible explanations. One, Daniel misdialed
and they're here. Somewhere we haven't found.
O'NEILL
I don't see 'em.
CARTER
Right. Two, Daniel didn't misdial but for some reason the Stargate
malfunctioned during transit. Don't ask me how, I haven't figured
that part out yet. Anyway, they got sent back to Earth, but for some
reason we got sent here.
O'NEILL
What's three?
CARTER
Three. The Stargate malfunctioned. We got sent to this planet,
Daniel and Teal'c got sent to another one.
O'NEILL
What's four?
CARTER
There is no four.
O'NEILL
It's after three.
CARTER
Not this time, Colonel.
O'NEILL
All right, we'll assume they made it back to Earth. They'll start
sending search parties.
CARTER
To where?
O'NEILL
Here, I hope.
CARTER
Where would they begin? They have no idea where we are. With all the
possible Stargates a random search could easily take...ten years!
O'NEILL
Not if they look here first.
CARTER
Even if all SG teams started searching right now, the mathematical
probability of them even...
O'NEILL
Captain!
CARTER
I think too much.
[O'NEILL nods. They resume chipping.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
SILER
Charging circuit MX-43 at 20%.
TECHNICIAN
20%, sir.
SILER
One hundred. Circuit is holding, reset and standby. She's all yours,
General.
HAMMOND
Well done, Sergeant. You heard the man.
DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
[SG-3 stand at the Gate, armed and waiting.]
DAVIS
Chevron one encoded.
TEAL'C
SG-3 and I are ready and awaiting your orders, General.
HAMMOND
I won't authorize this rescue mission unless the probe sends back
the right pictures, Teal'c.
DAVIS
Chevron two encoded.
HAMMOND
All defense teams stay alert. These hostiles might have both our
addresses and our transmitter code.
DAVIS
Chevron three encoded.
DANIEL
You don't actually think they'd give up the transmitter codes to the
enemy, do you?
HAMMOND
Not willingly, no.
DAVIS
Chevron four encoded.
TEAL'C
I do not believe they would do so, even under the duress of torture.
DAVIS
Chevron five encoded.
HAMMOND
Teal'c, in the event we find no enemy activity on the other side,
you will coordinate with Major Castleman on the rescue mission.
DAVIS
Chevron six encoded.
TEAL'C
I understand.
DAVIS
Chevron seven is locked.
[The wormhole engages. A MALP is sent through the Stargate.]
DAVIS
The probe should reach the Stargate at P4A-771 in five seconds.
Four, three, two, now.
[The picture transmitted shows no sign of life, only another MALP.]
DANIEL
No sign of Jack and Sam, but no evidence they got into a firefight
either.
[There are flashes, and energy weapons shoot at the MALP.]
HAMMOND
What are you waiting for? Close the iris! Disengage the Stargate.
SG-3 stand down. The rescue mission is scrubbed.
DANIEL
General!
[DANIEL and TEAL'C stare at the screen, which displays "transmission
interrupt".]
INT--ICE CAVERN
[O'NEILL is heating something in a pot over a fire. CARTER is still
chipping at the DHD.]
O'NEILL
Soup's on.
(He pours the liquid into two cups.)
CARTER
Just a little more, I'm almost through.
O'NEILL
Come on now. You don't want it to get cold.
CARTER
(Approaching)
Ah. I didn't know you could cook.
O'NEILL
I can't, but my melted ice is to die for.
CARTER
Thank you. Sir, maybe I should have another look at you.
O'NEILL
No, I'm fine. Eat.
CARTER
(Eats some soup)
I've, uh, been thinking about how the Stargate might have
malfunctioned.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
CARTER
Well, we don't totally understand how it works; but the theory we
have so far is that the Gate creates an artificial wormhole, that
somehow transfers an energized matter stream in one direction along
an extra-dimensional conduit. I think the matter stream between
Stargates got redirected, kind of like a...a lightning bolt jumping
from one point to another in mid-strike. Now, I figure it had to
have been the attack on P4A-771. The Gate itself was probably struck
by enough energy during the firefight to influence the direction of
the matter stream before we reached the other side. Colonel?
O'NEILL
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
CARTER
What I'm saying is, we must have emerged through a Stargate
relatively close to Earth in the Gate network. Somewhere between
P4A-771 and Earth. Now, if the SG rescue teams reach the same
conclusion, it could significantly narrow their search.
O'NEILL
That's good news.
CARTER
Yeah.
[O'NEILL is panting; not looking good. CARTER observes him with
concern.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[DANIEL is looking at the glass map showing the planets.]
DANIEL
Okay. So if they're not there...
(points)
and they are not here...
(points)
TEAL'C
It is possible that they may have perished within the wormhole.
DANIEL
Yeah. In which case they're gone. I know. I thought of that. But if
they are alive, if there's the least remote possibility that this
malfunction sent them to a different Stargate...
TEAL'C
Was it not Captain Carter who deduced the possible combinations of
Stargate symbols numbered in the millions?
DANIEL
(nods)
Yeah.
(Stares at map.)
Well, we have to narrow it down.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER and O'NEILL are still chipping at the ice block. The red center
of the DHD is exposed.]
CARTER
Whoa.
(She scrapes the chipped ice away)
Colonel.
[CARTER pushes chipped ice aside, revealing a hand with a Jaffa
gauntlet on it, still under the ice.]
CARTER
A serpent guard.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
CARTER
I guess he didn't make it.
O'NEILL
Ya think?
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[DANIEL is pointing at the glass map.]
DANIEL
Okay, this is P4A-771, this is Earth. Now, the Stargate shut itself
down just after Teal'c and I came through.
HAMMOND
There was an energy surge.
DANIEL
Right. But what would that have done to the wormhole itself?
SILER
I have no idea.
DANIEL
Could it just disappear?
SILER
No, I don't think so, Sir. It would have to discharge somewhere.
DANIEL
Like...another Stargate?
SILER
Yeah, maybe.
(Turns to Hammond)
Sir, it's all theoretical, but we think that Stargates are basically
giant superconductors. Charged matter streams along lines of force
between them.
DANIEL
Positive to negative, like electricity. Right?
SILER
Except for the fact the whole trip happens outside our dimension;
yeah, more or less.
DANIEL
Okay, what if it jumped. Redirected itself here, or here,
(points to destinations on map)
or anywhere along...here.
(Daniel spreads his hand and slides it over the planets between
Earth and P4A-771.)
HAMMOND
You're suggesting we search all these worlds?
DANIEL
Well, at least we've narrowed an entire galaxy of Stargates down to
a handful of possibilities.
HAMMOND
Assuming you're right, why haven't they used that Stargate to come
back on their own?
DANIEL
Teal'c and I were flung out of this Gate at this end so fast I don't
even remember hitting the ramp. Now, they could be badly hurt, in
which case we will not have to search far from the Stargates
themselves. I think we owe it to them to try.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER and O'NEILL have uncovered the top of the DHD.]
O'NEILL
You IDed the seventh symbol yet?
CARTER
Yeah, this one has to be the point of origin. I've never seen it
before.
(She looks down)
No...the batteries...Guess it's now or never.
O'NEILL
I've always preferred now...to never.
[He coughs, spitting up blood. Carter winces.]
CARTER
Here goes.
[CARTER dials. The chevrons flicker and come on slowly...1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6...the seventh chevron doesn't engage; they all fade out.]
CARTER
Dammit! Damn!
O'NEILL
Did you dial the right address?
CARTER
Yes! It has to be something as simple as the control interface. If
we just can dig down to the panel on the DHD, I can fix it.
O'NEILL
Negative.
CARTER
Sir, we got to keep trying!
O'NEILL
Of course we do. But we've been awake...for a very long time. It'll
be there in the morning.
(He crumples up in agony)
God...
CARTER
What about you?
O'NEILL
I told you we're going to get out of here. It's just going to take
longer than we thought.
CARTER
(Nods)
Yes Sir.
(She sounds unconvinced)
O'NEILL
Captain...?
CARTER
(Nods)
Yes Sir.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[DANIEL sticks another Post-It note onto the glass map. HAMMOND enters
the room.]
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson?
DANIEL
We just received probe telemetry from P5C-11 and 12, neither of them
have a breathable atmosphere any more. If they ever did.
HAMMOND
I have formally reported Colonel O'Neill and Captain Carter as
missing in action.
DANIEL
(Demanding)
Why?
HAMMOND
Missing in action doesn't mean we stop looking, son.
[HAMMOND leaves, and DANIEL turns to look at the map once more.]
DANIEL
Missing. I'm missing something.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER and O'NEILL are lying together on the icy ground, CARTER
resting her head on O'NEILL's chest. O'NEILL coughs.]
O'NEILL
Oh God. Captain.
(CARTER raises her head.)
As much as I might...otherwise think this is nice...
CARTER
Sshhh. Try to sleep.
O'NEILL
Is that what we're doing?
CARTER
You're exhausted; you passed out. I just thought we had to combine
body heat or we wouldn't make it through the night.
O'NEILL
That's fine. It's just...very hard to sleep...with broken ribs when
someone's lying on you.
CARTER
Sorry.
(She moves slightly, so that her head is on his arm, not his chest.)
Sorry, sorry.
O'NEILL
That's better.
CARTER
Sleep for a few hours and I'll fix the DHD.
O'NEILL
Okay. Night.
CARTER
Night.
(They're silent for a moment.)
Oh...Colonel?
O'NEILL
It's my sidearm, I swear...
[CARTER giggles.]
O'NEILL
No giggling, please...
CARTER
If we don't make it, I won't have any regrets. You?
O'NEILL
I'll regret...dying.
INT--SGC CONTROL AND BRIEFING ROOMS
[DANIEL is walking around with a mug of coffee. He stops and stares at
the Stargate. Upstairs, HAMMOND is equally pensive. In the Gate room,
DAVIS watches another team return.]
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER is getting really annoyed with the DHD.]
CARTER
God, why won't you work!
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Carter. Carter...
CARTER
Colonel!
(She leaps off of the ice block. In her hurry, she loses her balance
and slides to the ground.)
Ow. Sir?
O'NEILL
I'm usually the first one up.
CARTER
You're bleeding internally; I don't know how badly. Your broken leg
may already be frostbitten, I can't tell. I've been trying to warm
it up with the last of our cooking sterno but that's about had it.
O'NEILL
What's the bad news?
(Carter looks away, hiding her emotions.)
Help me up.
CARTER
No, Sir. You need to heal. That's an order.
O'NEILL
I give the orders around here.
CARTER
Doctor's orders.
(She takes a pot of water off of the stove)
I want you to drink as much of this as you can. Once that sterno
dies, we won't be able to thaw any more.
(She holds the pot to O'Neill's lips)
I should have gotten you out of here by now. I'm sorry.
O'NEILL
You will, you will.
CARTER
I have been working on the control panel for the last twelve hours.
It just...I don't know why it won't work.
(her voice breaks)
It should work! I--I'm missing something.
O'NEILL
Captain.
CARTER
Sir?
O'NEILL
It's time to go to plan B.
CARTER
What would plan B be?
O'NEILL
You...you take the rest of the supplies and climb out of here. Take
your chances up on the planet. Head towards daylight.
CARTER
If I can't get that Stargate to work; we will BOTH go.
O'NEILL
Right, I'll race you. All right, Captain, make it work.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[There's an incoming traveler in the SGC--TEAL'C steps through the
Stargate with an injured man slung over his shoulders.]
TEAL'C
Major Castleman requires medical attention.
DAVIS
Medical team to the embarkation room!
(to a technician)
Put the iris on safe.
SOLDIER
Come on, let's go.
HAMMOND
What happened?
TEAL'C
We were exploring a cave not far from the Stargate. He fell several
metres from a rock ledge. There was no sign of Captain Carter or
Colonel O'Neill.
HAMMOND
Are you all right?
TEALC
I am ready to embark again.
HAMMOND
I'm calling the search off.
DANIEL
What?
HAMMOND
This was the last of the planets to fit your theory, Doctor.
DANIEL
W...w...well, it's been, what, a few days? I mean, what if we stop
just short of finding them?
HAMMOND
I'm sorry!
[HAMMOND stomps out of the room. DANIEL and TEAL'C stare after him,
dismay clear on their faces.]
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER is still trying to repair the DHD.]
CARTER
Okay, energy converger intact. Oh God--reset! Reset! Why didn't I
think! Colonel, I'm going to interrupt the power. I'm going to shut
it all off and turn it on again! Okay, this better work.
(She fiddles inside the panel, then sticks her knife in the ice)
Okay, okay...
[CARTER dials, the chevrons glow. She gets partway through the address,
and the ground begins to shake. Pieces of ice fall around her.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[DANIEL is still in the room with the glass map. A glass full of water
starts to rattle, the water in it slopping around. DANIEL stares at the
glass, then walks over to look down at the Stargate. Some of the
chevrons are lit.]
INT--ICE CAVE
[CARTER looks despairingly at the Stargate. She puts her hand on the
center crystal; the light in the chevrons dies.]
CARTER
Work, ah...work...
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[DANIEL is staring at the glass of water and a pitcher; the water is
still moving slightly. TEAL'C walks in.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Teal'c. Did you see that?
[TEAL'C stares at the water, looks at the Stargate, and then frowns at
DANIEL.]
TEAL'C
Why are you here?
DANIEL
I couldn't sleep. I was thinking that I must be missing something,
and now I just realized. We ruled out a world we shouldn't have.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER kneels next to O'NEILL, who is lying on the ground.]
O'NEILL
I guess it didn't work.
CARTER
I'm sorry.
O'NEILL
Not your fault.
CARTER
I don't understand why it won't work!
O'NEILL
Captain, plan B. Go.
CARTER
No, Sir...
O'NEILL
Sam...I'm dying. Follow my order. Please.
CARTER
Sir...
O'NEILL
Please.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
[CARTER picks up their supplies. She nods at O'NEILL and leaves the
cavern. She tries to climb the icy crevasse.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[HAMMOND, DANIEL and TEAL'C are in the room.]
DANIEL
How many Earth-based cultures have we encountered from other worlds
from periods both before and after we think the Stargate was buried?
HAMMOND
Several, I think.
DANIEL
Right, and we've probably only scratched the surface. Now, so far
we've tried to account for these discrepancies with various theories
of parallel or accelerated...
HAMMOND
What's your point, Doctor?
DANIEL
What if...there's a second Stargate here. What if this energy surge
caused the wormhole to jump from one Stargate to another...here.
(Daniel taps the circle in the center of the map.)
HAMMOND
On Earth?
DANIEL
Yes.
HAMMOND
Teal'c, would the Goa'uld have put more than one Stargate on a
planet?
TEAL'C
If the first became lost to them, it is possible.
DANIEL
Remember, the one that Ra put here might not have been the first.
The Goa'uld didn't build the Stargate system.
HAMMOND
Then where is it?
INT--ICE CAVE
[CARTER is climbing up in an icy tunnel.]
CARTER
(Uses radio)
Colonel, I can't see the surface yet, it looks like it just keeps
going up.
O'NEILL
Sam.
CARTER
Yes Sir?
O'NEILL
It was an honor serving with you.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
[CARTER blinks back tears and keeps climbing.]
INT--OBSERVATION ROOM
[DANIEL is pacing. TEAL'C and HAMMOND are standing over DAVIS, who has
a computer console in front of him.]
DANIEL
It would have to be in a remote location otherwise it would have
been discovered by now. It could have even been buried until
recently otherwise the Goa'uld would have continued to use it.
TEAL'C
Let us hope it is not still buried.
HAMMOND
(To Davis)
We're looking for radio transmissions on SG-1's emergency frequency.
Co-ordinate with our military listening posts around the entire
globe.
DANIEL
General, when we first opened our Stargate, it used to shake...a
LOT. I mean, the ground, the whole facility, everything.
HAMMOND
Since then, we've installed frequency dampers that limit that to
only a slight vibration.
DANIEL
Okay, but what if the second Gate doesn't have...those. Would it
shake enough to indicate its location on a seismometer?
HAMMOND
Damn right it would. Run a search for all recent seismic activity
worldwide. See if any coincide with the time of our Stargate
malfunction.
DANIEL
And check about 4am local time. I was here, I thought someone was
trying an offworld activation, but nothing happened. Except for the
chevrons glowed and there was a slight vibration.
TEALC
Captain Carter and Colonel O'Neill.
DANIEL
(To Teal'c)
What happens when you dial your own phone number?
(He looks at Teal'c's blank face.)
Wrong person to ask.
(To Hammond)
What happens when you dial your own phone number?
HAMMOND
You get a busy signal.
DANIEL
Exactly. What else could cause a vibration like that unless if they
were trying to dial home? They couldn't get through. I mean, even if
their seventh symbol looked different, the coordinates of the two
gates would still be exactly the same.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER is still climbing.]
CARTER
(Uses radio)
Colonel, I'm almost there. I'm going to try and bring back help,
Sir, I want you to hold that thought.
[O'NEILL is no longer conscious. CARTER climbs out into the light. She
turns in a circle. There is ice for as far as the eye can see.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
DAVIS
We got it! Antarctica! The timing of the event is to the second,
including the event that Dr. Jackson experienced a few hours ago!
HAMMOND
Latitude and longitude?
DAVIS
Yes Sir! It's only about 50 miles out of McMurdo!
TEAL'C and DANIEL:
General, permission...
HAMMOND
Granted! Order McMurdo station to begin a search of those
coordinates NOW.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER is still at the planet's surface.]
CARTER
(Uses radio)
Colonel? It's an ice planet. That's all there is as far as the eye
can see. No chance.
[CARTER climbs back into the tunnel and shouts to O'NEILL.]
CARTER
Colonel! I'm coming down!
(She loses her footing and slides all the way down to fall beside
O'Neill.)
Colonel.
(She crawls to his side.)
Colonel...
O'NEILL
(Not opening his eyes.)
Sara...
CARTER
I'm here, Jack.
O'NEILL
Cold, so cold...
CARTER
I know. It's all right. You can sleep now. It was an honor serving
with you too, Colonel.
EXT--ANTARCTICA
[Helicopters and rescue teams converge over the pair's position. Men
are lowered down into the cavern on ropes.]
RADIO
McMurdo, this is rescue team Charlie, we found them. Over.
INT--ICE CAVERN
[CARTER is strapped to a stretcher.]
DANIEL
Sam! Sam! Come on.
[CARTER slowly opens her eyes.]
DANIEL
She's going to be okay, you're going to be okay.
TEAL'C
As is Colonel O'Neill.
[O'NEILL is also strapped to a stretcher.]
HAMMOND
Let's get them in the chopper.
CARTER
...the Colonel...he's bleeding internally.
HAMMOND
We know, Captain, don't worry, he's going to be all right.
CARTER
General, you came through the Stargate for us...
HAMMOND
Not exactly, Captain.
(To one of the rescue team)
A team from the SGC will be arriving within the hour to secure this
area. In the meantime let's get these people home.
[HAMMOND turns, his gaze falls upon the icy Stargate...]
