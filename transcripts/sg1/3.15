TEASER
FADE IN
EXT--SPACE
[A glider is under fire from two huge Goa'uld motherships, orbiting a
planet. Multiple blasts from the planet destroys both motherships and
the damaged glider enters the planet's atmosphere.]
EXT--PLANET (DAY)
[The glider crash lands in a field and people come running. The pilot
inside is Skaara, who has been badly injured.]
SKAARA
(to the people)
Please! Help me.
[He passes out.]
END OF TEASER
INT--GATE ROOM, SGC
[There is an incoming wormhole, but the iris is closed. SGC soldiers
are pointing their weapons at the Stargate. General HAMMOND and SG-1
are watching from in the Control Room.]
TECHNICIAN
(to Hammond)
Still no incoming signal, sir.
HAMMOND
All units are Earthside.
[The iris appears to flex and wobble slightly.]
DANIEL
Is it my eyes or does the iris look kinda...
[He waves his hand slightly.</blockquote>
CARTER
It's losing integrity.
[A fat, ginger cat materialises through the iris and pads down the
ramp.]
CARTER
Hold fire!
[She rushes into the Gateroom and picks up the cat.]
CARTER
(cont'd)
It's Schrodinger. The cat I gave to the Tollan, Narim.
O'NEILL
Cat.
TEAL'C
The Tollan possess the technology to walk through solid matter.
O'NEILL
A technology which, by the way if you all recall, they refused to
share with us.
[A man emerges through the iris. It is Narim.]
NARIM
General Hammond, I am unfamiliar with Earth protocol in these
matters. I sent Schrodinger so you would know a friend was coming.
HAMMOND
It's all right, Narim, the Tollan are welcome here.
(to the soldiers)
Units, stand down.
[The soldiers lower their weapons as Narim walks down the ramp to meet
Carter.]
NARIM
Samantha. It's good to see you again.
CARTER
It's good to see you too.
[Hammond and the rest of SG-1 enters the Gateroom.]
HAMMOND
What can we do for you NARIM?
NARIM
I am here to deliver a message from our highest governing body.
Colonel O'Neill, the Tollan Curia requests the presence of you and
your team...for Triad.
[He offers O'Neill a blue, triangle-shaped device.]
O'NEILL
I feel like I'm being served.
INT--DEBRIEFING ROOM, SGC
[SG-1 and Hammond are sitting at the table as Narim explains the
situation. O'Neill is toying with the device.]
O'NEILL
So what exactly is this Triad?
NARIM
It's an ancient ceremony of justice, quite honourable.
DANIEL
So it's kind of like a trial.
NARIM
I am not familiar with...trial.
DANIEL
Trial, it's sort of like a tribunal, a place where matters of
justice and the law are decided.
NARIM
Then yes, a triad is similar to your trial.
O'NEILL
So, who's on trial?
DANIEL
Triad.
O'NEILL
Triad...
NARIM
The decision Triad must reach is of great concern to an old friend
of yours. He is an Abydonian by the name of Skaara.
O'NEILL AND DANIEL
What?
NARIM
It is he who requested your presence.
DANIEL
He's alive? He's ok? He's...?
NARIM
He is well. But he does need your help for Triad.
O'NEILL
Where's this taking place?
NARIM
Our destination is the new homeworld, Tollana.
CARTER
But we sent you to the Nox planet. There wasn't a Gate on Tollana.
NARIM
The Nox and the Tollan were able to devise a way to get us there.
O'NEILL
Of course you were.
DANIEL
Way smarter than we are.
VFX--SHOOTING THROUGH WORMHOLE
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[SG-1 and NARIM step out of a Stargate. There are lawns and a few
buildings around them.]
O'NEILL
Very nice.
CARTER
(to Narim)
So you built that...Stargate?
NARIM
Yes.
DANIEL
Way smarter than we are.
O'NEILL
Ours is bigger.
[They follow Narim over to one of the buildings and through a walkway.]
INT--COURTHOUSE, TOLLANA
[Narim leads the way down a narrow corridor. A white light comes out
and scans each of SG-1.]
DANIEL
What just happened?
NARIM
Your weapons have been disabled.
O'NEILL
What?
[He checks his gun, but it appears jammed.]
NARIM
Do not worry. You may continue to carry them if you wish.
O'NEILL
You don't think you should have told us about this before we came?
NARIM
I didn't find it relevant.
O'NEILL
We don't travel to other planets without weapons with which to
defend ourselves.
NARIM
May I ask what you intend to defend yourself against? The Tollan
have never threatened you, in any way.
TEAL'C
That is correct, O'Neill. I do not feel the need to carry a weapon
in this place.
CARTER
And, sir, judging by what I've seen in the last five minutes, our
weapons wouldn't be much of a match for their technology any way.
NARIM
No harm will come to you. The Tollan will guarantee it.
O'NEILL
Is that a 'money back if you're not completely alive' guarantee?
NARIM
This way.
[He gestures for them to continue to follow.]
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[Narim and SG-1 enter what looks like a large courtroom. There is a
woman sitting at a high podium. The screen before her slides down and
she rises to greet the visitors.]
WOMAN
These must be our visitors from Earth. Welcome.
NARIM
High Chancellor Travell, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Hi.
NARIM
Dr Daniel Jackson. Major Samantha Carter.
CARTER
Hello.
NARIM
And Teal'c.
TRAVELL
We are honoured that you have agree to participate in Triad. Your
seeker will decide which one of you will be archon.
O'NEILL
Seeker? Archon? Daniel?
DANIEL
Uh, with respect High Chancellor, NARIM didn't really explain the
Triad very well. Could you please define those terms for us.
TRAVELL
In Triad there are two arguing parties, called seekers. Triadic law
requires one archon who is sympathetic to each cause, and one
neutral archon. The archons argue the dispute until a decision is
reached.
DANIEL
So a seeker is like a defendant and the archon is his attorney.
O'NEILL
I got it. So Skaara is our...
DANIEL
Seeker.
O'NEILL
Seeker?
TRAVELL
NARIM will take you to him now.
NARIM
This way.
INT--CELL, TOLLANA
[Two Tollans are guarding a room. Narim deactivates the forcefield and
SG-1 follows him inside. There is a man standing with his back to
them.]
CARTER
Skaara?
[The man turns around, his eyes glowing, a device on his chest showing
red.]
KLOREL
(in a Goa'uld voice)
You. You will pay for what you did to my father.
O'NEILL
It's good to see you too.
[Klorel's head drops and the device turns blue.]
SKAARA
(in a normal voice)
I'm very happy to see you. All of you.
O'NEILL
(to Narim)
What's the deal? What just happened?
NARIM
The Tollan designed the device worn about his chest. It suppresses
the Goa'uld's ability to silence its host. The Goa'uld and host are
free to speak at will. The device cannot be removed as long as
Klorel and Skaara are our guests. The indicator on the front
prevents one from pretending to be the other. Red indicates it is
Klorel who speaks...blue Skaara.
O'NEILL
Nice device. We'll take a dozen.
NARIM
As you may recall from our last encounter, it is forbidden for the
Tollan to give our technology to any culture less advanced than our
own.
O'NEILL
Still got that arrogance bug, I see.
SKAARA
It is I O'Neill. Are you not happy to see me?
[O'Neill walks over to him.]
O'NEILL
(warily)
Yeah. It's good to see you.
SKAARA
I knew you would come. Soon, with your help, I'll be free of this
demon. Every day I fight him. I listen, I learn.
NARIM
It is time for Skaara to choose his archon.
SKAARA
O'Neill is strong. Daniel is wise. May I not choose both?
NARIM
You may. They may both argue. However, they will have but one vote.
DANIEL
Ok. What's this Triad about? What's to be decided?
NARIM
Two days ago, a small Goa'uld vessel crashed in a remote area. The
occupant was badly injured. It was Skaara.
SKAARA
We were fleeing a battle group despatched by Heru-Ur. My demon knew
that the Tollans would stop them.
NARIM
Which we did. We warned them, but...they came anyway. Our defence
grip was forced to destroy them.
CARTER
So, Heru-Ur is dead.
SKAARA
No. But two of his motherships are destroyed.
O'NEILL
(to Narim)
Wait a minute. You blew away two Goa'uld motherships?
NARIM
We are not a warring people, but our defensive technology is far
more advanced than that of the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Yeah, well I know all this weapons chatter gets my blood
pumping...can we get back to the Triad?
NARIM
Yes, of course. When our sentries reached the crashed vessel, Skaara
asked us to free him of his Goa'uld. But the Goa'uld refuses.
Therefore under Tollan law we have no choice but to hear both
arguments before acting.
O'NEILL
And Klorel's archon is...who?
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[The doors open and a man walks in with a group of Jaffa. He bows to
Klorel while SG-1 look on in concern.]
TRAVELL
My Lord Zipacna, we are honoured that you have agreed to participate
in Triad.
ZIPACNA
Due to your easy despatch of Heru-Ur's motherships, I do not have a
choice.
KLOREL
(to Travell)
We would speak in private.
TRAVELL
As you wish.
[Zipacna and Klorel leave the room with the Jaffa.]
O'NEILL
(to Travell)
So. When you were trying to get us to come here and then...disarmed
us, you didn't feel it appropriate to mention the fact that a
freaking Goa'uld is going to be here? Not to mention his associates?
TRAVELL
They are as unarmed as you.
O'NEILL
You sure of that?
NARIM
Our technology detects and disables any form of weaponry.
O'NEILL
(sceptically)
Ah.
DANIEL
You said there was a third, neutral archon. That's...a Tollan?
TRAVELL
No. We have asked our friends to send someone capable of remaining
neutral. I believe you have met.
[A curtain is drawn aside to admit a familiar woman.]
DANIEL
Lya.
LYA
It is good to see you once again, friends.
INT--WAITING ROOM, TOLLANA
[SG-1 enter the room.]
O'NEILL
(confidently)
Well, this just became a piece of cake, a walk in the park, a day at
the beach.
DANIEL
An accident waiting for a place to happen.
O'NEILL
Mr Negative.
(he takes a seat)
Yes.
CARTER
Sir, what makes you so confident?
O'NEILL
Because Lya is a fair and insightful person who'll vote our way.
Besides, she likes us.
DANIEL
Lya likes everyone. That's the Nox way.
TEAL'C
The Nox are not in conflict with the Goa'uld. You may recall they
saved Apophis when you attempted to eliminate him.
O'NEILL
So, what do we have on this fine, Goa'uld fella?
TEAL'C
Zipacna was one of Apophis' most loyal underlords.
O'NEILL
Well, I don't believe for a second he's come to talk Klorel out of
here.
[There is a chime and O'Neill looks about in confusion. Narim enters
the room.]
NARIM
They are ready for you.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[Narim leaves.]
O'NEILL
Carter, you and Teal'c keep an eye on ZIPPY's kids.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
See what they're up to.
[He and Daniel leave the room.]
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[Travell is seated at the podium. Daniel and O'Neill are seated on one
side of the courtroom, Zipacna on the other, with Lya between them.
Klorel stands in the middle of the room.]
TRAVELL
This dispute involves two sentient beings who inhabit the same body.
Both have requested sole use of the body, therefore we must
established right of priority over the body to whom does it belong.
O'NEILL
Ostensibly, the one to whom it was born.
[Zipacna rises.]
ZIPACNA
Your Eminence, I must request that the human contingent follow
decorum appropriate to such an auspicious body as this one.
TRAVELL
I agree. The archons will refrain from questions or comments until
their side is acknowledged. At this time, I recognised Lord Zipacna
and Klorel.
ZIPACNA
Until three years ago, the humans on Abydos lived under Goa'uld
law...administered by Ra. Now by that law, they were Goa'uld
property. Lord Klorel merely took what was already his.
O'NEILL
By force.
TRAVELL
Colonel O'Neill, please.
O'NEILL
Sorry.
TRAVELL
I understand your desire to defend your position, Colonel, and I
will give you that opportunity. I would first like to hear Skaara's
perspective.
[The device on Klorel's chest turns blue and Skaara takes over.]
SKAARA
I was born to this body. Free of the demon Klorel. He stole my body.
On Abydos, I would have married, had children, grown old and died.
The Goa'uld took more than my body...he stole my life.
TRAVELL
Human archons.
[Daniel rises.]
DANIEL
Skaara, when you were born, did your people believe you were slaves?
SKAARA
No.
DANIEL
Just so we can all be clear, who was Ra?
SKAARA
We believed him to be an evil god.
DANIEL
So he enslaved your people through superstition and fear?
SKAARA
Until you came. Yes.
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[Teal'c and Carter pretend to examine a sculpture as the Jaffa
contingent marches passed. They then start to follow.]
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[Zipacna rises and moves to stand before Skaara.]
ZIPACNA
Tell me, did the people of Abydos hunt?
SKAARA
Yes.
ZIPACNA
Do they also use animals as beasts of burden for food, for clothing?
SKAARA
Yes.
ZIPACNA
Do you also eat the flesh of humans?
SKAARA
No! Never!
ZIPACNA
Then you make judgement that animals are of lesser value than
humans.
SKAARA
We care for our animals. We worship them, we thank them for the
gifts they give us.
ZIPACNA
Yes, but you keep them to do your will and you kill them to survive.
SKAARA
When we have the need.
ZIPACNA
As we do with humans, when we have the need. If a human has the
right to take an animal's body and do with it as he pleases because
he is a superior being...then so does a Goa'uld. And by that
argument alone, the Goa'uld has priority. And the host belongs to
Klorel.
TRAVELL
Do the human archons wish to respond?
O'NEILL
Yes, ma'am, you betcha.
DANIEL
We do, your Eminence.
[Daniel gestures for O'Neill to speak.]
O'NEILL
(to Zipacna)
Your argument is flawed in oh so many ways. Humans are self-aware,
animals aren't.
ZIPACNA
Animals are not because you deem them not to be. Just as we deem
humans not to be.
DANIEL
What my learned colleague means is that humans have a more advanced
intelligence than lower-caste animals.
O'NEILL
Exactly, just like that.
ZIPACNA
Is that not a matter of perspective? Just like a human considers
itself more intelligent than a pig, might a pig consider itself more
intelligent than a rat?
O'NEILL
Speaking of rats...what's your point?
ZIPACNA
My point is that the Goa'uld consider ourselves more intelligent
than humans. Our technology is more advanced than yours, our mere
knowledge of the universe is more advanced than yours.
O'NEILL
You stole that knowledge!
[Daniel gets up and joins him.]
DANIEL
You took human knowledge when you took humans as hosts, just as you
took knowledge from other species. The Stargate isn't your
technology, you just...you took that. As far as we know, nothing you
have came from you. So, clearly the evidence is not that you're more
intelligent, just...more parasitic.
ZIPACNA
The method of gaining the knowledge is not in question. We were able
to obtain it. You were not.
O'NEILL
Oh please.
TRAVELL
Gentlemen, we seem to have wandered away from the central topic.
Which seeker has priority over this body.
DANIEL
If I may, your Eminence, I don't think we've ventured away from the
central topic at all. What we're trying to point out is that Goa'uld
steal what they possess...as they have in fact stolen Skaara's body.
O'NEILL
Can I...sorry Daniel...can I say something?
[Daniel retakes his seat.]
O'NEILL
Skaara, you once told me you'd rather die than live another day as a
Goa'uld. Why?
SKAARA
What I suffer each day is worse than death.
O'NEILL
For example.
SKAARA
(upset)
I remember the demon stretching out my hand to kill Daniel, the
husband of my sister. There was nothing I could do to stop it. And I
have seen many more, far worse atrocities than this.
ZIPACNA
I demand that the human stay on topic!
O'NEILL
It is on topic. You just want to avoid talking about all the nasty
stuff he's witnessed.
ZIPACNA
The host witnesses nothing, since nothing of the host survives.
[Skaara lowers his head and struggles not to cry.]
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[Carter looks through a pair of field glasses and sees the Jaffa
standing alongside the Tollan ion canon. She hands the binoculars to
Teal'c.]
CARTER
What are they doing?
TEAL'C
I am uncertain.
[Carter takes the binoculars and sees the Jaffa leaving. She and Teal'c
get up to follow.]
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[Daniel stands.]
DANIEL
Lord Zipacna, I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.
ZIPACNA
I hope I have the answer.
[Daniel walks over to Zipacna.]
DANIEL
I'm sure you will. Is your host in there somewhere?
ZIPACNA
Nothing of the host survives.
DANIEL
Really. Then how do you explain Skaara?
ZIPACNA
What you call Skaara is nothing but a remnant. He can speak now only
because the Tollan use their technology to silence Klorel.
DANIEL
But how could he speak at all if he hadn't survived?
LYA
(looking at Skaara)
And he spoke well. His words were not those of a remnant
personality.
INT--WAITING ROOM, TOLLANA
[O'Neill and Daniel return to the room to find Carter and Teal'c
waiting for them.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
Sir, we may have a problem.
O'NEILL
Do tell.
TEAL'C
We tracked a serpent guard and two Jaffa to just outside the city
limits. We observed them locate at least six Tollan weapon sites.
CARTER
We think they were doing something to disable them, sir. Which, in
my opinion, means Zipacna is using the Triad to stall for time so
his men can disable the Tollan defences. Then, take the opportunity
to...
O'NEILL
Wipe out the Tollan.
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[Carter is standing by a pond. Narim walks up behind her.]
NARIM
Samantha. I hope you've not waited long.
CARTER
No. Thank you for coming.
NARIM
It is my pleasure. In fact, I am pleased that we can finally be
alone together.
CARTER
Narim, I asked you to meet me because I need your help.
NARIM
Samantha I...I have missed you.
CARTER
A lot's happened to me since I last saw you.
NARIM
There is another.
CARTER
No! Not in the way that you mean. You see, I was blended with a
Tok'ra, and she died to save my life. I still have her memories and
her feelings.
NARIM
And she is part of you?
CARTER
Yes. I can't have a relationship with anyone until I'm absolutely
sure whose feelings I'm...feeling. Do you understand?
NARIM
You are very wise, Samantha. May I ask then why you sent for me?
CARTER
Teal'c and I have been following the Jaffa that came with the
Goa'uld contingent.
NARIM
(shocked)
Samantha, why would you do such a thing? I was sure your people were
more diplomatic than that.
CARTER
We did it out of concern for your people. We think the Goa'uld are
using the Triad to buy time so that they can prepare for an attack
on Tollana.
NARIM
Why do you think that?
CARTER
Because we saw them tampering with your weapons.
NARIM
That would be impossible. The weapons are made of an impenetrable
alloy and are protected by security codes.
CARTER
Narim, they were doing something to them.
[Narim inclines his head in acknowledgement.]
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[A Tollan is examining one of the ion canons as SG-1, Travell and Narim
look on.]
TRAVELL
We asked Lord Zipacna about your accusation. He denied it and he was
quite offended.
O'NEILL
Well, that's a shocker. I hope you didn't take his word for it.
TRAVELL
Our experts have been unable to find any form of tampering on any of
the canons.
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Maybe they were painting them, sir.
TRAVELL
I see no paint.
CARTER
(to Travell)
Uh, sorry, it's an Earth military expression. It means marking them
as targets.
TRAVELL
Nor do I see any markings.
CARTER
Well, there are ways that they can target the weapons without
actually leaving a mark.
TRAVELL
If so, the instant one of these canons is attacked, the rest will
automatically locate the position of the attacker and destroy it.
O'NEILL
Unless they're all taken out simultaneously.
TRAVELL
If that were possible, why then did the Goa'uld Heru-Ur not do so
when he pursued Klorel?
CARTER
Well maybe because he didn't have a contingent on the planet's
surface targeting the weapons in advance.
TRAVELL
He didn't do it because it is impossible. It would take but one of
these devices to protect this planet from a Goa'uld mothership and
we have many more than that. Our technology is superior in every way
to theirs...and to yours.
O'NEILL
My, aren't we cocky.
TRAVELL
Colonel, if this is an attempt to influence the outcome of Triad, it
is a feeble attempt indeed.
DANIEL
I assure you, your Eminence, this is not intended as anything other
than an attempt to help your people.
TRAVELL
I hope so. But understand, if you continue to pursue this matter in
any way, I will disqualify you from Triad and replace you. Skaara
will be represented by someone else. Is that understood?
O'NEILL
With protest.
TRAVELL
Now, you will return to Triad in the morning and you will not
mention this matter any further.
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[SG-1 are standing in a courtyard.]
O'NEILL
Just...stay away from ZIPPY and his gaggle of Goa'ulds, ok?
TEAL'C
I know the Goa'uld, O'Neill. They will attack.
O'NEILL
But I don't see a choice here. If we keep pursuing the issue,
Skaara's going to be represented by God knows who and then we won't
stand a chance in hell. I'm not going to let that happen.
TEAL'C
Regrettably, I must disagree with you in this situation, O'Neill. I
believe we are faced with the loss of Skaara, one individual, versus
the death of many Tollan and possibly ourselves.
DANIEL
That's assuming the Tollan can't defend themselves which,
personally, I think is a false assumption.
O'NEILL
Yeah, they did bring down a couple of motherships. I think they'll
be ok.
TEAL'C
The Tollan have not been at war in many generations. They do not
think strategically. I believe that to be a fatal flaw.
CARTER
Their naivety could be their downfall.
TEAL'C
That is correct. Allow Major Carter and myself to continue
monitoring the Goa'uld contingent, in case of...
[He breaks off as Narim walks over.]
NARIM
Excuse my interruption. The Triad resumes.
[He leaves.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
You've got your orders. Stand down.
INT--LYA'S ROOM, TOLLANA
[Lya is sitting in her room, meditating. Teal'c enters from behind and
she opens her eyes.]
LYA
Teal'c.
[She stands and turns around.]
LYA
(cont'd)
This is highly inappropriate of you to come to me during Triad.
TEAL'C
I assure you that I would never intend to influence your decision in
any way. I wish to speak to you concerning another matter.
LYA
You must not mention Klorel or Skaara. If you do, I will be forced
to report the matter to the Tollan.
TEAL'C
Understood.
LYA
What is it then?
TEAL'C
As you are aware, I was formerly in the service of the Goa'uld.
LYA
If this is designed to bias me against the Goa'uld...
TEAL'C
I would never do such a thing, nor do I feel the need. I am here in
fact in direct violation of an order given by Colonel O'Neill.
LYA
Go on.
TEAL'C
I have become convinced that the Goa'uld are planning to destroy all
the Tollan weapon installations simultaneously, thereby preventing
them from ever returning fire. The Goa'uld will then attack this
world, which will be defenceless.
LYA
Why do you tell me this?
TEAL'C
I believe that you and I are the only ones capable of preventing
this tragedy from occurring.
LYA
You and I? Teal'c, you are a strong warrior, but I am of the Nox. If
you've learned anything of us, you've learned that we defend
ourselves through illusion and mastery of the mind.
TEAL'C
Precisely.
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[O'Neill is tapping his hand on the table, while Zipacna examines his
fingernails. Lya enters the room and they rise as she takes her place.]
LYA
I apologise for my tardiness.
TRAVELL
We will resume. Lord Zipacna has asked us to reconvene early because
he wishes to make a challenge.
[Zipacna stands before Travell.]
ZIPACNA
Tollan law does not provide for a penalty of death. Is that correct?
TRAVELL
It is.
ZIPACNA
Then I wish to point out the futility of this trial. A Goa'uld needs
a host to survive. This is a biological fact beyond our control. If
you award priority to Skaara, then it is as a death sentence for
Klorel.
O'NEILL
Course, if you flip that around you've got Skaara on death row.
ZIPACNA
Yes. But as you proved earlier in Triad, the host survives.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
ZIPACNA
We concede this point. Therefore, if you award priority to Klorel,
both host and symbiote live.
[He bows and sits down.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, one lives freely, the other lives as a slave.
DANIEL
We would put forth that life as a slave is not life at all.
O'NEILL
And if you want to save both lives, give us Skaara...and take
Klorel. The Tok'ra can put him in another host for all I care.
LYA
Who Colonel? Perhaps you would volunteer?
O'NEILL
Uh...no.
DANIEL
Perhaps you could find someone who would choose to be a host.
[The doors open and NARIM enters, followed by Carter and Teal'c.]
TRAVELL
NARIM, what is the meaning of this? You know Triad is held as a
closed session.
NARIM
Your Eminence, please adjust your viewer to the orbital observatory.
[A screen appears before Travell. In it, she sees the planet and a
ship.]
TRAVELL
A Goa'uld mothership.
NARIM
Yes. It approaches Tollana.
EXT--SPACE
[The Goa'uld mothership is heading for the planet.]
INT--COURTROOM, TOLLANA
[Zipacna, O'Neill and Daniel stand before the podium.]
TRAVELL
Explain.
ZIPACNA
My vessel comes in anticipation of our victory in Triad. It is
merely coming to take us aboard.
O'NEILL
Why don't you just take a Stargate like the rest of us?
ZIPACNA
Not that it is of your concern, but there is no Chapp'ai where we
are going.
O'NEILL
Well then Gate to where there is one and get picked up.
ZIPACNA
(to Travell)
Your Eminence, if our intentions were hostile, we would have
attacked already.
TRAVELL
Even so, your ship's arrival is premature and in violation of Tollan
space. I must warn you, that if your ship moves any closer before
the conclusion of Triad, our automated defence system will destroy
it.
ZIPACNA
The Goa'uld rest our case and we are prepared to vote. Therefore
Triad is over.
TRAVELL
Triad is over when all parties agree, Lord Zipacna. Do the human
archons have any further arguments?
O'NEILL
Nope. I think the Goa'uld made our case for us quite nicely.
[He points to the Goa'uld mothership on the screen.]
DANIEL
No further arguments, your Eminence. We are prepared to vote.
TRAVELL
Nox archon?
LYA
Yes.
TRAVELL
Then bring in the seekers.
[The archons return to their seats. Skaara is escorted into the room.]
TRAVELL
Klorel and Skaara. You can both hear the Triad's ruling?
SKAARA
Yes, your Eminence.
[The device turns red and Skaara's eyes glow.]
KLOREL
I can.
TRAVELL
Human archons, may we hear your vote?
DANIEL
We find in favour of Skaara.
TRAVELL
Goa'uld archon?
ZIPACNA
In favour of Klorel.
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Big surprise there.
TRAVELL
Nox archon?
LYA
After careful consideration, I believe that both Klorel and Skaara
have the right to live. But living as a host with no will of one's
own is not life, therefore only one may remain in the body. To that
end, I award priority to the original owner of the body. Skaara.
[Klorel's eyes flare in fury.]
O'NEILL
Yes.
(to Zipacna)
Now get that mothership outta here.
TRAVELL
We will summon the Tok'ra to come to Tollana to assist in the
removal of the Goa'uld Klorel. He will be removed from the host and
if he survives, will be sent to the Goa'uld world of his choice.
[She uses a piece of technology and the device on Skaara's chest turns
blue.]
TRAVELL
(cont'd)
I have locked the detachment device. Skaara, you have priority
control until the Goa'uld is removed. Prepare yourself. The Tok'ra
will arrive as soon as possible. And congratulations.
SKAARA
Thank you.
TRAVELL
Lord Zipacna, you are dismissed...with our thanks.
[He bows his head in acknowledgement. As Travell leaves, he takes a
ball-shaped device from underneath the table and speaks into it.]
ZIPACNA
Re'nuk'tok.
[Teal'c sees and crashes into him, knocking the device away.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
[O'Neill punches Zipacna, who is then grabbed in headlock by Teal'c.
Zipacna collapses.]
O'NEILL
Nice. Let's go!
[SG-1 and Skaara run out of the courtroom and into a hallway with
running people. O'Neill gestures for Skaara to go into a room.]
O'NEILL
Skaara, wait here. Just trust me.
EXT--TOLLANA (DAY)
[O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and NARIM run across the Tollan grounds.]
O'NEILL
(to Narim)
How's your technology looking now? Security system serving you
pretty good, is it?
[Bolts of energy are striking the planet.]
DANIEL
The ion canons.
O'NEILL
Got a dead lock on all of them.
(To Narim)
You know, I hate when people waste my time like this.
DANIEL
Where's Teal'c?
[The bolts of energy destroy the ion canons.]
CARTER
Colonel!
[Goa'uld gliders swoop and start to destroy buildings.]
O'NEILL
Take cover!
[They run for shelter and come across Teal'c and Lya. There are
explosions all around.]
NARIM
I must inform Travell!
[He runs off.]
TEAL'C
Zipacna has escaped through the Stargate.
O'NEILL
Well that's the least of our problems. Where have you been?
TEAL'C
I must inform you, O'Neill, that I have disregarded your orders
concerning the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Please explain.
[Teal'c nods to Lya, who makes them all vanish. They materialise in the
woods, away from the city.]
O'NEILL
So what's going on here?
TEAL'C
I have requested Lya's assistance.
[An ion canon suddenly appears before them.]
CARTER
You hid one.
TEAL'C
That is correct. Travell explained that it would take but one of
these to destroy a Goa'uld mothership.
[Two Goa'uld gliders start to come in.]
TEAL'C
(cont'd)
It should have already fired.
O'NEILL
Well it hasn't. Let's take cover.
[O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and Lya run for the trees, while being fired
upon by the gliders. Teal'c remains with the canon and adjusts its
controls. The canon lifts and opens fire, destroying the two gliders.
It then fires bolts of energy into the sky, destroying the Goa'uld
mothership in orbit.]
O'NEILL
Very nice.
[There is a fireball in the sky.]
INT--COURTHOUSE, TOLLANA
[Travell approaches Teal'c.]
TRAVELL
You disregarded my warnings.
O'NEILL
Mine too. Well done.
TRAVELL
If you were one of my subjects, I would be forced to discipline you.
However, you are not one of my subjects.
[She places her hand against his chest and bows.]
TEAL'C
It could not have been done without the assistance of Lya.
CARTER
(to Lya)
I thought the Nox were pacifists.
LYA
I only hid the weapon. I did not fire it.
CARTER
Pretty fine line you didn't cross.
LYA
Yes it is.
O'NEILL
(to Travell)
So, we basically saved your whole planet, right?
TRAVELL
Yes.
O'NEILL
Are you therefore indebted to us in any modest way?
TRAVELL
I suppose that is the case.
O'NEILL
So how about giving us the plans to build one of those ion canons?
TRAVELL
You have been told our policy. That has not changed.
[Daniel enters the room.]
DANIEL
The, uh, Tok'ra have completed the procedure.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
[Two Tok'ra carry out a jar containing Klorel's Goa'uld form.]
LYA
What will become of Klorel?
NARIM
He will be sent to a Goa'uld world.
O'NEILL
To hell with him, what about...?
SKAARA
O'Neill!
[Skaara runs up to him.]
O'NEILL
(smiling)
Much better.
[They share a hug. Skaara catches sight of Teal'c and they shake hands,
before Carter embraces Skaara.]
FADE OUT
THE END
