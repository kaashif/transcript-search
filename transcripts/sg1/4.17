TEASER
EXT--ABYDOS, OUT IN THE DESERT
[Carter, O'Neill, Daniel, Teal'c and Kasuf are walking in the sand.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, Kasuf. About this voice that spoke to you?
KASUF
Yes. It spoke the name of my daughter, may she rest in peace. I'm
not the only one who heard it. Many fear it is a sign that the gods
are returning.
O'NEILL
I thought we'd finally convinced you and your people that the
Goa'uld were not gods.
KASUF
I said many, not I. But it is easy to understand. In the days of Ra,
when he returned from a journey, a great storm would blow through
the desert.
O'NEILL
It's just wind. Wind happens.
CARTER
We're talking about a wind that blew out of an active Stargate.
DANIEL
And formed a sandstorm.
KASUF
You forget it said the name Sha're.
O'NEILL
Ahh, well, it's not like a burning bush or anything.
KASUF
I have seen many bushes burn.
O'NEILL
S'pose you have.
KASUF
It is not far now.
KASUF
Here.
DANIEL
There's nothing here.
O'NEILL
Nice light breeze.
KASUF
This is where I heard the voice.
CARTER
I'm getting a build up of static electricity, Sir.
CHILD'S VOICE
Daniel. Daniel.
DANIEL
Anybody else just hear that?
CARTER
I think so.
KASUF
Look.
[A sandstorm blows up in front of them in a column.]
O'NEILL
Now that's impressive.
CHILD'S VOICE
Daniel.
O'NEILL
Daniel? Try to keep it in Kansas, huh.
DANIEL
I was just trying to. I'm Daniel. Who's calling?
[A boy, Shifu, appears as the sand storm vanishes. He walks towards
Daniel.]
SHIFU
I am Shifu. I am Harcesis.
OPENING TITLES
EXT--ABYDOS, THE VILLAGE
[Daniel walks out of a tent towards Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c who are
sitting at a table.]
DANIEL
Well, I think that he is the Harcesis.
CARTER
How is that possible?
DANIEL
I'm not sure. He says he grew like the weeds.
TEAL'C
Apophis sired the child to be his next host. It is possible that he
used Goa'uld technology to manipulate the boy's body to mature
quickly.
DANIEL
We know that's possible.
TEAL'C
Does he speak of the knowledge passed onto him by Ammonet and
Apophis?
DANIEL
He says Oma taught him to forget.
O'NEILL
Oma?
DANIEL
The alien we encountered on Kheb. Mother Nature.
CARTER
Guess that explains the tornado.
DANIEL
Shifu says he came to Abydos to learn more about his mother.
O'NEILL
Shi-fu?
DANIEL
His name. It means light.
CARTER
I think we should have Dr. Fraiser to have a look at him. If he's
been altered to grow quickly, it could still be happening.
O'NEILL
Do you think it's wise to bring him back?
DANIEL
I don't think he's a danger.
O'NEILL
What about his stepmom? Is she coming along?
DANIEL
He says that ultimately a man travels his chosen path alone.
O'NEILL
Smart kid. Get a message to Hammond. Let him know who we're
bringing.
INT--SGC, GATE ROOM
[O'Neill, Teal'c, Carter, Daniel and Shifu walk down the ramp. Hammond
is waiting to greet them.]
DANIEL
Shifu. This is General Hammond. He's the leader of this facility.
HAMMOND
Welcome to Earth.
SHIFU
A spark lights a flame but the candle will only burn as long as the
wick.
O'NEILL
If I may, Sir. I think what he means is the wick is the centre of
the candle and ostensibly a great leader like yourself is essential
to the whole ball of wax. Basically what it means is, that's it's
always better to have a big long wick. Right?
DANIEL
Don't look at me.
[Daniel leads Shifu out of the Gate room.]
O'NEILL
It's right though. Right?
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
FRAISER
Okay. Now I'm going to take a little bit of your blood with that
needle.
SHIFU
Will you return it to me when you are done?
FRAISER
I'm afraid I can't. You see I have to do some tests on it and then
it just won't be very good after that.
SHIFU
Leaves fall from the tree once a year but the tree still grows
strong and proud.
DANIEL
Go ahead.
FRAISER
Okay.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel, Fraiser, O'Neill and Teal'c are seated around the table.
Hammond joins them.]
HAMMOND
Doctor?
FRAISER
Sir, I found traces of the same nanocyte technology that once
prematurely aged Colonel O'Neill. Now I've had them analysed by some
of the foremost experts in the field and they say that they appear
to be inactive.
O'NEILL
So they shut themselves off already?
FRAISER
Well, it's possible the boy has already reached the preprogrammed
age.
DANIEL
Or Oma figured out a way to stop it.
HAMMOND
Either way, we can assume he's in no immediate physical danger?
FRAISER
Yes Sir.
HAMMOND
What about the information this boy apparently knows? What exactly
can he tell us?
TEAL'C
He is born with the genetic memory of all Goa'uld who came before
him.
O'NEILL
So the kid should know everything Apophis knew when he...
DANIEL
Fathered the boy.
O'NEILL
That.
HAMMOND
That must be an awfully big burden for a young child to carry.
TEAL'C
That is why all Goa'uld are born evil.
DANIEL
It also explains why a benevolent being like Oma Desala would help
the boy to bury those memories in his subconscious so he could lead
a normal life.
[Carter walks in.]
CARTER
Sir, we've received word from the Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
Oh did we really have to call them?
HAMMOND
We have a treaty with them Colonel, specifically mentioned is the
full exchange of all sources of potential information pertaining to
the Goa'uld.
CARTER
They say they can use the memory recall device to extract
information from Shifu without harming him physically.
FRAISER
What about mentally?
DANIEL
Ahh what about emotionally? I mean think about what we'd be exposing
him to. We'd be flooding his mind with the thoughts of a thousand
Hitlers. One of whom happened put a snake in the head of his mother.
Look I realise we're talking about protecting Earth and potentially
eliminating the Goa'uld entirely but...
HAMMOND
It seems to me the boy is fairly wise well beyond his years in fact.
Isn't it possible he might comprehend the situation if you explained
it to him?
DANIEL
Well I guess so but I doubt he'd be willing to remember. And even if
he is how can we ask him to?
CARTER
Well if he forgot once, maybe he could forget again?
INT--SGC, VIP ROOM
[Shifu and Daniel are talking.]
SHIFU
She spoke to you through the Goa'uld hand device?
DANIEL
Yes.
SHIFU
She was strong.
DANIEL
In those moments as Ammonet tried to kill me it felt like I lived a
lifetime.
SHIFU
Like a dream.
DANIEL
Yes.
SHIFU
Dreams teach.
DANIEL
Sometimes. In this one I got the chance to say goodbye and your
mother told me how important you were.
SHIFU
Oma teaches the true nature of a man is decided in the battle
between his conscious mind and the desires of the subconscious. Oma
teaches the evil my subconscious is too strong to resist and the
only way to win is to deny it battle.
DANIEL
Yeah, see the thing is we can't deny the battle against the Goa'uld
forever. The information contained within your buried memories could
really help us.
SHIFU
You have chosen a path that leads to me because of this?
DANIEL
Yes.
SHIFU
You must release your burden before you will find your own way
again.
DANIEL
Yeah someone else once said that to me. Thing is, this is my way. I
chose this path to honour Sha're's strength and ultimately it isn't
just about me. Or you for that matter.
SHIFU
I understand.
DANIEL
The Tok'ra have a way to help you remember only certain things. How
the Goa'uld technology works, their weaknesses. And then afterwards
maybe Oma can help you forget again.
SHIFU
If the instrument is broken, the music will be sour.
DANIEL
The music does not play the musician.
SHIFU
Normally there is truth in that.
DANIEL
Really? Good. Cause I really didn't have any idea what I was talking
about. All I know is this is very important or I wouldn't ask.
[Shifu raises his palm out to Daniel. He reaches out to touch his
fingertips to Daniel's forehead. A light shines from his fingers.
Daniel falls to the floor, unconscious.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[Daniel is lying on a bed. He opens his eyes. Fraiser picks up the
phone.]
FRAISER
Colonel? He's awake.
DANIEL
What happened?
FRAISER
I was going to ask you the same thing. You were talking to the boy
and then you suddenly collapsed.
[Focus on Daniel. Flash of some technology, maybe a weapon or a mother
ship. O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
Hey! How're you feeling?
DANIEL
Fine, I'm fine.
O'NEILL
Er...Listen, what happened with the kid in there?
DANIEL
I asked him for something. Anything that could help us fight the
Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
DANIEL
And I think he gave it to me.
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Carter and Daniel are in front of a blackboard. Daniel is explaining a
chalk drawing.]
DANIEL
These are the long-range sensors.
CARTER
I don't know what to ask first.
DANIEL
Well, the translation may be a little off. Everything in my head is
actually in Goa'uld.
CARTER
Where does it get its power from?
DANIEL
Liquid naquada fuel cell here.
CARTER
Liquid naquada?
DANIEL
Well, actually, it's heavy liquid naquada, but don't ask me what
makes it heavy--at least not yet.
CARTER
Daniel this...You okay?
DANIEL
Yeah, it's just that strange things just keep flagging in my mind.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
CARTER
Just that this is unbelievable.
DANIEL
I know.
INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Carter puts a piece of paper with drawings on it down in front of
Hammond. Carter and Daniel are standing in front of Hammond's desk]
HAMMOND
What is it?
CARTER
I guess you could call it a satellite, Sir. According to Daniel it
would be capable of detecting approaching Goa'uld ships thousands of
light-years away. Its weapons systems could penetrate Goa'uld shield
technology and destroy mother ships. Basically, Sir, it's the basis
of the perfect anti-Goa'uld defence system.
DANIEL
Of course, we'd need to build an entire network of them and launch
them into orbit.
HAMMOND
Can we do that?
CARTER
Well, Sir, this is an entirely new kind of technology. We'd need to
bring in outside help. A lot of it. Engineers, physicists...
DANIEL
But ultimately it means we don't have to involve the Tok'ra.
HAMMOND
Why not?
DANIEL
At the moment, the Goa'uld don't care what we're up to--we're no
immediate threat. But if it gets out that we've advanced to this
level of technology, we wouldn't be able to build this defence
system fast enough.
HAMMOND
You think the Tok'ra would betray us?
DANIEL
Maybe not intentionally, but they've had problems with Goa'uld spies
before. I don't think it's worth the risk--not when we can do this
without them.
HAMMOND
I'll take that into consideration. What about the boy?
DANIEL
Well, he doesn't have to remember anything now. He's given me all
the knowledge we need.
HAMMOND
How he did that is what concerns me.
DANIEL
He's no danger, Sir.
HAMMOND
Still, as long as he's here he should be kept under close guard.
I'll talk to the Pentagon about bringing in some more personnel to
help you out.
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel is working in front of the blackboard. Teal'c enters.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
I was unable to complete my kel'no'reem. What is of such importance
that I should be summoned here immediately?
[Focus on Daniel. Flash to Teal'c in Jaffa uniform bowing in front of
him.]
DANIEL
Umm, what's this mean?
TEAL'C
I believe the closest translation would be subatomic energy
particles.
DANIEL
That's what I thought. Thank you. That's it. You can go back to
whatever you were doing.
[Teal'c leaves.]
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel is giving a presentation. Hammond, Carter, Davis and two
officials are seated around the table.]
DANIEL
Bottom line is, it's going to require the entire resources of the
entire SGC to focus on the retrieval of raw naquada for the time
being.
CARTER
Well, if we ask the Tok'ra for help...
DANIEL
Major Davis, you've prepared a budget and timetable based on the
data?
DAVIS
The Pentagon had budgeted the construction and launch of the
satellite network at $80 billion, estimated time of completion to be
two years after the start date.
DANIEL
That's unacceptable.
DAVIS
Well, if we involve the Russians in a cooperative effort...
DANIEL
No.
DAVIS
I'm sorry?
DANIEL
I said no.
DAVIS
The Russian government has agreed to stop using their Stargate on
the condition we share all information gathered by the SGC. Now we
have to tell them.
DANIEL
No we don't.
DAVIS
But...
DANIEL
It's okay. I have a way of rendering their Gate inactive.
CARTER
You do?
DAVIS
That's really not the point.
DANIEL
The point is we don't know if the Russians are turning round and
trading those secrets. This project is too important to get screwed
up by petty Earth politics. We're talking about protecting this
entire planet from Goa'uld occupation.
DAVIS
I imagine that several of the so-called petty nations of this planet
are going to be very curious when we start launching satellite
weapons into orbit two years from now.
DANIEL
One year from now.
DAVIS
That's impossible. It would double the cost.
DANIEL
Then it's not impossible, is it? Obviously most of the workload will
have to contracted out to the private sector so they'll have to be a
strategic division of labour in order to maintain the security of
the project. Major Davis, if you could also see to this.
DAVIS
What is this?
DANIEL
Just a few personal requirements. I'm sure the Pentagon will be
happy to provide me with given the nature of my continued
contributions. Please see that it gets approved as soon as possible.
Gentlemen.
[Daniel leaves.]
DAVIS
Personal requirements?
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill enters. Daniel is wearing a Goa'uld ribbon device.]
O'NEILL
Hey! What's going on? What are you doing?
DANIEL
I know exactly how this works now, but you need naquada in your
blood or you can't make it do anything.
O'NEILL
Have you considered that maybe that's a good thing?
DANIEL
Something on your mind?
O'NEILL
Your behaviour, as a matter of fact.
DANIEL
What about it?
O'NEILL
Well, for starters, who gave you the authority to give orders around
here?
DANIEL
Actually, the Pentagon. Look, maybe I haven't exactly been patient
lately, but I'm just doing what has to be done. I have the
knowledge; I have to make sure it gets used properly. Now I can
elevate us to the point of wiping out the Goa'uld or I can watch it
all go to waste.
O'NEILL
You're under a lot of pressure, I understand.
DANIEL
I recommended you to oversee the entire naquada retrieval operation.
O'NEILL
Oh yeah, thank you very much by the way. I can either accept the
position or retire!
DANIEL
Why aren't you behind me on all this? I mean, I'm finally taking
your position. Let's build weapons. Let's kick some Goa'uld ass.
Because it's me saying it, I'm suddenly a bad guy?
O'NEILL
Where's Teal'c?
[Focus on Daniel. Flash to Daniel using the ribbon device to blast
O'Neill across the room into the wall.]
DANIEL
He's on a mission.
O'NEILL
What mission?
DANIEL
The one I sent him on.
O'NEILL
When's he going to be back?
DANIEL
When he's done. Jack, I've got a lot of work to do and so do you.
So, please help me, or leave.
[O'Neill leaves.]
INT--A GOA'ULD PALACE LIT WITH FLAMING TORCHES
[Two Jaffa guards drag in Apophis.]
APOPHIS
Please have mercy. I beg you.

revealed that Daniel is standing over him using the ribbon device.]
INT--DANIEL'S BEDROOM IN A MANSION, ONE YEAR LATER
[Daniel rises from bed. He looks out of the window and sees Carter in a
car below. She is being allowed through the gates to the mansion by
security guards]
EXT--MANSION
[Carter drives through the gates and parks in the driveway.]
INT--MANSION CORRIDOR
[Daniel steps out of his bedroom to be greeted by a female ASSISTANT.]
ASSISTANT
Good morning, Dr. Jackson. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is
already waiting for your 0900 briefing. You also have a message from
Carl Smith at NASA regarding the AG's dispersement mechanism.
DANIEL
Are they on schedule yet?
ASSISTANT
No.
DANIEL
Unbelievable.
ASSISTANT
And Major Carter is here to see you.
DANIEL
Send her away.
[They walk down a staircase into an entrance hall with security
guards.]
DANIEL
And find out why she still has a valid security pass.
ASSISTANT
Right away, Dr. Jackson.
SECURITY GUARD
Good morning, Dr. Jackson.
INT--THE MANSION
[Daniel walks into the dining room.]
WOMAN
Morning, Sir.
[The woman hands Daniel a sheet of paper.]
MAID
What can I make for you this morning, Dr. Jackson?
DANIEL
I'm not hungry.
MAID
Of course.
[Shifu is seated at the table eating Froot Loops.]
SHIFU
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
DANIEL
Oma teach you that?
SHIFU
Television.
DANIEL
Glad I've been such a positive influence.
[Carter pushes her way in followed by security.]
CARTER
Daniel!
ASSISTANT
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson, she insisted.
DANIEL
It's okay.
CARTER
You can't seriously think you're going to get away with this?
DANIEL
What are you talking about, Sam?
CARTER
What you're doing--what you've got planned. That's why you had me
removed from the project. You knew I'd figure it out eventually.
DANIEL
I relieved you of your responsibilities because you were starting to
crack under the pressure. You seem to have lost all perspective.
Quite frankly, I think your jealousy finally got the best of you.
CARTER
Jealousy? I'll tell you why it's hard to maintain perspective,
Daniel. Strategic division of labour. All in an effort to stop
anyone from seeing the big picture.
[Focus on Daniel. Flash of Carter being tortured with a Goa'uld pain
stick.]
DANIEL
What exactly do you think you've figured out, Sam?
CARTER
You know damn well what I'm talking about.
[Carter looks at Shifu]
CARTER
What have you done to him?
DANIEL
You leave him out of this.
CARTER
Can't you see what you've become?
DANIEL
I didn't change, Sam. You did.
CARTER
You can't stop me from telling people what's really going on.
They'll listen. You'll never get away with this.
[Carter is dragged out of the by security.]
ASSISTANT
Is she insane?
[Daniel nods.]
INT--JAIL CELLS
[O'Neill is shown in by a guard. He approaches a cell. Carter is
inside.]
CARTER
Sir, thank you for coming.
O'NEILL
What are you doing, Carter?
CARTER
I'm trying to do what's right. I have talked to everyone I know. No
one's answering my calls, responding to my emails, even my letters.
O'NEILL
Because they think you're nuts.
CARTER
What do you think?
O'NEILL
We're talking about Daniel here. Sometimes he can be a little odd.
Every once in a while he gets carried away, but he's not going to do
anything to jeopardise the entire planet.
CARTER
I'm not so sure, Sir.
O'NEILL
There are a lot of very smart people who believe in this.
CARTER
He's got them brainwashed.
O'NEILL
Carter!
CARTER
What about Teal'c? You don't still blame Daniel for that?
O'NEILL
I couldn't prove anything. Can you?
CARTER
No. I just have my opinion. But that used to be worth something to
you.
O'NEILL
Look, Carter, you helped Daniel create these weapons.
CARTER
I know.
O'NEILL
Well, you couldn't stop it--what do you expect me to do?
CARTER
Talk to him.
INT--A CONTROL ROOM
[Daniel is watching the conversation on a huge monitor.]
CARTER
Sir, you have to try. Somebody has to stop him before it's too late.
INT--MANSION LOUNGE
[O'Neill is standing in front of a fireplace. He's playing with some
flowers when one falls to the floor. Daniel enters. O'Neill picks up
the flower and quickly puts it back into the arrangement.]
DANIEL
Jack. Nice to see you.
O'NEILL
You too. It's been a while huh? I love the place.
O'NEILL
Love what you've done with it.
DANIEL
I'm sorry I haven't kept in touch.
O'NEILL
Ahh, you've been busy.
DANIEL
Yeah. Well the truth is we couldn't have done any of this without
your help and I probably should have been more appreciative.
O'NEILL
The fruit basket was nice.
DANIEL
Can't be a coincidence you showed up here on the day of the launch.
O'NEILL
Is that today?
DANIEL
Yeah, it was supposed to be top secret.
O'NEILL
Who knew?
DANIEL
You want to stay and watch?
O'NEILL
You got a big screen?
DANIEL
Come here.
O'NEILL
Why?
DANIEL
You'll see.

What?

vanish inside it.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM/BUNKER

DANIEL
Elevators are such a pain in the ass.

consoles. Daniel crosses to a control chair and sits down.]
VOICE OVER SPEAKER
Tertiary systems are on line.
DANIEL
What do you think?
CONTROLLER 1
Commence calibration of primary sensor arrays in 5, 4, 3, 2...
O'NEILL
It's cool. Kind of like Vegas.
DANIEL
Actually, we've got three-to-one odds in favour of the launch going
off without a hitch.
O'NEILL
Hey, I'll take some of that action.
DANIEL
Put Colonel O'Neill down for a hundred.
CONTROLLER 2
Got it.
O'NEILL
Dollars, right?
DANIEL
I'm glad you're here, Jack. After what happened to Teal'c I thought
I'd never see you again.
O'NEILL
Ahh, ancient history. Besides, I didn't want to miss watching you
save the world.
DANIEL
Yeah, actually Sam thinks I'm trying to take it over.
O'NEILL
Oh, how arch.
DANIEL
Yeah.
O'NEILL
So you threw her in jail, huh?
DANIEL
She was getting dangerous. You think the military didn't take all
kinds of precautions to make sure I couldn't just control
everything.
O'br/> Ahh, so what is all this?
DANIEL
Basically a big-screen TV so we can watch and fix things if it goes
wrong.
CONTROLLER 3
Dr. Jackson? The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on channel 1.
[General Vidrine appears on a monitor.]
VIDRINE
Congratulations, Dr. Jackson. We've all worked very hard for this
day.
DANIEL
Thank you, and congratulations to you.
VIDRINE
We're a go for launch. Commencing twenty-second countdown.
MALE CONTROLLER
All systems are go. The clock is running.
DANIEL
We've got twenty-four delivery systems all launching concurrently.
Each one is carrying twelve AG3s that will disperse once they reach
orbit.

offers it to O'Neill, who declines.]
DANIEL
You sure? It's $2 thousand a bottle.
O'NEILL
No, thanks.
DANIEL
Come on, Jack, you're about to become an international hero.
O'NEILL
How do you mean?
DANIEL
Well, now that we have a way of defending ourselves against the
Goa'uld, the president is going to make the Stargate's existence
public knowledge.
MALE CONTROLLER
Dr. Jackson?
[A reporter appears on the big screen.]
REPORTER
I'm Amy Jenson, live on Capitol Hill. The president has postponed
his public address amid speculation that an international crisis is
developing over the top-secret launch of what has been called a new
cutting-edge satellite communications network. No official statement
from the White House yet. However, we assume a statement is
forthcoming.
[Daniel goes to the control chair, and Vidrine appears on the big
screen.]
DANIEL
What's going on?
VIDRINE
The Russians have gone on high alert. The Chinese are following
suit. The Russians are repositioning one of their antisatellite
weapons. Looks like they're going to try and take out one of our
AG3s.
DANIEL
Did they respond to the statement?
VIDRINE
The Russian parliament considers the secret development and
deployment of this new alien technology weapons system to be a
direct violation of prior agreements to share all information
garnered through the Stargate programme. Unless control of this
system is relinquished immediately, it will be considered an act of
aggression and will be responded to as such.
DANIEL
That's pretty much what we expected.
VIDRINE
Yes.
DANIEL
Then my advice to the president would be we have to demonstrate what
we are capable of.
VIDRINE
I have suggested that to him already, and the president agrees.
MALE CONTROLLER
Receiving authorisation to target Russian satellite.
[On the screen, we see a targeting system.]
MALE CONTROLLER
We have target lock. System is firing.
EXT--SPACE

INT--CONTROL BUNKER
MALE CONTROLLER
Target has been eliminated.
VIDRINE
Very effective. Everyone here is very impressed.
DANIEL
Let's hope the Russians are as well.
VIDRINE
We predicted their next step would be to launch more anti-satellite
weapons, and that's exactly what they're doing. I'm sure they're
moving rockets into position as we speak.
DANIEL
And your next step?
VIDRINE
We're preparing a proportional response. I'm recommending we take
out their launch site.
DANIEL
This is all leading to a full-scale nuclear attack, though, isn't
it?
VIDRINE
Unless we comply with their demands, yes, that would be a high
probability.
DANIEL
Shouldn't we just nip this in the bud?
VIDRINE
Given our new ability to defend ourselves, we don't see the need to
jump the gun. The president is currently rethinking our position on
unilateral control of the system.
DANIEL
I see.
[Daniel pushes a button. He now has override control of the defence
system.]
VIDRINE
Dr. Jackson, what are you doing?
DANIEL
As I suspected, the president is obviously failing to overcome a
lack of necessary leadership abilities. So I'm going to have to step
in and prevent a global nuclear war.
[O'Neill is sitting on a raised platform watching the events.]
VIDRINE
You're not supposed to be able to do this. You can't do this.
DANIEL
I've already done this. This bunker is well protected. Don't even
think about sending a cruise missile our way.
VIDRINE
Dr. Jackson!
[Daniel turns off the communication.]
DANIEL
I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had about enough of
that guy.
[O'Neill stands up.]
O'NEILL
Daniel. What are you doing?
DANIEL
Proportional response only makes sense when the playing field is
even. We have a distinct advantage here. Problem is the other side
just doesn't realise how wide the gap is. What they really need is a
visual aid.
MALE CONTROLLER
AG system targeting Moscow.
O'NEILL
Daniel.
DANIEL
Don't worry, there's no threat of residual radiation spreading. It's
quick and clean--it's like cutting your enemy's heart out with a
scalpel.
[O'Neill pulls out a gun and shoots at Daniel. A Goa'uld force field
protects him from the bullets. Daniel looks disappointed.]
DANIEL
Don't you think it was strange you got through security with a
loaded gun?
O'NEILL
A little.
DANIEL
You never were that bright.
O'NEILL
No.
EXT--SPACE
[Several weapons all turn to one target.]
O'NEILL
Daniel, think about one thing before you do this. We never proved
that kid was a Harcesis.
DANIEL
What are you talking about?
O'NEILL
Everything he put in your head. The Goa'uld have used mind control
before.
DANIEL
You think this is some elaborate Goa'uld plot to get me to destroy
the world?
O'NEILL
We've seen them use kids too.
DANIEL
They used Shifu to put a bunch of stuff into my head in order to get
me to build the weapons, only to eventually turn them on Earth?
O'NEILL
It's possible.
DANIEL
There's only one flaw in that theory. You're assuming this is not
what I wanted all along.
O'NEILL
Don't. Don't.
MALE CONTROLLER
System is firing.
[We see Moscow being destroyed.]
MALE CONTROLLER
Target has been eliminated.
[O'Neill and Daniel look at one another.]
FADE TO BLACK
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[O'Neill and Fraiser are standing next to a bed. Daniel is still
unconscious on the bed.]
O'NEILL
Still nothing?
FRAISER
No. There's nothing physically wrong with him--or at least anything
I can find.
O'NEILL
Except for the fact that he's in a coma.
FRAISER
It's not really a coma. He still has rapid eye movement.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Teal'c, Carter, O'Neill and Hammond are seated around the table. The
Tok'ra Aldwin is standing.]
ALDWIN
The fact is, he may not be the Harcesis at all.
HAMMOND
Are you saying this could be some sort of Goa'uld trick?
TEAL'C
As we have seen, General Hammond, the Goa'uld are not above using
human children as weapons.
CARTER
Well, all Shifu would say is that he is teaching Daniel.
O'NEILL
So what do we do?
ALDWIN
As you know, the zatarc detector's original purpose was to detect
deception. We could at the very least determine whether the boy is
actually Harcesis and possibly what he did to Dr. Jackson.
CARTER
Basically a lie detector test.
ALDWIN
No harm would come to him.
O'NEILL
And what--just hope he doesn't explode in the meantime?
ALDWIN
Hope he really is who he says he is.
HAMMOND
Maybe help Dr. Jackson?
INT--SGC, LAB
[Carter carefully straps Shifu into the detector chair. Teal'c is
present. O'Neill and Hammond watch from the observation room.]
CARTER
It's just a precaution. I had this done to me once and I had to wear
them too.
SHIFU
The mind is always free.
[Aldwin holds the memory disk next to Shifu's head.]
ALDWIN
This will hurt a little. After that I promise you will feel no pain.
I will merely ask you some questions.
SHIFU
Questions are plentiful. Answers are few.
ALDWIN
We'll try and keep it simple. Ready?
[Aldwin goes to the machine.]
ALDWIN
Direct your vision here. First question, what is your name?
SHIFU
Shifu.
ALDWIN
Are you Harcesis?
SHIFU
I am many things.
ALDWIN
Do you possess the genetic knowledge passed on to you by Apophis?
SHIFU
Yes.
CARTER
What did you do to Daniel?
SHIFU
Dreams sometimes teach. I am teaching him.
CARTER
Teaching him what?
SHIFU
That the true nature of a man is determined in the battle between
his conscious mind and his subconscious and that the evil in my
subconscious is too strong to resist.
[Daniel enters.]
DANIEL
The only way to win is to deny it battle.
SHIFU
As Oma teaches.
[Fraiser enters the observation room.]
FRAISER
He woke up a few minutes ago.
DANIEL
One of these days, I'm going to figure out she's worth listening to.
CARTER
What happened?
DANIEL
I was having a dream.
CARTER
About what?
DANIEL
That's not really important. The important thing is it's time I
chose a new path.
SHIFU
And it is time for me to continue on mine.
ALDWIN
Wait a minute--if he really is Harcesis...
DANIEL
He is.
ALDWIN
We can still extract some very valuable information from him.
DANIEL
No, you can't.
ALDWIN
I don't understand.
DANIEL
I know.
SHIFU
Thank you for telling me of my mother.
DANIEL
She would have been very proud of you.
SHIFU
Of you as well.
DANIEL
Will I see you again?
SHIFU
All roads eventually lead to the great path.
DANIEL
Eventually.
SHIFU
Many cross on the way.
ALDWIN
What's going on? We're not just going to let him leave?
CARTER
I don't think we have a choice.
[Shifu becomes a light/energy being and floats out of the infirmary.
Daniel, Carter and Teal'c follow.]
INT--OBSERVATION ROOM
[Red alert is sounding in the background.]
O'NEILL
General, I highly recommend you order all personnel to stand down
and get the heck out of the way.
HAMMOND
Are you sure, Colonel?
O'NEILL
The alternative might not be so pretty.
[O'Neill leaves.]
HAMMOND
What am I supposed to say?
[Hammond speaks into a microphone.]
HAMMOND
All personnel, this is General Hammond. A glowing energy being is
headed for Level 28. We believe it is heading for the Gate room.
Lower your weapons and do not attempt to intercept it.
INT--CORRIDOR
[SFs lower their weapons as the energy being passes.]
[O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c enter the control room. The Gate
has dialled and the wormhole is visible.]
TECH DAVIS
The Gate just opened, Sir.
[The light being enters the Gate room. More SFs put down their weapons.
On the ramp it solidifies a little into Shifu. Shifu turns and waves at
Daniel. Daniel waves back. Shifu goes through the Gate. The Gate shuts
down. O'Neill looks at Daniel, who looks upset but peaceful.]
