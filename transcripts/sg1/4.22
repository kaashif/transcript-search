FLASHBACK
SCENE FROM "CROSSROADS"
TANITH
I am Tanith. It is my honour to pledge my allegiance to the Tok'ra.
SCENE FROM "CROSSROADS"
ANISE
If we allow Tanith to believe he has deceived us, we will be able to
use that against the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
Disinformation?
ANISE
Yes.
SCENE FROM "CROSSROADS"
TANITH
I hope one day we will meet again, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
You have my promise.
FLASHBACK
[Cronus killing Teal'c's father.]
SCENE FROM "SERPENT'S VENOM"
CARTER
So what now?
SELMAK
Apophis will easily absorb Heru'ur's forces into his own. He is now
a bigger threat than ever before.
SCENE FROM "DOUBLE JEOPARDY"
DARIEN
Apophis came in his ship and declared that our planet now fell under
his domain. He commanded that we worship him.
CARTER
What do we do with the other Jaffa once we've dealt with Cronus and
taken over the ship?
[Firefight for Cronus' mothership, Teal'c killing Cronus.]
O'NEILL
Go tell your people Cronus is dead.
EXT--SPACE, PLANET VORASH.
[A Goa'uld mother ship heading for Planet Vorash]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[There are Tok'ra moving through the tunnels.]
TANITH
What is happening?
FEMALE Tok'ra 1
Defence systems picked up a mothership entering orbit.
TANITH
We must evacuate immediately.
FEMALE Tok'ra 1
We have been expecting it.
[The transporter rings deposit O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, Teal'c and
Jacob in the tunnels.]
O'NEILL
Hey kids! We're not parked in a red zone are we?
OPENING TITLES
INT--TUNNELS
[O'Neill, Teal'c and Jacob are walking through the tunnel.]
TEAL'C
Tanith was surprised to see us.
JACOB
Uh huh. We didn't want to give him any warning.
O'NEILL
Doesn't suspect you're on to him?
JACOB
Not that we know of. We'll see soon enough.
TEAL'C
Of what do you speak?
JACOB
Well, thanks to the mothership you're so graciously lending us.
O'NEILL
Not me. Hammond. It was an order remember?
JACOB
Well anyway, we'll be able to move the Stargate to a new planet not
currently on the Goa'uld map. We'll finally be able to ensure the
security of a more permanent Tok'ra base. As useful as Tanith has
been in relaying false information to Apophis, we can't afford to
take him with us.
TEAL'C
What will become of him?
JACOB
We have a little surprise planned. Shall we?
INT--TOK'RA COUNCIL ROOM
[Jacob, O'Neill and Teal'c enter. Several Tok'ra and Tanith are already
seated around a table inside.]
FEMALE TOK'RA 1
Colonel O'Neill. Teal'c. Allow me to welcome you and your team back
to Vorash. High Counsellor Per'sus sends his greetings.
O'NEILL
Always a pleasure.
TANITH
I must say, Colonel, I was most intrigued by your means of arrival.
O'NEILL
Yeah, it's a sweet ride. A little rusty but it's still got zip.
TANITH
How exactly did a Goa'uld mothership come into your possession?
O'NEILL
Well it was kind of a trade deal.
TANITH
How so?
O'NEILL
Cronus gave us his ship and he got what was coming to him.
TANITH
Really? Cronus is dead?
SELMAK
Now that we have access to a mothership, we will be able to move our
people and our Stargate as well and thereby establish a completely
new and secure base.
TANITH
I don't understand. Why have I been excluded from such important
information?
TEAL'C
The Tok'ra did not wish Apophis to be informed.
SELMAK
We've been aware of your duplicity from the beginning. You deceived
and then murdered the Jaffa Sha'nauc. You took the host Hebron and
you've been acting as a spy amongst us ever since.
TEAL'C
You have been used to channel disinformation to Apophis. He will
most be most displeased when he learns the truth.
TANITH
This is absurd.
[Tanith attempts to leave but is immediately stopped by two Tok'ra with
zats.]
TANITH
You will never escape. The System Lords will hunt you down to the
ends of the galaxy.
[Tanith is led out by Tok'ra.]
O'NEILL
That guy is a living clich.
INT--TOK'RA ROOM BEING USED AS A CELL
[Teal'c enters. There are two Tok'ra guards.]
TEAL'C
I wish to speak to the prisoner.
[One of the guards lowers the shield to Tanith's cell. Teal'c steps
inside.]
TANITH
I wasn't aware I was allowed guests. How kind of you to come visit
me Teal'c.
TEAL'C
My presence here is not motivated by kindness. I am here to deliver
your sentence as decreed by the Tok'ra High Council.
TANITH
Death I suppose?
TEAL'C
You are to be extracted from the host Hebron and left behind here on
Vorash. If you are fortunate, you will die before Apophis discovers
how you have been used by the Tok'ra.
TANITH
I am sure that you would like to kill me with your bare hands as I
did to your beloved Sha'nauc. You of all would appreciate how much
more satisfying it is to see the fear and pain in the eyes of your
victim as they die.
TEAL'C
You took great pleasure in the murder of Sha'nauc. But you must
understand the price you paid. While Apophis was being diverted by
your unwitting deception the Tok'ra were able to move freely through
Goa'uld territory untouched. Rescuing stranded agents, freeing
captured allies. Hundreds of lives were saved by the false
information you spread. The Tok'ra owe you a debt of gratitude
Tanith. Were it not for the relative ease with which you allowed
yourself to be manipulated, Apophis may have eliminated the Tok'ra.
TANITH
All they have done is win a respite. Inevitably the Tok'ra/Tau'ri
alliance will fall and so many others.
TEAL'C
Not by any action of yours. I will watch you die like all of the
other false Gods whose demise I have witnessed. Sokar, Seth, Hathor,
Heru'ur, Cronus.
TANITH
I am sure they died with more honour than Sha'nauc. She cried out
for you like a baby weeps for its mother, as I slowly extinguished
her life.
TEAL'C
You are attempting to goad me into killing you, thereby avoiding the
extraction process. I understand it to be excruciatingly painful for
the symbiote.
TANITH
I am far more valuable to you alive than dead.
TEAL'C
The Tok'ra do not believe so and I am inclined to agree.
[Teal'c leaves the cell.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP
[Jacob and O'Neill are walking through the ship. Tok'ra are moving
cargo around the ship.]
JACOB
You'll have to take that to the secondary cargo hold, we need to
room for the Stargate.
O'NEILL
Hey! Don't scuff the walls. I want this ship back the way we found
it.
JACOB
We know, Jack. I still don't think it's really necessary for you to
be here.
O'NEILL
Sorry, not letting her out of my sight.
JACOB
My mission is to oversee the relocation of the Tok'ra base. What's
yours again?
O'NEILL
Protect Earth's big fat asset. We've got about a thousand engineers
and scientists just drooling to go through this thing.
JACOB
You really think that's wise?
O'NEILL
Don't start with me Jacob.
JACOB
Remember when you tried to retrofit a death glider?
O'NEILL
Yes, I have that memory.
JACOB
This is a vastly more complicated piece of technology.
O'NEILL
Which is exactly why we're loaning it to you in exchange for flying
lessons.
JACOB
You know what I mean. You should really leave the ship with us.
O'NEILL
Not a chance.
JACOB
This is me talking, Jack--Jacob, not Selmac. You have no idea how
dangerous this thing is.
O'NEILL
Hey! We were smart enough to steal it in the first place which is
more than the Tok'ra have been able to do.
JACOB
We don't operate that way.
O'NEILL
Well maybe it's time you took a more direct approach. The Tok'ra
have been around for what, two thousand years? In all that time how
many System Lords have you taken down?
JACOB
Oh yeah, things have certainly gotten better out here since you
started killing Goa'ulds off one by one. Lets examine the results,
in each case more warlike Goa'ulds have stepped in to fill their
place. There's more chaos than ever before. With the power Apophis
now has we are on the brink of losing any chance of ever defeating
the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
At least we're doing something.
JACOB
Yeah well we're doing something as well, maybe our plan is a little
more long term but at least we have one.
O'NEILL
What plan?
JACOB
Undermine the Goa'ulds individual power and keep them fighting
amongst themselves until we have a way of eliminating them. Once and
for all.
O'NEILL
Go on.
JACOB
We're working on it, Jack.
INT--TANITH'S 'CELL'
[Tanith approaches the invisible shield and starts to talk to one of
the Tok'ra Guards.]
TANITH
You think you can save my host Hebron by separating him from me? I
will not allow you to kill me. Hebron's life is in my hands. If I am
to die he will die with me.
[Tanith closes his eyes and collapses to the ground, as if in seizure.
The Tok'ra guard speaks into a communication device.]
TOK'RA GUARD 1
The prisoner just collapsed.
[A female Tok'ra arrives.]
FEMALE TOK'RA 1
Lower the shield. Lower the shield! We cannot just stand by and
allow him to kill the host.
[The shield is lowered. One of the Tok'ra guards enters the cell. The
second Tok'ra guard raises his zat as the first checks Tanith's pulse.]
TOK'RA GUARD 1
He's already dead.
[Tanith suddenly raises a hand to choke the Tok'ra guard.]
INT--TOK'RA COUNCIL ROOM
[Carter, Teal'c, Daniel and O'Neill are seated around the table with
several Tok'ra]
CARTER
We've finished loading the supplies onto the ship. It's time to
start transporting your people up.
Tok'ra
We will begin immediately.
[Sound of an alarm. Jacob enters in a hurry.]
JACOB
It's Tanith. He's escaped.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
[Tanith runs along the top of a sand dune, drops to his knees and
starts to dig. He unburies a small, wrapped communication device.]
EXT--PLANET SURFACE, DIFFERENT LOCATION
[Teal'c is surveying the sand dunes. O'Neill and a couple of Tok'ra are
with him.]
TEAL'C
Tanith could not have escaped through the Stargate. It has been
heavily guarded the entire time.
O'NEILL
Yeah, what by the same guys who were guarding him in the first
place? No offence.
TEAL'C
He is out here somewhere.
O'NEILL
Ahh well he's boned without water.
TEAL'C
The symbiote will sustain him for a considerable time.
O'NEILL
Big desert.
TEAL'C
I will continue looking.
O'NEILL
Keep in touch.
[The Tok'ra head back to stand in the location of the ring transporter.
O'Neill follows them.]
O'NEILL
So how do you guys know where to stand anyway?
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[Daniel greets O'Neill and the Tok'ra as they transport down.]
DANIEL
Any sign of him?
O'NEILL
Nope, he's still looking.
DANIEL
You guys have been up there for hours already.
O'NEILL
Yeah, it's a Jaffa revenge thing.
INT--TOK'RA COUNCIL ROOM
[Daniel and O'Neill enter. Carter and Jacob are seated inside.]
JACOB
It seems Tanith's been busy. We've received word from one of our
operatives that Apophis has been given our location.
DANIEL
I guess he's trying to make up for the last few months.
JACOB
An attack fleet is being assembled.
O'NEILL
How long will it take him to get here?
JACOB
Less than a day.
DANIEL
We have to speed up the evacuation.
CARTER
We're going to send them through the Gate.
O'NEILL
I thought we were going to take 'em on the ship?
JACOB
Sam and I have come up with a new plan.
CARTER
If it works we may be able to wipe out a significant part of
Apophis' fleet in one shot.
[Carter activates a device on the table that projects a
three-dimensional representation of a sun into the air above the
table.]
JACOB
This is a sun that Vorash is orbiting. It's a regular main sequence
star with a core temperature of about 15 million degrees and enough
hydrogen to burn for another five billion years.
O'NEILL
Yeah?
JACOB
We wanna blow it up.
O'NEILL
Wow.
DANIEL
That's err...
O'NEILL AND DANIEL
...ambitious.
CARTER
Every star is a delicate balance between the explosive force of the
fusion going on in it's core which tends to want to blow it apart
and the gravitational force of it's mass which tends to want to
crush it into a little ball. Now if we could disrupt that balance by
suddenly removing some of the star's mass we could create an
artificial supernova. The blast wave would expand at nearly the
speed of light. It would destroy everything in this system within a
matter of minutes.
DANIEL
Erm...how are we supposed to remove some of the star's mass?
CARTER
Well...err...this is going to sound a little crazy but we dial P3W
451, it's the planet where we encountered the black hole.
O'NEILL
Wow. That sounds a little crazy.
CARTER
Yeah.
JACOB
We take the Stargate in the mothership and bring it as close to the
sun as we can. Then we dial the black hole, enclose the Gate in a
force field and jettison it.
CARTER
The suns gravity will pull it in, the force field will disintegrate
and stellar matter will be sucked through that wormhole like water
through a fire hose.
JACOB
It's likely the Gate won't last long but we figure it'll be long
enough.
DANIEL
Ah, excuse me, but wasn't the Gate on P3W 451 sucked into the black
hole a long time ago?
CARTER
Not necessarily. That planet was probably ripped to pieces but it
could take years for that matter to spiral into the event horizon
especially given the time distortion.
JACOB
Either way we'll know as soon as we try to dial out. If we can't
make a connection, we abort the plan and get the hell out of there.
O'NEILL
Well, let me think about this a moment.
JACOB
You're the one who wanted to take more direct measures, Jack. The
Council's already approved the plan. But it's your ship, which means
it's your call.
O'NEILL
Still thinking.
CARTER
Sir, this solar system is completely abandoned and barren. Apophis'
fleet is on the way. Now we may never have an opportunity like this
again.
O'NEILL
Okay.
INT--ANOTHER TOK'RA ROOM
[Teal'c is seated at a table. Daniel enters]
DANIEL
Hey Teal'c. I've been looking for you. There's been a change of
plans.
TEAL'C
I have been informed of Major Carter's intentions.
DANIEL
So you understand then that there's nowhere for Tanith to run? This
whole planet is going to be incinerated.
TEAL'C
If all goes according to plan, yes.
DANIEL
Well you don't think we can pull it off?
TEAL'C
I have great confidence in both Selmac and Major Carter.
DANIEL
But?
TEAL'C
Twice I have had the opportunity to avenge the murder of Sha'nauc.
Twice I have let Tanith slip through my grasp. I have failed
Sha'nauc.
DANIEL
That's...that's not true. You let Tanith live so the Tok'ra could
use him and it worked. And now we're about to take down Apophis and
the largest Goa'uld fleet ever assembled.
TEAL'C
It will be a great victory.
DANIEL
That's right.
TEAL'C
And yet knowing what Apophis did to Sha'uri would you not trade it
all for the opportunity to crush the life from his throat with your
bare hands?
DANIEL
Well, I'd be lying to you if I said I'd never thought about it but
that doesn't mean I'd do it, given a more rational option.
TEAL'C
In the future I will not be capable of such restraint.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP
[O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c walk down a corridor and into the flight
deck. Jacob is at the helm.]
CARTER
The last of the Tok'ra have been evacuated and the Stargate's been
loaded into the cargo bay. We're good to go.
[O'Neill turns and sees the throne. He runs over and jumps excitedly
onto to it, holding out his legs like a little boy. Daniel and Teal'c
stare at his antics.]
O'NEILL
Ooh. Shotgun.
[Jacob activates the engines.]
JACOB
Setting course for the sun. I'm picking up the fleet on long range
scanners. At current speed they'll be here in 68 minutes.
CARTER
The timing has to be precise. Once we're close enough to the sun
we'll slow to five percent light speed and release the Gate. That
should give us more than enough time to get away.
O'NEILL
How much advance warning is Apophis going to have?
JACOB
They won't be able to detect the Gate on their screens and they
won't know Vorash is deserted until they're in orbit. By then it'll
be too late.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, CARGO HOLD
[The Stargate is in a separate section of the hold separated from the
controls by a viewing window. O'Neill and Carter start to dial up the
Gate using the remote controls.]
JACOB
(over speaker)
We're in position. Slowing to five percent light speed.
CARTER
Cargo bay's gravity generators at maximum. Initiating remote
dial-out sequence.
JACOB
Ready when you are.
[The Gate dials out.]
CARTER
It worked. The Gate on P3W 451 is still active. Engaging force
field.
[A force field appears around the Gate.]
O'NEILL
Something wrong?
CARTER
No. I've just never blown up a star before.
O'NEILL
Well they say the first one's always the hardest. They say that.
CARTER
Opening cargo bay doors. Releasing the clamps. And the Gate is away.
EXT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, OUTSIDE CARGO HOLD
[Tumbling gently, the Stargate floats out of the cargo bay and into
space.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK.
[Jacob, Teal'c and Daniel are standing around the Pel'tak controls.]
JACOB
Gate trajectory on course. All right, time to go. Prepare for
hyperspeed.
EXT--SHOT
[We see a Goa'uld scout ship suddenly de-cloak and start firing at the
mothership.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
DANIEL
What the hell's that?
[O'Neill and Carter enter.]
O'NEILL
What the hell was that?
JACOB
We're under attack. Teal'c, weapons.
TEAL'C
moves to the weapons console which appears from out of the floor.
TEAL'C
Shields are inoperative.
JACOB
It can't be Apophis, it's too soon.
TEAL'C
Acquiring target. It is an Alkesh. A Goa'uld mid-range bomber.
JACOB
It must have been cloaked.
TEAL'C
Weapons are charged. Returning fire.
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership fires as the Goa'uld bomber flies over it, returning
fire.]
JACOB
She's too quick. Here she comes again Teal'c.
EXT--SPACE
[The mothership fires as the Goa'uld bomber flies over it, returning
fire.]
[The lights fade out. The engine noise fades.]
O'NEILL
Jacob?
JACOB
We've lost main power. Hyperdrive is down. We're sitting ducks.
DANIEL
Why haven't they finished us off?
JACOB
They took a direct hit, they might be just as damaged as we are.
O'NEILL
Hey, who's 'they' anyway?
JACOB
I have no idea.
TEAL'C
Tactical indicators are down.
O'NEILL
Weapons?
TEAL'C
Inoperable.
JACOB
I have to go check it out.
O'NEILL
Hey! Whoa! We've still got an enemy ship out there.
CARTER
Sir, when that Gate reaches the sun...
O'NEILL
It's not going to make any difference if we get blown out of the
sky.
JACOB
What do you want us to do, Jack? We have no weapons or shields.
O'NEILL
Gliders. This ship's got gliders, right?
JACOB
Of course.
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[Teal'c follows O'Neill out of the flight deck.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, CORRIDOR
[Teal'c and O'Neill running along.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Glider heads for the Goa'uld bomber ship.]
TEAL'C
The Alkesh has an significant advantage in both size and armaments.
O'NEILL
Hey nice pre-flight there.
TEAL'C
However we have superior manoeuvrability.
O'NEILL
All right there she is.
TEAL'C
Jacob was right. The ship appears to have been damaged.
O'NEILL
Let's put her out of misery. Powering weapons.
[The Goa'uld bomber ship suddenly ignites engines and flies off.]
O'NEILL
What the hell?
TEAL'C
They appear to have repaired their engines.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
Jack? What's happening out there?
O'NEILL
(over radio)
They're breaking off.
JACOB
So let them go.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
TEAL'C
O'Neill, the ship appears to be heading for Vorash.
[Teal'c pilots the glider after the Goa'uld bomber.]
O'NEILL
Ahh, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
We must not allow Tanith to escape.
O'NEILL
Um...
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Teal'c thinks the ship might be going to pick up Tanith.
JACOB
That makes sense, Jack. He probably had his ship waiting in a nearby
system the whole time. That's why they got here so fast.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
Yeah well seems we're going after him.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
DANIEL
It's a Jaffa revenge thing.
CARTER
Sir, you only have a little more than an hour.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
O'NEILL
Ahh Carter relax. We'll be back in plenty of time. Right Teal'c,
we'll be back in plenty of time? Buddy? Pal? Oh God...
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
Sam, I'm going to need your help with the hyperdrive. Dr. Jackson,
you have the pel'tac.
DANIEL
Ahh...what...what, what exactly does that mean?
JACOB
We'll stay in touch.
EXT--SPACE. THE GLIDER CHASES THE BOMBER TOWARD VORASH.
INT--GLIDER COCKPIT
TEAL'C
Target is in range.
O'NEILL
Weapons locked. Here we go.
EXT--SPACE. THE GLIDER FIRES AND THE BOMBER STARTS TO FIRE BACK.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
[Tanith walks onto the dunes. He sees the fire fight going on in the
sky above him. The glider's fire hits the bomber and it starts to break
up as it heads for the planet's surface. Tanith starts to run as the
bomber explodes.]
O'NEILL
Pull up Teal'c. Teal'c pull up!
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Mayday, mayday. We are so going in.
DANIEL
Jack, can you hear me? Jack, I'm not reading you. What's happening?
Jack?
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, POWER ROOM
[The lights come up.]
JACOB
Main power's back on line. Weapons and shields are operational.
CARTER
What about the hyperdrive?
JACOB
The control circuit is fried. The engines themselves are fine but
we're going to have to re-route through secondary systems.
CARTER
Well how long will that take?
JACOB
We'll have to move fast.
DANIEL
(over speaker)
Sam?
CARTER
Go ahead.
DANIEL
I just got a mayday from Jack.
CARTER
What's going on?
DANIEL
I don't know, I lost the transmission.
CARTER
Hang on. We have to go back for them.
JACOB
We can't. Not now.
CARTER
Why not? We have sub-light speed.
JACOB
I know but I'm the only one that can fly this ship and I have to
stay here and make these repairs.
CARTER
Well I'll do them.
JACOB
Sam...
CARTER
We're not leaving them behind. You can talk me through it.
JACOB
Okay. You can start by pulling out the burnt crystals.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
[The glider has crashed. Teal'c climbs to the top of a dune away from
the wreckage. O'Neill is standing looking at the view.]
TEAL'C
The propulsion system and communication array have been damaged
beyond repair.
O'NEILL
Ah that's good because according to my calculations we are roughly
in the middle of...nowhere. Give or take.
TEAL'C
The cruiser was on its way to pick up Tanith. Therefore we cannot be
far from the Tok'ra base. If we can make it there, Major Carter and
Daniel Jackson can ring us aboard the mothership.
O'NEILL
You're assuming they're assuming we're alive and they're coming back
for us of course.
TEAL'C
Care to make a wager O'Neill?
O'NEILL
On which part?
TEAL'C
I believe it is this way.
O'NEILL
This is so the last time I help someone move.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
Good, the tactical display came back on line.
DANIEL
Yeah, I think we have a problem here. I figure that flashing wasn't
good news, and the fact that in Goa'uld it says 'Warning, Warning'.
JACOB
It's Apophis. He's here.
EXT--SPACE
[Several Goa'uld ships including a large mothership drop out of
hyperspace.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
He's a little ahead of schedule. The other ship must have warned him
to pick up the pace.
DANIEL
What are you doing?
JACOB
Retreating.
DANIEL
Yeah, what about Jack and Teal'c?
JACOB
Apophis' ships are taking up attack positions around Vorash, he'd
destroy us before we even got close. I'm not going to abandon them
Daniel. We need to buy more time. If we move around behind the sun,
the fleet won't spot us.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
[O'Neill and Teal'c are walking over the sand dunes.]
O'NEILL
Ah this is a bad idea. I said that remember. Remember I said,
General this is a bad idea.
TEAL'C
I remember O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Let the Tok'ra get their own ship I said. They don't share with us,
why should we share with them?
TEAL'C
I remember.
O'NEILL
Yep, that's what I said.
TEAL'C
How much time remains before the sun explodes O'Neill?
O'NEILL
Huh, oh 45 minutes.
TEAL'C
Then at least we have prevented Tanith from escaping.
O'NEILL
Yes, at least we have that.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE, A DIFFERENT DUNE
[Two Jaffa are transported by rings down to the planet's surface.
Tanith is waiting for them.]
JAFFA 1
Apophis sends his greetings and bids you welcome upon his vessel. He
is grateful for your service.
TANITH
There may still be one more thing for which he can be grateful.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
CARTER
(over speaker)
Okay, now what?
JACOB
Replace the last two crystals. The whole panel should light up and
you should hear a hum.
CARTER
Humming away. Hyperdrive's on line.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
O'NEILL
Yeah, should be around here somewhere.
TEAL'C
Indeed. The rings are centred here.
O'NEILL
So, now what?
[Suddenly, a Jaffa shoots Teal'c in the back with a staff weapon. He
falls as O'Neill tries to catch him. Jaffa continues to fire. O'Neill
pulls his P90 as he lowers Teal'c to the ground. He runs from cover
behind a dune and fires at the Jaffa, hitting him. A second Jaffa fires
at O'Neill with a zat and O'Neill collapses back to the sand but fires
at the second Jaffa. second Jaffa rolls down the dune. O'Neill starts
to get up as the ring transporter picks up Tanith and Teal'c. O'Neill
fires at them but the bullets strike the rings before Tanith and Teal'c
vanish.]
EXT--SPACE.
[The Stargate descends into the sun.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[Carter enters.]
JACOB
The Stargate just entered the sun.
CARTER
We only have twenty-seven minutes before it goes supernova. Why
aren't we heading back to Vorash?
JACOB
Apophis is already there, there's no way we're going to get near
that planet.
CARTER
But we have to do something.
JACOB
Apophis wants the Tok'ra, so let's give them to him.
INT--APOPHIS' MOTHERSHIP, CONTROL DECK
[Tanith and two Jaffa stand before Apophis.]
APOPHIS
You are injured?
TANITH
I will be fine.
APOPHIS
Where are the Tok'ra?
TANITH
The attempt to stop their ship was thwarted however I have managed
to procure a gift which will make the journey seem worthwhile.
[Two more Jaffa drag a 'dead' Teal'c in and dump him at Apophis' feet.]
APOPHIS
The shol'va. You have done well.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, CONTROL DECK
JACOB
Remote guidance engaged. Launching gliders.
EXT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP
[Gliders launch]
INT--APOPHIS'S MOTHERSHIP, CONTROL DECK
JAFFA 1
Lord Apophis. Scanners have picked up a fleet of gliders
APOPHIS
Surround them.
JAFFA 1
The fleet is on course. They are heading out of the system. Speed
increasing.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
He's taking the bait. The fleet is leaving Vorash.
INT--APOPHIS'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JAFFA 1
We are approaching the enemy ships. My Lord, there are no life
signs, the ships are unmanned.
APOPHIS
A trick.
JAFFA 1
Sensors are picking up a ha'tak now approaching the planet.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
Less than 4 minutes before the sun begins to supernova.
EXT--PLANET SURFACE
DANIEL
(over radio)
Jack, come in. Jack, come in.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I'm here. Hey, thanks for checking in.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Yeah, we had a little trouble avoiding Apophis' fleet. Are you in
position to be ringed up?
O'NEILL
Yeah, I s'pose. I don't know.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Jack, if you're not in position...
O'NEILL
Daniel, just get me the hell out of here will ya?
[O'Neill looks nervous as the ring transporter surrounds him.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
We got to get out of here.
CARTER
If my calculations were correct...
EXT--SPACE
[The sun explodes, engulfing Vorash and heading for Apophis' fleet.]
INT--APOPHIS'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
APOPHIS
Arm the weapons.
JAFFA
My Lord.
EXT--SPACE
[Apophis' ships are being wiped out by the supernova.]
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
JACOB
Engaging hyperdrive.
INT--SGC'S MOTHERSHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[The ship goes into Hyperspeed. Suddenly, it is thrown out of
Hyperspeed.]
CARTER
What just happened?
JACOB
We must have caught the tail end of the blast wave. It knocked us
off course.
[O'Neill and Daniel enter.]
CARTER
Sir. Where's Teal'c?
O'NEILL
I'm not sure. I think he's dead.
JACOB
If Apophis has him...
CARTER
Well, we have to go back.
JACOB
That may not be possible, Sam. The navigational computer isn't
recognising any of the star patterns. According to these readings
we've travelled over four million light years.
CARTER
That's impossible.
JACOB
We're not even in our own galaxy anymore.
CARTER
Well the explosion must have somehow affected the subspace window
created by the hyperdrive.
O'NEILL
Wait...wait a minute, what are you saying? We can't get back?
JACOB
I don't know. The ship isn't normally capable of going so fast.
O'NEILL
It only took us a few seconds to get here.
JACOB
Given our current position, and maximum hyperdrive speed, it's going
to take us 125 years to get back. Long range sensors are picking up
another ship. It's Apophis...
TO BE CONTINUED...
