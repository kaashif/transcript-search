TITLE
Serpent's Venom
TEASER
EXT--CHULAK, A VILLAGE, NIGHT
INT--TENT
[A child runs in. There is a Serpent Guard, Ma'kar, inside.]
CHILD
Father, he's coming!
MA'KAR
Yes, I know. You are not to be here.
CHILD
But, Father...
MA'KAR
Go! Now!
[The child leaves. He meets Teal'c at the entrance to the tent. Teal'c
enters and lowers the hood on his clock.]
MA'KAR
After all this time, it is really you.
TEAL'C
Ma'kar of the Gomai Foothills.
RAK'NOR
Teal'c.
[We see the Jaffa Rak'nor. Rak'nor has had his gold serpent guard
tattoo removed. It has left a scar.]
TEAL'C
You are the one called Rak'nor.
RAK'NOR
It is an honour to finally meet you.
TEAL'C
And I, you.
MA'KAR
We have heard much of your return to Chulak.
TEAL'C
It is time for Jaffa to stop whispering about freedom, and begin to
show our true power.
MA'KAR
A power we can only hope is greater than that of the Gods.
TEAL'C
False gods.
MA'KAR
Their power is real, and stronger than ever. Even Heru'ur, and the
other System Lords fear Apophis. He commands the vast army of Sokar.
TEAL'C
An army of Jaffa.
MA'KAR
You know of what happened here on Chulak at the hands of Apophis.
TEAL'C
Yes, I know how many were slaughtered. But I also know that those
left alive are ready to rise against him. The Jaffa are the
foundation upon which the false Gods have built their empires. We
can tear them down.
RAK'NOR
To do so, we will have to fight our own kind.
TEAL'C
As the Goa'uld have forced us to do in their names for countless
generations. Only now, we will fight for the freedom of all Jaffa.
MA'KAR
Rak'nor has the loyalty of a great many here on Chulak.
TEAL'C
So Bra'tac has heard from you and I from him. It is the word of our
friend Ma'kar that has brought me here this night. In their hearts
many Jaffa believe as we do. Those with the strength and the courage
must speak out. We must fear the Goa'uld no longer. Those who wish
to join our cause must be united. Kol'na of the High Cliffs and
Hak'nor of the Cordai Plains have already agreed to meet at the
Chapa Groves tomorrow.
RAK'NOR
Then I will...meet with them as well. And this...blasphemous
rebellion will finally be crushed. Ha'shak Kree!
[Teal'c stands. Another Jaffa appears in the entrance of the tent. The
Jaffa shoots Teal'c with a zat. Teal'c falls.]
MA'KAR
Shol'va!
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Sound of klaxons. The Gate is dialling. Hammond, Carter and Jacob
hurry down the stairs from the briefing room. The Stargate opens.]
TECH
Receiving IDC transmission. It's the Tok'ra.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
CARTER
Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
Too bad.
TECH
There's no traveller en route, Sir, however there's a transmission
being sent.
JACOB
Looks like my vacation is over.
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Carter, Daniel, Jacob and O'Neill are listening to a taped Goa'uld
transmission being played back.]
JACOB
Thanks to our good friend, Tanith, we were able to intercept this
conversation between Apophis and Heru'ur. It took place less than an
hour ago.
DANIEL
Sounds like they've agreed to meet.
SELMAK
Currently, Heru'ur is aligned with the System Lords against Apophis.
CARTER
Or so the System Lords presume.
SELMAK
Exactly. An alliance between Apophis and Heru'ur could overwhelm all
the other system lords combined.
O'NEILL
And that would be...bad?
SELMAK
One enemy is easier to target than many. Our spies believe that
Apophis has agreed to the meeting because he is willing to use such
an alliance to topple the system lords. After which he will deal
with Heru'ur. If he succeeds...
O'NEILL
Galactic badness! Huge!
DANIEL
So what do we do?
CARTER
Find a way to sabotage the alliance.
[Jacob brings up some symbols on Daniel's computer screen.]
SELMAK
Doctor Jackson, have you seen symbols like this before?
DANIEL
Well, it looks similar to Phoenician letters, but I can't be sure.
SELMAK
We believe it is a technical manual. None of our Tok'ra linguists
could translate it.
O'NEILL
Um, excuse my denseness, but...what does this have to do
with...anything?
SELMAK
The hatred and mistrust between Apophis and Heru'ur goes back a long
time.
CARTER
So if we can get them to fight each other...
SELMAK
They both control the two largest armies of the Goa'uld. A war
between them would decimate both sides and return the balance of
power back to the system lords. Which, for now, is much more
preferable to one all-powerful Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Wait, I think I've got it! It's uh...three to the blue, four to the
orange, and...and three to the blue. Sounds like some sort of colour
coated combination for a lock.
SELMAK
Excellent! We may have a chance now. If you will accompany me.
O'NEILL
Ah! Wait a minute! Just...stop, hold it. If you're about to say
you're going to explain along the way, I'm going to lose it! I've
just about had it with the way the Tok'ra do business. I wanna know
exactly what we're dealing with here. Every mission detail you've
got right now, or we go nowhere!
JACOB
I was going to tell ya, Jack.
O'NEILL
Okay. Never mind.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond joins Daniel, O'Neill, Carter and Jacob at the table.]
DANIEL
The meeting will be taking place at a region of space known as the
Tobin System. The Tobin Civilization, originating from Earth
thousands of years ago, has been extinct for a number of centuries,
but one of their legacies is the equivalent of a large mine field in
space.
O'NEILL
As close as you can get to neutral territory, Sir.
CARTER
The mines, originally designed to protect the planet, will actually
hone in on a wide variety of energy signals, including that of
Goa'uld weaponry.
GH
So, if either Heru'ur or Apophis decided to open fire, they would be
destroyed by the mines?
JACOB
We'll take the cargo ship I came in. If we leave immediately, we can
reach the minefield before the meeting, and reprogram one of the
mines to hit Apophis's ship.
HAMMOND
So, he'll think Heru'ur's behind it?
CARTER
Exactly.
JACOB
The problem is the mines are in constant motion. Repositioning
themselves randomly.
HAMMOND
So, how can you reprogram one?
O'NEILL
That's a little bit of a concern for me, Sir.
JACOB
The mines have sophisticated inertial engines that are unaffected by
gravitational conditions.
CARTER
Basically, we should be able to safely use the cargo ship's rings to
pull a mine inside.
JACOB
At which point, I'll pilot the ship to match its movements.
DANIEL
The Tok'ra have what they believe is the Tobin manual to how the
mines work.
JACOB
Yeah, unfortunately, certain aspects of the translation have
previously eluded us. Now, with Dr. Jackson's help, we can use the
manual to reprogram the mine to hone in on a specific energy
signature. One of our operatives aboard Apophis's ship will have
planted a beacon that will broadcast that energy signature.
CARTER
The mine will think that Apophis's ship is firing a weapon, move
towards it and explode.
HAMMOND
Sounds very risky.
O'NEILL
Insane might be another word.
JACOB
Obviously, I'll need Dr. Jackson, and there might be some
complicated mathematical calculations to be done, Sam would be a big
help, too.
[O'Neill clears his throat.]
JACOB
Of course, Colonel O'Neill is...always lots of fun to have around.
The timing is critical, George.
HAMMOND
Then you have a go.
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP, PRISON HALL
[Teal'c is dragged in by Rak'nor and another Jaffa. They shackle his
wrists to chains hanging from the ceiling. Rak'nor storms in and throws
water on Teal'c's face.]
RAK'NOR
Do not think your punishment is over, Shol'va!
[A Goa'uld, Terok, enters.]
TEROK
Back away! Welcome Teal'c! I am Terok.
[Terok stabs Teal'c in the pouch with a Goa'uld pain stick. A bright
light shines from Teal'c's mouth as he screams in pain.]
TEROK
Who do you suppose is more well known among Jaffa?
[Terok punches Teal'c in the stomach.]
TEROK
You...or I? Terok or the shol'va?
RAK'NOR
Many know of Teal'c, but all Jaffa fear you, My Lord.
TEROK
After all, I have been around much, much longer. And from the looks
of things I will be around long after you've gone.
[Teal'c spits in Terok's face. Terok wipes the spit from his face and
tastes it, spitting it out.]
TEROK
From this moment on, every tear you shed will be recorded...
[Terok activates a recording device.]
TEROK
...so that all Jaffa alive, now and forever more, will see how weak
and powerless the great and powerful Teal'c really was before he
died. They'll see how he came to understand how wrong he was about
the Goa'uld. They will see you pray to the Gods for forgiveness and
beg to be granted an honourable death.
TEAL'C
Never!
TEROK
Let us not argue about the future.
[Terok again stabs Teal'c with the pain stick. Teal'c screams as the
light erupts from inside him.]
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Carter and Jacob are walking toward the elevator.]
O'NEILL
Where is he?
CARTER
He's on 18.
O'NEILL
Jacob, do you really think the Goa'uld are stupid enough to fire on
each other in a mine field?
[They step into an elevator.]
JACOB
No, and we don't want them to. The ultimate goal is to get them into
an all-out war, where both their fleets will be seriously weakened.
CARTER
You think that's going to happen?
JACOB
If he thinks Heru'ur's ambushing him, Apophis will most likely
retreat. However, his next move will be to order his armies to
attack Heru'ur's planet.
[The elevator stops and the doors open to reveal Daniel standing out in
the corridor struggling with a pile of books and his bags.</blockquote>
O'NEILL
What are you doing?
DANIEL
I could use a hand here.
[O'Neill picks up one of the bags.]
O'NEILL
Sure you got everything?
DANIEL
Wanna try to reprogram that mine without the proper translation?
O'NEILL
Thought of a laptop?
DANIEL
Well, I had one, I just couldn't get Beck's Ancient Phoenician
Symbology on CD at archaeology.com, so...
[Quite deliberately, O'Neill pushes Daniel's glasses back up his nose
with two fingers.]
EXT--AIRBASE RUNWAY
[Carter, Jacob, O'Neill and Daniel are walking up the runway. In front
of them, a Goa'uld scout ship decloaks.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP, CARGO HOLD
O'NEILL
Still going with the gold, huh? Is there something different here?
JACOB
I had the bulk head removed. Once we've moved the mine inside, we're
going to need all the room we can get.
DANIEL
What about the escape pods?
JACOB
If that mine touches anything in here, escape pods aren't going to
do us any good.
DANIEL
Oh.
EXT--SCOUT SHIP IN HYPERSPARCE
INT--SCOUT SHIP, CARGO HOLD
[Daniel and Carter are sitting on the floor reading. They are
surrounded by books. O'Neill is playing with the Velcro on his watch.]
O'NEILL
Do you understand any of that?
CARTER
It's all Phoenician to me, Sir.
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP, PRISON HALL
[Teal'c is still shackled to the chains by his wrists. He is slumped
forwards, several wounds visible. Rak'nor is offering him water.]
RAK'NOR
Drink! It is only water. Do you not drink because you wish to die
sooner? It is not recording now. You will not appear weak by
quenching your thirst. Surely, you must realize that Terok will not
let you die before he has gotten what he wants from you. I swear on
my father's name that this is only water.
[Teal'c refuses to drink. Rak'nor walks away.]
TEAL'C
What is the name of your father?
RAK'NOR
Swearing on his name means nothing if you do not know who he was. My
father was called Delnor.
[Rak'nor throws the cup to one side.]
TEAL'C
I know that name.
RAK'NOR
Yes, when you were first prime, you spared his life after Apophis
ordered him killed.
TEAL'C
I remember.
RAK'NOR
When you turned against Apophis, my father believed it was a sign.
He spoke out against the Gods, and supported you. He seared the mark
of the serpent from my forehead. He...he said I was free!
TEAL'C
You are.
RAK'NOR
Other Jaffa worriers also began to believe. Like my father, they
followed Bra'tac, who said what you had done would begin a Jaffa
rebellion. He said that one day, all Jaffa would be free from
enslavement at the hands of the Goa'uld.
TEAL'C
He spoke of the truth.
RAK'NOR
No! It was blasphemy! The Goa'uld are Gods! Look at yourself now!
Why will you not admit it?
TEAL'C
Why do you not believe as your father believes?
RAK'NOR
My father believes nothing anymore! He is dead! My father was a
stupid fool, and Apophis killed my whole family because of it. He
who died himself, and was reborn, returning to slay Sokar...He with
the power to slaughter millions in a instant. He commands the
greatest army the Goa'uld have ever known, how could he be anything
but a God? I was fortunate enough to realize that in time to save
myself.
[Terok enters]
TEROK
Listen to Rak'nor, Teal'c! No one can save you but yourself! Not
even Bra'tac lasted this long. With pitiful tears streaming down his
face he admitted we were all powerful Gods!
TEAL'C
He would die first!
TEROK
He did die, Teal'c. But not first. First he prayed to me...prayed to
the Goa'uld for forgiveness. As you will!
[Terok motions for Rak'nor to remove Teal'c's t-shirt. We see burn
marks all over Teal'c's body. Terok again stabs the pain stick into
Teal'c'S pouch. Teal'c screams before passing out.]
EXT--SCOUT SHIP
[The scout ship drops out of hyperspace and approaches a planet in the
distance. The minefield is visible all around it.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
We've reached the Tobin System.
CARTER
Wow. That's a lot of mines!
JACOB
Hundreds of thousands. Prepare to activate the rings.
[Jacob puts a control device on his head.]
O'NEILL
Jacob, what's with the...ear thing?
JACOB
It's a heads-up display that'll help me fly the ship while keeping
the mine centred in the hold.
O'NEILL
And...how hard is that going to be?
JACOB
Well, considering what I have to avoid out there, hard.
EXT--SCOUT SHIP MANOUVERING THROUGH MINEFIELD
INT--SCOUT SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[We see the control computer targeting a mine.]
JACOB
Clear the rings!
[O'Neill and Daniel clear the books from the ring transporter platform.
We see the computer has a lock on one of the mines.]
O'NEILL
Now, Sam.
[Carter activates the ring transporter and a mine is transported into
the cargo hold. It hovers low in the hold, above the floor.]
JACOB
All right! Get on it!
[Carter gathers up the equipment. O'Neill is peering under the mine
while Daniel walks around it.]
DANIEL
Uh-oh.
O'NEILL
What?
JACOB
What, don't you recognize the symbols?
DANIEL
What symbols?
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP
[Teal'c is still manacled and slumped.]
TOR'AK
Save yourself, Teal'c! It is not too late.
[Tor'ak starts to torture Teal'c with a Goa'uld ribbon device.]
TOR'AK
One second longer and you would be dead! Why admit the Goa'ulds are
Gods? Why do I waste my time? Because it is the truth! I do this for
one reason. Not to break you! Not to torture you! I do this to save
you. Maybe you do not fear me, or even death itself, but you should
fear what waist beyond if you die this way. Sha'mel kallah! Say what
needs to be said to deliver your soul and the souls of all those
that have embraced your sin.
TEAL'C
Kree shak shel nok!
[Tor'ak attacks Teal'c once again with the ribbon device. Then he slams
the pain stick at the recording device and storms out.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP, CARGO HOLD
[Carter and Daniel are looking around the mine.]
JACOB
There should be a panel that opens and allows access to the inside.
Try underneath.
CARTER
I think there's some thing here, Dad. Can you raise the bomb any
higher?
[Carter lies down on the floor and slides underneath the hovering
mine.]
CARTER
It looks like a circle with a cross on it.
DANIEL
That could be it.
CARTER
Okay, what do I do?
JACOB
I'm pretty sure you touch it.
O'NEILL
Pretty sure?
JACOB
The last time a Tok'ra was sent to attempt this, they were never
heard from again.
O'NEILL
Well that's news!
DANIEL
No, I think that's it.
CARTER
You think?
DANIEL
Okay, I...I'm sure that's it.
[Carter almost touches the panel.]
DANIEL
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait!
O'NEILL
Hey!
DANIEL
No, no! Sorry! That's it, I'm sure.
[Carter touches the panel and it opens, almost touching her body.
Inside is a circle of flashing coloured lights around a central
handle.]
JACOB
Don't touch it anywhere but inside the opening!
[Daniel lies down under the mine with the top of his head against the
top of Carter's.]
CARTER
Daniel? What do these mean?
DANIEL
Um, those indicate the various frequencies the mine is sensitive to.
CARTER
So we need to erase them all and input only the one we want, right?
DANIEL
Right.
[O'Neill joins them under the mine.]
O'NEILL
How long is this going to take, kids?
DANIEL
I have no idea.
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP
[Rak'nor picks up the recording device. Teal'c is hanging by his wrists
from the chains.]
RAK'NOR
Terok grows frustrated by you.
TEAL'C
He thought he was recording my humiliation. Instead he was only
recording his own.
RAK'NOR
Do you not believe that your soul will be forever punished?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld are parasites. They use Jaffa as incubators until they
are ready to take human hosts. I have seen the world from which they
originated. I have stood beside the swamps from which they first
rose. They are merely flesh and blood just like you or I!
RAK'NOR
Lies!
TEAL'C
Why would I lie? If there was a chance that they were Gods, if I
thought that my soul would be forever punished, why would I lie?
They have manipulated our bodies. So, too are they manipulating our
minds with false beliefs!
RAK'NOR
You believe this so strongly that you risk dying in sin?
TEAL'C
I believe it so strongly that I fight to live with every last bit of
strength that I have, so that one day enough Jaffa will believe as I
do...enough to end the Goa'uld and free us all forever!
INT--SCOUT SHIP, CARGO HOLD
[Daniel and Carter are lying under the mine.]
DANIEL
Okay. Three to the...blue.
CARTER
Which way is blue?
DANIEL
That's a good question.
[Carter turns the handle clockwise. A blue light flashes.]
CARTER
Okay. Clockwise is blue.
DANIEL
Three notches.
[Carter turns the handle twice more.]
DANIEL
Okay. Four to the orange.
[Carter turns the handle four times anticlockwise.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[Jacob sees a mine approaching the ship outside.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP, CARGO HOLD
DANIEL
Three to the blue.
[The mine starts to slowly descend closer to Carter and Daniel.]
CARTER
Uh...Dad?
[Daniel moves out from under the mine.]
O'NEILL
Jacob?
[O'Neill grabs Carter's feet and pulls her out from under the mine.
O'Neill and Carter move to safety behind the bulkhead.]
O'NEILL
Jacob!
JACOB
I know! I have a problem here.
[The mine starts to shift toward the bulkhead where Carter and O'Neill
are standing.]
O'NEILL
Jacob!
INT&mdashSCOUT SHIP, FLIGHT DECK.
[We see the mines outside in space start to move away from the ship.
The mine in the cargo hold returns to its original position. O'Neill
walks to stand behind Jacob.]
O'NEILL
So, Jacob, nice flying.
JACOB
Thanks! How much longer?
CARTER
Not sure, why?
JACOB
Someone's coming. I'm cloaking the ship.
EXT--SPACE.
[A Goa'uld mother ship appears out of hyperspeed.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
It's Apophis.
CARTER
Three to blue.
[Carter turns the handle three notches clockwise. We hear the sound of
a buzzer. The lights start to all flash green.]
DANIEL
Uh, it's flashing green. Green is good?
DANIEL
No.
CARTER
Bad?
DANIEL
Bad.
CARTER
How bad?
DANIEL
Very, very, bad!
CARTER
Dad? We may need Selmak's help here!
JACOB
All right. Jack? You're going to have to take the stick!
O'NEILL
What? Really?
JACOB
Take the helm. Keep the mine centre circle, and avoid hitting
anything out there.
[Jacob and O'Neill swap places so that O'Neill takes the pilot's seat.]
O'NEILL
Okay! Okay! I've got it! I got it.
[The mine starts to rise.]
O'NEILL
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
JACOB
Huh?
O'NEILL
I'm cool. I'm all right. It's not so easy.
[Jacob goes back to Carter and Daniel. The mine returns to hovering
just above them.]
JACOB
What's going on?
CARTER
The crystals are flashing green.
DANIEL
I think it's going to explode.
JACOB
Deactivate it.
DANIEL
I don't know how. If you enter the wrong combination, a failsafe is
enacted, and you have 5 minutes to...enter the right
combination...or the...mine explodes.
JACOB
Apophis is already here. If we release the mine now, and it
explodes, the mission will be ruined.
DANIEL
And if we don't release the mine now, we'll be ruined.
JACOB
Then, enter the right combination!
CARTER
We tried. What does Selmac say?
JACOB
Try again.
DANIEL
Very helpful.
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP, PRISON HALL
[The Gate rises. Terok enters with a Jaffa. He points at Teal'c.]
TOR'AK
Bring him.
[Two Jaffa release Teal'c'S bonds and drag him from the prison hall.]
EXT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP, THRONE ROOM
[Apophis is seated on the throne surrounding by females and Jaffa.]
JAFFA
My Lord, Heru'ur hails you.
[We see Heru'ur appear on a communication screen at the front of the
throne room/flight deck.]
HERU'UR
Kree shak shel, Apophis!
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Heru'ur's ship is here.
[We hear in the background Heru'ur talking to Apophis. Jacob is
monitoring the transmissions.]
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
HERU'UR
Onak kla keela vurok!
APOPHIS
Mak shel lo komo ashma!
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Heru'ur is saying Apophis's forces are great, but not great enough
to match the collective army of the system lords. With his
assistance, the battle will be swift and end in their favour.
O'NEILL
Apophis?
JACOB
He wants to know what Heru'ur wants in exchange. Heru'ur wants to
maintain dominion over all that is currently his, plus that which is
currently owned by Cronus.
O'NEILL
He has to know Apophis will screw him eventually.
JACOB
Heru'ur is offering Apophis a gift. A token to show his honor and
loyalty. After Apophis accepts, they will swear an oath to solidify
their bond.
O'NEILL
What's he offering?
INT--HERU'UR'S SHIP, THRONE ROOM
[Terok enters with Teal'c who is thrown into the room.]
HERU'UR
Ona rak shol'va!
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
[Apophis sits forward at the sight of Teal'c.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Teal'c.
DANIEL
Teal'c's on Chulak.
O'NEILL
Apparently not.
JACOB
Apophis is going to think the deal over. As soon as he makes up his
mind, the transfer will take place.
CARTER
Uh, dammit! This is not working!
DANIEL
It doesn't make sense! It clearly says three to blue, four to
orange, and three to blue!
JACOB
How much time do we have?
CARTER
Less than a minute.
DANIEL
Okay! These are Tobin numbers. This is 1, this is 2, this is 3...
CARTER
Wait, wait! What about zero?
DANIEL
What?
CARTER
Zero. Why didn't you say zero?
DANIEL
Uh...be...because there's no zero in the Phoenician numerical
system.
JACOB
What if the Tobins added it?
CARTER
He's right! Inventing technology with this level of sophistication
would require a zero.
DANIEL
Why?
CARTER
Just trust me, it's a math thing.
DANIEL
So, I've been off by one this whole time?
CARTER
30 seconds.
DANIEL
Well, okay then, uh, uh, two to blue, three to orange and...and two
to blue.
[Carter turns the handle as Daniel speaks.]
DANIEL
That's it!
JACOB
They got it!
CARTER
Now, we enter the right frequency.
INT--GOA'ULD SHIP, PRISON HALL
[Teal'c is being dragged back in. Rak'nor starts to shackle him. Terok
stops him, leaving only one wrist chained.]
TEROK
There is little time left for you. If you repent now, I would save
your soul and end your suffering.
TEAL'C
So that Apophis can revive me, and begin again?
[Teal'c laughs. Terok leaves. Teal'c falls to his knees.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
[O'Neill is still piloting the ship and maintaining the mine's
position.]
O'NEILL
You know what'll happen to Teal'c if Apophis gets a hold of him.
JACOB
Anything we do in attempting a rescue would give us away.
O'NEILL
Yeah? So?
JACOB
So, you know as well as I do that bigger things are at stake here.
He's your friend, I know. But we've both had to deal with losses
like this in battle situations. Tok'ra operatives have already given
their lives, and others are at great risk on those ships right now.
All for the sake of this mission. I'm sorry, Colonel, but Teal'c is
expendable.
DANIEL
One, two, three. Done!
[The mine closes up.]
CARTER
We're done!
JACOB
All right! I have to deploy.
O'NEILL
If they start shooting at each other...
JACOB
They'd better not yet. We're still in the middle of this minefield.
Deploy.
[The transporter rings activate and transport the mine out into space.]
CARTER
Nothing's happening.
JACOB
Our operative could have been compromised.
DANIEL
Or, we reprogrammed the mine wrong. No! I'm...sure we reprogrammed
the mine right.
INT--HEUR'UR'S SHIP
[Apophis appears on the screen.]
APOPHIS
Komah ata, Heru'ur.
HERU'UR
Onak la hassa, slel Apophis. Send the shol'va to Lord Apophis.
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
Apophis has agreed to the alliance.
CARTER
Dad, Teal'c risked his life to save all of us when we came to rescue
you on Netu. You owe him. We all do.
DANIEL
Wait a minute, how is Heru'ur going to transport Teal'c to Apophis's
ship?
JACOB
He would probably use rings.
CARTER
Well, then we can save Teal'c the same way that he saved us. By
intercepting the matter stream
JACOB
It won't work while the ship is in stealth.
O'NEILL
So uncloak it.
JACOB
It would take some pretty fancy flying.
[O'Neill hands Jacob the HUD.]
O'NEILL
It's your ship.
INT--GOA'ULD MOTHER SHIP, PRISON HALL
[We see Teal'c taking a drink of water held by Rak'nor.]
RAK'NOR
I've never seen anyone endure such torture! Yet, none of it comes
close to what Apophis will do to you. He will kill you a thousand
times!
TEAL'C
Of that I am certain.
RAK'NOR
And you will never admit that he's a god?
TEAL'C
Never!
RAK'NOR
You are either insane, or...
[The prison Gate opens. Terok and a Jaffa enter.]
TEROK
Take him down! The shol'va is to be transported to Apophis!
[The Jaffa unchains Teal'c who starts to struggle. Terok fires the
ribbon device at Teal'c and Teal'c and the Jaffa fall.]
TEROK
What do you think you are doing, shol'va?
[Terok starts to attack Teal'c with the ribbon device.]
RAK'NOR
My Lord, you are killing him!
TEROK
I will not be denied the satisfaction of watching him die at least
once!
RAK'NOR
My Lord...
[Rak'nor stabs Terok in the back of the neck with the pain stick. Terok
falls to the floor.]
EXT--SPACE
[The matter stream for the transporter rings activates. Jacob flies the
scout ship into the stream.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP.
O'NEILL
What happened?
JACOB
We missed him!
CARTER
So, what now?
JACOB
We'd better get out of here!
INT--HERU'UR'S SHIP
JAFFA
My Lord, a cargo ship attempted to intercept the matter stream.
HERU'UR
What?
[We see the Tok'ra operative dressed like a serpent guard press a
button on his wrist.]
EXT--SPACE
[We see a mine heading for the mother ship.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
It looks like you programmed the mine right! It's going for
Apophis's ship.
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
[Jaffa drag a prisoner in front of Apophis. We see it's Terok.]
APOPHIS
What is this?
JAFFA
Heru'ur transported him instead of the shol'va.
EXT--SPACE
[We see a mine heading for Apophis's ship and exploding against the
hull.]
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
JAFFA
Heru'ur attacks!
[Heru'ur appears on the screen.]
APOPHIS
You dare to attack me?
HERU'UR
It is deception.
APOPHIS
The deception is yours! Why did you not send me the shol'va?
INT--SCOUT SHIP
O'NEILL
We got to go back for Teal'c.
JACOB
And do what?
O'NEILL
Something!
JACOB
It's too late.
EXT--SPACE
[Ten ships decloak around Apophis's ship.]
INT--HERU'UR'S SHIP
[Heru'ur looks concerned.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
JACOB
That's not possible!
O'NEILL
Apparently, it is.
JACOB
The Goa'uld have never been able to cloak an entire mother ship
before, let alone a fleet!
INT--APOPHIS'S SHIP
APOPHIS
Kree Heru'ur! Shel pac herac Apophis!
INT--HERU'UR'S SHIP
[Heru'ur looking alarmed.]
EXT--SPACE
[We see a glider escaping from Heru'ur's ship as Apophis's ship starts
firing at Heru'ur's ship, blowing it up.]
INT--SCOUT SHIP
CARTER
They're protecting Apophis's ship!
JACOB
They're allowing him to escape. The sensors are picking up a glider
that seems to have escaped from Heru'ur's ship before it exploded.
DANIEL
Uh...Heru'ur himself?
JACOB
We can't let him get away. Onak Sha Kree! Shal Goa'uld!
JAFFA
(over radio)
Goah Sha Kree! Loe Goa'uld!
JACOB
I asked him which god he worshiped, and he answered with a Tok'ra
password. This is Jacob Carter! Identify yourself!
RAK'NOR
My name is Rak'nor.
JACOB
Who are you? How did you know how to answer my hail?
RAK'NOR
I am the Jaffa who helped Teal'c escape.
O'NEILL
How do we know that?
INT--GLIDER
[We see Rak'nor in the pilot seat and Teal'c seated behind him.]
TEAL'C
It is good to hear your voice, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Glad ya made it, Teal'c.
TEAL'C
As am I.
JACOB
We can rendezvous on the third moon of Tichenor.
RAK'NOR
We will meet you there.
DANIEL
Well, I guess we've stopped the alliance.
SELMAK
Unfortunately, it is the worst possible result.
O'NEILL
No war.
SELMAK
No. We could not have predicted that Apophis would bring a clocked
fleet into the minefield.
CARTER
So what now?
SELMAK
Apophis will easily absorb Heru'ur's forces into his own. He is now
a bigger threat than ever before.
