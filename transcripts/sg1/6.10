TEASER
EXT--PANGAR STARGATE
[A team of scientists and workers are milling around trying not to be
too obvious in watching a group of delegates that is gathered at the
DHD awaiting the arrival of travelers through the Stargate.]
DOLLEN
Calm yourself, Commander.
TEGAR
(walks to stand beside Dollen)
We are about to meet an alien race in person for the first time. If
you are correct, they are more advanced than us and capable of being
a significant threat. That gives me good reason to be on the highest
alert.
DOLLEN
Since the discovery of the temple ruins, we have had reason to
believe that there are other inhabited planets in the galaxy and
now, finally, we have our proof. I for one am relieved. The very
first contact we have made is with a race of humans that seem to be
very much like us.
TEGAR
Maybe you trust them without suspicion, but I cannot.
DOLLEN
Nevertheless, Commander, we must proceed.
[The Stargate kawooshes to life.]
DOLLEN
They are sending their most respected team of representatives. No
doubt the leader of this group will be a brilliant and savvy
negotiator.
TEGAR
We must be at our best to match the challenge.
DOLLEN
Personally, I cannot wait to meet a man of such genius.
[SG-1 emerges from the Stargate, and O'Neill starts down the steps.]
O'NEILL
(grinning)
Howdy, folks!
EXT--PANGAR, MOUNTAINS OVERLOOKING A CITY, DAY
[A zeppelin flies slowly overhead.]
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING, DAY
[Dollen, SG-1, and Tegar enter a room that resembles Japanese
architecture--paper walls, lots of dark wood, and steps leading into
the sunken center of the room. There is a large rectangular table
surrounded by chairs in the lower level. A woman places a tray with a
pitcher of water and glasses in the middle of the table and leaves.]
O'NEILL
Nice!
DOLLEN
Thank you, Colonel. We would be happy to take you on a full tour of
our city, but first we would like to spend a little time talking
about our mutual interests. So please, please sit.
[The group moves toward the table. As Dollen continues, they take their
seats, O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c, and Jonas on one side, Dollen and Tegar
on the other.]
DOLLEN
To be honest, we are still trying to adjust to the fact that our,
uh... Stargate, as you call it... is no longer a mere relic of a
bygone era.
TEGAR
Obviously, it was quite a shock when your communication machine
appeared last month.
CARTER
(nodding)
First contact can be somewhat unnerving.
DOLLEN
Well, we are all very pleased to finally get the chance to talk
face-to-face.
TEGAR
From our study of the ancient temple, we have been able to deduce
the Stargate was an interplanetary transportation device.
DOLLEN
But we haven't determined how to make a connection with the many
worlds described in the writings in the temple.
CARTER
(smiles and nods)
It took us a while to get the hang of it, too.
DOLLEN
We know that the symbols on the Stargate itself are the key, but as
for the number and sequence to enter in the dialing device...
JONAS
We can definitely help you out there.
CARTER
(hesitant)
Once we get to know you a little better.
DOLLEN
(taken aback)
Oh, yes. Of course. We intend to allow you full access to our... our
citizens, our history, our culture, so that you may come to trust
us.
O'NEILL
I hope we can reciprocate.
[Dollen gestures to an aide at the back of the room. As he speaks, the
young man steps between O'Neill and Carter, and sets a small bottle of
dark liquid on the table between them.]
DOLLEN
We also want to make it clear that we intend to offer all that we
can in trade for any knowledge or technology that you are willing to
share.
[O'Neill picks up the bottle and considers it a moment.]
O'NEILL
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
DOLLEN
We call it Tretonin, Colonel. It is our greatest scientific
discovery.
CARTER
How so?
DOLLEN
(standing up)
Major Carter, from what you have told me about your world, your
people suffer from a myriad of illnesses, many are untreatable.
Tretonin makes our immune systems impervious to any ailment. We live
in perfect health.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, DAY
[Teal'c and Jonas observe a Pangaran man digging. They turn and walk
toward the dirt roadway.]
TEAL'C
What is it you wish to achieve here, Jonas Quinn?
JONAS
I figure if we're gonna learn about these people, the best place to
start's at the beginning.
ZENNA
(offscreen)
Earthens!
[Jonas and Teal'c step past a stone column onto the road, where they
see Zenna Valk, a young, beautiful Pangaran archaeologist.]
JONAS
Uh... Earthlings.
(softly, to Teal'c)
Sort of.
ZENNA
I am Zenna Valk, supervisor of the temple research project. It is a
pleasure to meet the explorers from the planet Earth.
JONAS
Well, we're not... originally... from there.
TEAL'C
However, we have dedicated ourselves to the cause of the Tau'ri.
[Zenna looks confused.]
TEAL'C
(clarifying)
Earth.
ZENNA
Am I at least correct in assuming you are Jaffa?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
ZENNA
I cannot tell you how exciting this is. We have learned much from
the discovery of this site, but it must pale in comparison to what
you can teach us.
JONAS
(shrugs)
I don't know about that, but we'd love it if you showed us around.
ZENNA
By all means. That was my intention.
[She starts walking, taking them on a tour of the dig site.]
ZENNA
We first discovered these ruins over a hundred years ago, and since
then we've dedicated ourselves to studying the secrets the Goa'uld
left behind. This area was obviously some sort of reception
colonnade for greeting travelers who came through the Stargate. The
real discovery was made just over here.
[She leads them off the road.]
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING, DAY
DOLLEN
Although we fully admit Tretonin is not without side-effects, we
assure you the good it can do far outweighs any negative aspects.
[Dollen walks down to the table and retakes his seat next to Tegar.]
CARTER
What kind of side-effects are we talking about, exactly?
TEGAR
Depends on the individual. Most people experience almost no reaction
to it. Those who do merely require more regulated doses.
CARTER
We'll need a decent amount for testing.
O'NEILL
On Earth, of course.
DOLLEN
Oh, yes. Certainly.
TEGAR
Of course, we will need something in return from you. As a measure
of good faith.
CARTER
We've been authorized to give you these ten addresses...
[She hands a file folder across the table to Dollen.]
CARTER
...And a rudimentary lesson in 'gate technology. These are all
peaceful worlds, safe from hostile forces, rich with historical
relics and natural resources.
DOLLEN
Well, this is a very generous offer, Major. Very generous. However,
based on our own studies of the writings in the temple, we have
compiled a list of the names of the worlds that we would like to
visit.
[He hands a folder to O'Neill, who opens it and shows it to Carter. The
writing on the paper inside resembles Punjabi or Mongolian... something
central Asian.]
O'NEILL
(quietly, to Carter)
Do you recognize any of these?
CARTER
Well, I'll have to cross-reference the Goa'uld names with our
database of Stargate addresses, but offhand I recognize these three,
sir.
[She indicates the addresses at the bottom of the page.]
CARTER
Classified off-limits. Goa'uld homeworlds.
O'NEILL
(to Dollen and Tegar)
Yeah, fellas, you really don't wanna go here. Not exactly a walk in
the park, you know what I mean?
TEGAR
We know that the Goa'uld are a hostile race that once rule this
planet centuries ago.
O'NEILL
Alright, you're new to this so we'll cut you a break...
TEGAR
(adamant)
Those are the worlds we wish to explore!
DOLLEN
(calmly)
We believe they are significant to our history.
O'NEILL
Look, guys, we're not lying to you about this. You don't wanna go
there first time out. Trust me.
TEGAR
If you have been to these worlds and survived, can we not?
O'NEILL
All I'm trying to say to you is, it would be stupid.
TEGAR
We are aware of the risks and believe the rewards are worth the
potential consequences, as you and your people obviously do,
Colonel.
DOLLEN
Please, Colonel. In exchange for the Tretonin we are simply asking
that you respect our wishes.
[O'Neill glances between the Pangarans consideringly.]
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, DAY
[Teal'c, Jonas and Zenna are walking across a low rise. They have just
visited the remains of a small building where two scientists continue
to uncover part of a wall. Zenna leads them down the slope to where a
stone block entrance is set into the side of the hill. They pass a man
leaving as they prepare to enter.]
ZENNA
There is an underground tunnel system that leads to the main temple.
TEAL'C
It is most likely a means of escape to the Stargate in case of
attack.
ZENNA
That's exactly what I thought. Please.
[She motions for them to follow as she enters the doorway.]
INT--PANGAR UNDERGROUND CHAMBER, DAY
[The room is dimly lit by lanterns and the sunlight from the tunnel
entrance. A man uses a small brush to clean an artifact as Zenna,
Teal'c and Jonas come down the stone stairway. He looks up as they
enter, then goes back to his work.]
ZENNA
The writing in this chamber seems to tell the story of the Goa'uld
who once ruled here.
[Zenna walks to a life-sized fresco on the wall. Teal'c and Jonas
follow, not only listening to her explanation, but studying the artwork
for themselves.]
ZENNA
We've been attempting to decipher this section of the wall for many
months, thus far with limited success.
TEAL'C
It is written in a rare dialect of ancient Goa'uld. An account of
the warlord Shak'ran.
JONAS
He was a System Lord, who was eventually defeated by Apophis about
three hundred years ago.
TEAL'C
Indeed. Until his defeat it appears Pangar served as Shak'ran's
homeworld.
ZENNA
And what of the Goa'uld Apophis, the one who conquered Shak'ran?
TEAL'C
(proudly)
He was killed in battle not long ago.
ZENNA
As I suspected, you have much wisdom to share.
[She notices two guards passing through the cavern on their way between
tunnels.]
JONAS
Teal'c and I'll be more than happy to help you out with the
translation. I've got at least a dozen ancient ciphers I could try.
ZENNA
Please, I do not wish to be overheard by the Pangar security
contingent.
[Teal'c and Jonas look at her in confusion.]
ZENNA
(quietly)
There is something you need to know about the Tretonin.
(resuming tour-guide voice)
Please come with me and I will finish showing you the rest of the
ruins.
(whispering)
I will try to talk to you later.
[Jonas and Teal'c exchange a suspicious look as they follow her back up
the stairs.]
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, DAY
[A woman is using a small brush to unearth a vase half-buried in the
ground while a colleague looks on. SG-1 emerges from between two metal
platforms the workers have set up in order to study the ruins. The team
observes the continuing efforts as they walk and talk.]
TEAL'C
(to O'Neill and Carter)
She said there was something we needed to know about the Tretonin.
JONAS
(indicating passing sentries)
She seemed really worried about these guys. She was going way out on
a limb just talking to us about something other than Goa'uld
hieroglyphs.
O'NEILL
Alright. You guys keep digging, see what you can find.
(holds up the bottle of Tretonin)
Carter and I'll get this sample back to the SGC.
[Jonas and Teal'c head back to meet with Zenna as O'Neill and Carter
continue on toward the Stargate. A pair of security guards watches the
officers carefully as they pass.]
INT--PANGAR UNDERGROUND CHAMBER, DAY
[Zenna stands near the fresco with a notebook and pen. She appears deep
in concentration, but glances up and smiles to greet Jonas.]
ZENNA
Jonas.
JONAS
Doctor Valk.
ZENNA
Please, call me Zenna.
JONAS
(gestures at the wall)
How's it coming?
ZENNA
(sighs)
It's slow and painstaking. Any help you're willing to give me...
JONAS
(holds up a composition book)
Certainly. I brought those...
(distracted)
...ciphers I was telling you about.
(glances around)
Looks like we're alone.
[Zenna looks up at him, startled, then back at the wall. She walks over
and points a some symbols on the fresco.]
ZENNA
What do you suppose this means?
JONAS
(carefully)
You said there was something we needed to know about the Tretonin.
[Zenna blinks at him and shakes her head, feigning confusion.]
ZENNA
I'm sorry, you must have misunderstood.
JONAS
No, I think you were pretty clear.
[Her eyes glance furtively behind him.]
JONAS
No one's coming. Teal'c is up there standing guard. You can talk to
me.
ZENNA
(nervously)
I don't have anything to say.
[She tries to leave, but Jonas puts a hand on her arm to stop her.]
JONAS
Hey, Zenna. If you know something--
ZENNA
(insistent)
No. I don't.
[She shakes off his hand and flees up the stairway.]
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, DAY
[Teal'c sits at the tunnel entrance. Zenna emerges at a trot and heads
away down to the roadway. Teal'c rises as if to go after her, but stops
as Jonas joins him.]
JONAS
(sighs)
That was strange.
TEAL'C
What did Zenna Valk have to say?
JONAS
(frustrated)
Nothing. Someone must have gotten to her.
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, LATER THAT DAY
[Teal'c and Jonas are observing the Pangarans' work. Suddenly, Jonas
turns, hops over a low stone wall and walks purposefully into the work
camp.]
INT--PANGAR EXCAVATION CAMP, TENT, DAY
[Jonas enters cautiously and looks around. There is a large map hung on
a blackboard on one side of the tent, a bed, and several tables strewn
with books and scrolls. Jonas goes to a stack of books and pulls out
the second from the top. Leafing through, he sees sketches of the
murals in the underground cavern. He finds a folded piece of paper
between two pages, which he opens and reads, looking concerned.]
PANGARAN WORKER
(outside)
Right away.
[Jonas looks up nervously, folds the paper, and shuts it back inside
the book. He puts the book back in its stack and moves on to a larger
one nearby. Inside the second book, he finds a colorful map. Jonas
looks out the window, wary of being discovered.]
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION CAMP, DAY
[Jonas exits the tent and carefully trots out to meet Teal'c, who is
standing guard. They walk through the camp as they discuss Jonas's
findings.]
JONAS
(a little breathless)
I think I've got something. She's on Tretonin herself. Looks like
she has regular appointments to get injections.
TEAL'C
Continue.
[They stop by a set of scaffolding next to a segment of wall.]
JONAS
I was thinkin' we'd go and check out the place where they get their
shots. Found a map of the city. I'm pretty sure I can get us there.
[Teal'c nods.]
JONAS
Lets do it.
[As they walk off, Zenna peers through a gap in the wall, looking
worried.]
EXT--PANGAR CITY STREET, EVENING
[Two sentries walk by. Behind them, Jonas and Teal'c sneak around the
corner of a building and walk inside.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, HALLWAY
[Teal'c and Jonas enter a dark hallway. The only light comes from their
flashlights. They come across a set of bottles and flasks containing
different colored liquids.]
JONAS
(whispering)
Looks like this is where they actually make the drug, as well as
administer it.
TEAL'C
(looking further down the hall)
This way.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, MANUFACTURING WING
[They enter a large, dimly lit room and walk out onto the second-story
catwalk. Water churns softly in the background and sends shimmers of
light onto the walls.]
JONAS
What is it?
TEAL'C
I am not sure.
JONAS
Well, something tells me this isn't the rec room.
TEAL'C
No, it is not.
[They reach a corner in the walkway and look out over the railing. A
huge tank of water roils below them. There is a quiet chorus of
squealing noises.]
JONAS
There's something living in there.
TEAL'C
Goa'uld symbiotes.
JONAS
Are you sure?
TEAL'C
Yes. And there are a great many.
JONAS
What are they doing?
SENTRY #1
(shouting from the lower level)
Who's there? Identify yourselves.
[An alarm begins to sound, and more sentries appear behind Jonas and
Teal'c. They turn to face the most immediate problem.]
SENTRY #1
Stop!
[Teal'c pins Sentry #2 against the wall and backhands him. Sentry #3
tackles Jonas; they crash through the railing and land in the pool of
symbiotes.]
JONAS
Teal'c!
[Teal'c turns from his prisoner and runs to the hole in the railing,
the sentry following seconds later. Seeing Jonas in peril, Teal'c runs
for the stairs to the lower level. Meanwhile, one of the symbiotes
rears out of the water at Jonas. He frantically swims toward the edge
of the tank. Teal'c emerges from the stairwell and hurries to the edge
of the tank.]
JONAS
Teal'c! Teal'c.
[Teal'c grabs Jonas's hand and hauls him out of the water to sit
against the wall. Sentry #3 goes under the water, but surfaces moments
later. Teal'c and Sentry #2 pull him out of the tank to lie on the
concrete floor. Jonas stumbles to Sentry #3 and turns him over. There
is a large, vertical entry wound on the back of the sentry's neck.]
JONAS
He's got one in him.
TEAL'C
Stand aside.
[Teal'c pull out his zat and arms it.]
SENTRY #1
Lower your weapon!
[The Pangaran security forces draw pistols and aim them at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
This man is a Goa'uld.
JONAS
(shaking his head)
Teal'c. Something's not right. This guy's completely out of it.
SENTRY #1
(insistently)
Lower you weapon now.
[Teal'c disarms his zat. The group looks down at the fallen sentry.]
EXT--PANGAR MOUNTAINS OVERLOOKING A CITY, DAY
[A zeppelin flies slowly overhead.]
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING
[Tegar and Dollen enter the room where they met with SG-1 earlier,
followed by several sentries. The team is scattered around anxiously.
They gather between the doorway and the table.]
TEGAR
Would you care to tell us what you were doing in the Tretonin
facility?
O'NEILL
You wanna tell us why you have a pool full of Goa'uld symbiotes?!
DOLLEN
You have betrayed our openness with you.
O'NEILL
(incredulous)
Openness. You're raising Goa'ulds! When were you gonna tell us that?
DOLLEN
The symbiotes are a critical component to making Tretonin.
CARTER
Excuse me?
DOLLEN
It is a complicated process, one which is better explained by our
scientists. Quite frankly, we intended to tell you how the Tretonin
was made. Eventually. We just wanted to first assess how you might
react.
O'NEILL
Not well.
TEGAR
I don't know why you're taking such offense. You've told us
yourselves; the Goa'uld are mortal enemies who've enslaved countless
humans. Where is the harm in using them to enhance our quality of
life?
JONAS
Do you really understand the risks involved?
DOLLEN
We have been using the same method to produce Tretonin for nearly
thirty years. We take every precaution possible to protect our
people.
TEAL'C
How were these symbiotes procured?
O'NEILL
Yeah, for people who haven't mastered 'gate travel, you sure got a
lot of 'em.
[Dollen and Tegar share a we're-so-busted glance.]
TEAL'C
We would require answers before sharing any further information
about the Stargate.
TEGAR
We have already told you everything that is necessary.
DOLLEN
Tegar. The colonel is right. There is no reason to keep more
secrets.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, HALLWAY, DAY
[Dollen, Tegar and SG-1 walk down a long corridor lined with doors and
windows.]
DOLLEN
The drug was developed, and is now manufactured and administered,
here. And since its use has spread to more of the general
population, we've implemented other treatment centers throughout
Pangar, as well.
(gestures to a door ahead)
Now, through here is the reason we were able to create Tretonin in
the first place. The symbiotes were not procured through 'gate
travel.
[SG-1 exchanges curious looks as they follow him through the doorway.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, MANUFACTURING LAB, DAY
[Dollen enters, followed closely by SG-1. The room is bare but for a
few pieces of equipment.]
DOLLEN
Our symbiotes are all bred. Here, in captivity.
[SG-1 is dumbfounded as they see a Goa'uld queen, clearly ready to
spawn, in a barred tank on the far side of the room.]
TEAL'C
A queen.
O'NEILL
No kiddin'.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, TREATMENT ROOM
[The infected sentry from the manufacturing wing lies on an examination
table. A medic walks by with a tray of medication. At the doorway,
Dollen turns to SG-1, who are standing in the main lab.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, LABORATORY
DOLLEN
Is there nothing you can do to help him?
CARTER
What's his condition?
DOLLEN
Well, his lower brain functions seem to be intact, his breathing and
heart rate are normal, but he is completely unresponsive to any
stimulus.
CARTER
(befuddled)
That doesn't make sense.
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
[O'Neill gestures for Teal'c to explain things to Dollen.]
TEAL'C
(in lecture mode)
Prior to the process of incubating Goa'uld symbiotes using Jaffa,
the blending between Goa'uld and host had only a one in two chance
of success. Jaffa were created for the very reason of improving the
ability of the symbiotes to take human hosts.
CARTER
(postulating)
So the fact that this symbiote was raised in a tank could explain
the coma-like state.
TEAL'C
(walking toward her)
To the best of my knowledge, a failed blending results in death...
to both Goa'uld and host. This man is very much alive.
DOLLEN
Our understanding is that this is a typical reaction to contact with
Goa'uld offspring.
TEAL'C
A Goa'uld offspring is born with the intellect and knowledge of the
queen who bore it. Normally, the fully developed personality would
emerge, allowing the symbiote to control the host immediately upon
blending.
[Dollen is still confused.]
O'NEILL
(clarifying)
Glowing eyes, cliche behavior, evilness, that kind of thing.
CARTER
This one's more of a blank slate.
DOLLEN
Is it possible that the production raising process has somehow
hindered the development of the symbiote?
TEAL'C
This I do not know.
CARTER
Colonel, I recommend we contact the Tok'ra.
[Dollen looks up sharply.]
CARTER
They may have a deeper understanding of this man's condition. And at
the very least, they might be able to take the symbiote out of him.
DOLLEN
Uh... I'm sorry. Who are the Tok'ra?
CARTER
Uh. Basically, they're an offshoot of the Goa'uld who oppose them
philosophically in every way.
DOLLEN
(incredulous)
You propose to bring these Goa'uld here.
CARTER
They're very different. They co-exist with their hosts in a much
truer symbiotic relationship.
[O'Neill rolls his eyes.]
TEAL'C
They are, in fact, allies.
DOLLEN
(cautious)
And they can help?
O'NEILL
(shrugs)
We'll see.
INT--PANGAR EXCAVATION CAMP--TENT, DAY
[Zenna Valk sits a table studying her notes. Jonas appears in the
doorway behind her and knocks on a box atop a table near the tent flap.
Zenna turns around.]
JONAS
Hi.
ZENNA
Hello.
JONAS
I have an admission to make. You know Teal'c and I tracked down the
Tretonin facility?
ZENNA
(smiling ruefully)
Yes, I heard.
JONAS
Yeah. Well, I did it by going through your stuff when you weren't
here. I, uh... It was wrong.
ZENNA
I know.
JONAS
(confused)
You know it was wrong or...
ZENNA
I know what you did. I saw you.
JONAS
Really? 'Cause I thought that we were... were...
ZENNA
(shaking her head)
Not so good.
JONAS
No. But you didn't try and stop us.
ZENNA
No, I wanted you to know. In some ways, I'm glad you did what you
did. In others... I'm disappointed you were so willing to betray me.
JONAS
Y'know, I never would have done this if you hadn't come to me first.
ZENNA
I should have told you outright. I was afraid. Tretonin is not
available to everyone in Pangar yet. Taking it is a privilege. One
that can be revoked.
JONAS
I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
ZENNA
No. But our relationship...
(correcting herself)
Our peoples' relationship... If we ever are to trust each other,
we're not off to a very good start.
[Jonas smiles tightly at her slip up. This isn't about a planetary
alliance. They're flirting.]
JONAS
I know.
ZENNA
(coyly)
You could make it up to me.
JONAS
How?
ZENNA
Help me finish the translations in the tomb.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, TREATMENT ROOM, DAY
[Malek and Kelmaa of the Tok'ra stand over the infected guard's bed,
scanning him. O'Neill and Carter are hanging out in the doorway.]
KELMAA
It is as though the symbiote within this man has taken a host before
it was mature enough to do so.
MALEK
And yet our scans indicate it to be a full-grown adult. Most
puzzling.
CARTER
Can you account for its lack of identity?
MALEK
As you know, memory is passed on genetically by the queen, allowing
them to be born with the collective knowledge of their lineage.
KELMAA
It is possible that the queen that spawned him was unable to pass on
this information to her progeny.
O'NEILL
Unable?
MALEK
The knowledge imparted upon her young by a queen is done so
voluntarily.
KELMAA
In this case, if nothing were passed on to the symbiote it would be,
as you say, an empty vessel.
CARTER
Can you remove it without harming the host?
MALEK
(reluctant)
Possibly. Although such a procedure would be dangerous. We would
like to see the queen that spawned this Goa'uld.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, MANUFACTURING LAB, DAY
[O'Neill, Carter, Kelmaa and Malek are gathered in front of the queen's
holding tank.]
O'NEILL
Not a pretty sight, even for a Goa'uld, huh?
[The two Tok'ra approach for a closer look.]
KELMAA
She is extremely old.
MALEK
She has been kept in this manner for decades?
CARTER
According to the Pangarans, they began using her for medical
experiments over fifty years ago. She's been breeding symbiotes to
make Tretonin for more than half that time.
[Malek and Kelmaa glance at Carter and each other, clearly surprised.]
O'NEILL
Alright now, how is that possible? I mean, how does she make kids
without a...
(trying to be tactful)
...man friend?
MALEK
Symbiote queens are able to fertilize their own eggs. It is
essentially an asexual process.
O'NEILL
(curious)
That why you guys take hosts?
[Carter and Malek look at him, unsure if he really just said that.]
KELMAA
It is impressive that a primitive human culture could develop this
process of creating such a drug.
O'NEILL
Does it bother you at all that they use Goa'ulds like this?
MALEK
No.
O'NEILL
(unsure)
Okay.
MALEK
The Goa'uld have done no worse than this to humans for centuries.
That the Pangarans can use them for a beneficial result is
surprising, but not morally objectionable to me, if that's what you
mean.
[Carter and O'Neill exchange an if-you-say-so glance.]
KELMAA
I believe her condition is the reason her offspring are not mentally
developed.
(shakes her head)
Most unfortunate.
CARTER
What is it?
KELMAA
My scans indicate massive cellular degeneration. Quite simply, she
is dying.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Dr. Fraiser sits at a computer terminal with Gen. Hammond standing
behind her. They are talking to O'Neill and Carter via the MALP.]
FRAISER
I am sorry, Colonel. The Pangarans sugar-coated the whole side
effect aspect of the drug.
O'NEILL
(onscreen)
Well, that's a shock, isn't it?
FRAISER
While Tretonin does appear to cure most diseases, it ultimately
creates far bigger problems than it solves.
CARTER
(onscreen)
How so?
FRAISER
The drug acts like a symbiote in many ways. Upon entering the user's
bloodstream, it immediately takes over, completely suppressing the
normal human immune system.
[Hammond sits down in the chair next to Fraiser's.]
FRAISER
The result is a powerful resistance to disease.
EXT--PANGAR STARGATE, DAY
[O'Neill and Carter are standing in view of the MALP camera next to the
Stargate.]
CARTER
But...?
FRAISER
(via MALP)
The healing effect is not permanent. And the user's own immune
system remains suppressed.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Fraiser and Hammond are still seated.]
FRAISER
Basically, you have to keep taking the drug for it to work.
CARTER
(onscreen)
Considering how it's made, we'd never make enough to sustain our
population.
FRAISER
I don't know how the Pangarans can make enough for their population.
CARTER
(onscreen)
They don't. Only about twenty percent are on it. And they seem to be
running into a wall as far as production's concerned.
O'NEILL
(onscreen)
They sucked the queen dry, Doc.
CARTER
(onscreen)
According to the Tok'ra, she's dying.
FRAISER
As far as I know, there's no way to reverse the drug's effects. If
their queen is dying as you say, it's just a matter of time before
anyone currently living off Tretonin will be facing death as well.
O'NEILL
(onscreen, to Carter)
Okay?
[Carter nods unhappily. O'Neill walks toward the MALP to turn the
camera off.]
O'NEILL
(onscreen)
O'Neill out.
[Hammond and Fraiser look at each other, disheartened.]
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING, DAY
[O'Neill, Carter, Dollen and Tegar wander around the room as they
talk.]
O'NEILL
So you wanted the 'gate addresses to the Goa'uld worlds, because you
wanted to snag another queen?
DOLLEN
Colonel, we have no choice but to replace the one we have.
CARTER
Exactly how did you get to this point?
DOLLEN
(taking a seat)
Sixty years ago, our archaeologists discovered a secret chamber
beneath the temple. We found a sealed canopic jar containing a
living female symbiote, perfectly preserved in stasis.
TEGAR
Through our study of the temple, we knew the Goa'uld never suffered
from illness or disease. We saw this discovery as an opportunity to
learn why.
DOLLEN
Of course, once the queen gave birth we immediately began
experimenting on her offspring's physiology, searching for a way to
mimic their seemingly perfect immune system. After decades of trying
we finally came up with Tretonin. It seemed like a miracle at first.
CARTER
Couldn't your scientists foresee the negative effects?
DOLLEN
Of course. But what we couldn't predict was our inability to refine
the drug. We were confident that we could solve the problems. We
limited the use, but ultimately we didn't see why we shouldn't reap
the benefits while working to overcome the downside.
TEGAR
We know the risks in confronting the Goa'uld. But tens of thousands
of lives will be lost if we do nothing.
DOLLEN
(rising)
Perhaps you could assist us. Now, you have faced the Goa'uld many
times. Your knowledge could give us a tactical advantage.
O'NEILL
No. There is no tactical advantage when you're dealing with the
Goa'uld.
(Dollen looks disheartened.)
We've stayed ahead of the game only because we don't bite off more
than we can chew... usually.
CARTER
Besides, we need to get you off the Tretonin, not find another
source.
DOLLEN
Our scientists have been trying for years to find a way to reverse
its effects. We've made very little progress. We need more time.
CARTER
(Ah ha)
Or... more help.
INT--PANGAR UNDERGROUND CHAMBER, DAY
[Zenna, Jonas and Teal'c are hard at work translating the fresco on the
wall.]
JONAS
(to Zenna)
This is important to you. Moreso than just curiosity about your
history.
ZENNA
As you now know, the Tretonin may not be available to us for much
longer. And when we run out those of us taking it are going to die.
JONAS
Not if we can help you find some kind of antidote.
ZENNA
Do you think that's possible?
JONAS
Anything's possible.
ZENNA
(shakes her head)
If we could find a new queen...
JONAS
(points semi-sternly)
Long term.
ZENNA
I know it's not the answer, but it could buy us a little more time
until another option is available. This has been my life's work. My
father's life's work.
JONAS
Your father.
ZENNA
My father was the one who found the jar that contained the queen. He
was attempting to remove a section of the temple ruins for further
study when he, literally, stumbled into the chamber. Of course, he
had no way of knowing that his discovery would eventually doom so
many people.
JONAS
The result is not his fault.
ZENNA
(softly)
No.
[They share a cautious smile, and Jonas turns away to look around the
room. He notices something on the far wall.]
JONAS
Teal'c.
(walks to another mural)
Didn't you say this temple was built by Shak'ran?
TEAL'C
It was.
JONAS
(pointing)
Then why does this section of the fresco mention Ra?
[Teal'c and Zenna give him their full attention.]
ZENNA
Who's Ra?
TEAL'C
Ra was a powerful System Lord, brother of Apophis. He, too, is dead.
JONAS
Well, according to this...
(checks against his notebook)
Ra used to live here.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, LABORATORY, DAY
[Kelmaa, Malek, O'Neill and Carter have gathered in the lab to discuss
their options.]
KELMAA
We will examine the drug.
MALEK
If it acts as I suspect, it may be impossible to perfect as the
Pangarans would hope. The best we might be able to do is essentially
provide an antidote that would allow their normal immune systems to
regenerate. They would not possess the superior health that they do
now.
O'NEILL
And how long would it take to go from 'theoretical' to 'enough for
everyone'?
MALEK
We can make no promises, Colonel O'Neill. However, as you say, we
are in your debt. We will begin immediately.
INT--PANGAR UNDERGROUND CHAMBER, DAY
[Zenna, Teal'c and Jonas are still hard at work.]
TEAL'C
It is possible that Shak'ran captured this world from Ra in battle.
JONAS
And built this entire temple on top of whatever Ra had here before.
(translating)
It goes on to say... something about this being some kind of prison
or... or tomb... for one of Ra's enemies. Wait a minute.
[Jonas returns to the larger fresco. He works off the mural and his
notebook as he continues.]
JONAS
"Here lies... Egeria... betrayer of the Goa'uld. May she...
suffer... for all... eternity." (pointing to a depiction of the
canopic jar)
Egeria.
(turns to Teal'c)
Doctor Jackson's notes mention her. Isn't she supposed to have been
killed?
TEAL'C
Indeed she was. But this would seem to indicate otherwise.
JONAS
That means...
TEAL'C
(oh crap)
The queen the Pangarans are breeding is not Goa'uld. She is the
origin of the Tok'ra.
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING
[SG-1 have gathered to brief each other on what they have learned.
O'Neill and Carter sit on the steps near the door, while Jonas and
Teal'c are at the near end of the table.]
O'NEILL
This could be a problem.
CARTER
(to Teal'c and Jonas)
Are you sure?
TEAL'C
The writings in the chamber are extremely clear.
JONAS
From what we can piece together, Ra used this planet as his base of
operations in this sector of the galaxy.
TEAL'C
Centuries later a rival Goa'uld named Shak'ran captured this world
in battle, forcing Ra to abandon it.
CARTER
The question is: do we tell Malek and Kelmaa?
JONAS
How can we not tell them?
TEAL'C
If we remain silent, the Pangarans will continue to use Egeria as a
source for their drug until she is dead.
CARTER
And if we don't find a way to get them off the drug, they're gonna
die eventually anyway.
[Teal'c nods gravely.]
O'NEILL
We have to tell them.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, HALLWAY
[O'Neill and Carter have just revealed the queen's identity to the
Tok'ra.]
CARTER
Please understand, we had no idea who she was until now.
MALEK
(stunned)
It is hard to believe.
KELMAA
Many of our historians speculated that Ra did not kill Egeria as was
widely believed, but...
(brightly)
We never dared hope that she would ever be found.
MALEK
She must be freed immediately, of course. Every moment that she is
kept in this condition is an affront to the Tok'ra.
CARTER
We're going to talk to the Pangarans now.
(hesitant)
It would help if you had something to offer.
O'NEILL
Like, say, an antidote?
MALEK
Unfortunately, finding an antidote to the Tretonin may be more
problematic than we had first hoped.
O'NEILL
(suspicious)
And... why's that?
KELMAA
There is something unusual about the genetic structure of the
symbiotes, beyond their lack of knowledge.
MALEK
In fact, the Tretonin should be working far better than it does, and
we're not sure why it doesn't.
KELMAA
We cannot seem to identify the defective gene that is causing its
effects to break down.
O'NEILL
But we can say you'll solve this eventually, right?
MALEK
At this moment, all I can say is it is a mystery.
O'NEILL
What, you're suddenly stumped?
MALEK
I understand the implication, Colonel. This revelation about Egeria
is in no way affecting our analysis of the Tretonin.
[O'Neill and Carter exchange a dubious glance.]
MALEK
As of right now we cannot help the Pangarans.
INT--PANGAR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING
[Carter and O'Neill are negotiating with Dollen and Tegar.]
DOLLEN
(defensively)
We could not have known. Surely, the Tok'ra don't hold us directly
responsible.
CARTER
(apologetic)
They're demanding the immediate release of their queen.
TEGAR
(incredulous)
How could we? It would doom thousands without a remedy.
CARTER
The Tok'ra have suffered great losses in the last little while.
Their numbers are severely diminished. Restoring Egeria's health may
be their only hope of survival as a people.
DOLLEN
Have they made no progress at all in reversing the effects of
Tretonin?
[Everybody looks at each other, clearly frustrated.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, LABORATORY
[O'Neill, Carter, Dollen and Tegar have rejoined the Tok'ra.]
TEGAR
(to Malek)
I'm sorry, but you ask the impossible.
MALEK
(insistent)
She is our queen. Her freedom is not open for negotiation.
DOLLEN
We deeply regret who she is, but freeing her would mean death for
many of our people.
TEGAR
Unless, of course, you can offer an alternative.
CARTER
Malek and Kelmaa are having trouble locating a particular element in
the symbiotes' genetic structure. Obviously, until they do, the
chances of synthesizing and antidote are slim.
DOLLEN
Then we have no choice.
MALEK
You do not understand. Her existence is a miracle to the Tok'ra. We
are also a dying race. You may lose thousands; our kind will become
extinct.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, MANUFACTURING LAB
[Egeria lies in her tank, bloated and dying. There is the sound of a
zat blast and someone falling to the floor. The door opens with a
squeak, and Kelmaa enters. She walks to the tank, bowing her head in
sorrow.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, LABORATORY
TEGAR
I am sympathetic to the Tok'ra, but what you are asking of us would
amount to a holocaust.
MALEK
(irate)
She is a sentient being. Using her in this manner is an insult to
her very existence.
[An aide enters and whispers in Tegar's ear.]
TEGAR
Someone has breached security in the manufacturing wing.
[Tegar accompanies the aide out, followed quickly by Dollen. O'Neill
and Carter exchange a cautious look.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, MANUFACTURING LAB
[Tegar, Dollen, Malek, O'Neill and Carter enter to find Kelmaa
unconscious on the floor.]
TEGAR
(outraged)
What has she done?!
[All but Malek stop in the middle of the room, while Malek continues to
kneel at Kelmaa's side. There is a symbiote on the floor next to her.]
O'NEILL
Uh... is that... Was that...?
MALEK
(reverently)
Kelmaa has given her life for our queen. Her host belongs to Egeria
now.
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, LABORATORY
[The group has returned to the main lab. Egeria, now in Kelmaa's host,
has been placed on the bed where the guard was earlier. O'Neill looks
idly into a microscope, and Carter stands nearby.]
O'NEILL
I bet the Pangarans would give up the queen if the Tok'ra would hand
over the antidote.
CARTER
You think they know how to save the Pangarans, and they're
withholding a cure?
O'NEILL
(off-handedly)
To get what they wanted? Yeah, sure.
CARTER
Sir, with all due respect, I disagree.
O'NEILL
(waving a random instrument at her)
Carter, they're pissed off.
CARTER
Wouldn't you be? They just discovered that the founder of their race
has been abused for the sake of medical experimentation for over
fifty years.
O'NEILL
Oh, come on, Carter. Face it. For all their high morals and fancy
preaching about (air quotes)
"coexisting" with humans, we are just a... nice place to live.
CARTER
I don't think that they would just lie outright and doom thousands
of innocent people.
O'NEILL
The Tok'ra layin' on that table in there just did.
[Dollen emerges from the exam room and approaches O'Neill and Carter.]
DOLLEN
(a little breathless)
Egeria has awakened.
[The three of them return to the treatment room.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, TREATMENT ROOM
[Malek kneels at Egeria's bedside with his head bowed in respect. She
lies on the exam bed, weak from her years of imprisonment and the
recent blending. Dollen and Tegar are stand near the door, with
O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c in the doorway itself.]
MALEK
Egeria, it is an honor.
EGERIA
Rise, Malek. You are not my servant.
[He reluctantly stands.]
EGERIA
Kelmaa was generous in giving her life to free me, but I am afraid
it is too late.
MALEK
Save your strength, my queen. Your people need you, now more than
ever.
EGERIA
Kelmaa's assessment of my condition was correct, Malek. My time is
almost done. I shall not live long enough to see more of my
children.
[Malek looks away for a moment, despondent. Egeria takes his hand
between hers in comfort.]
EGERIA
My host has shared her knowledge of the Tok'ra with me.
(proudly)
You are beyond my greatest hopes and dreams.
[Malek glances away again, uncomfortable at such blatant praise from
the dying queen.]
MALEK
(indicating the team)
These are the Tau'ri, who have allied themselves with the Tok'ra.
EGERIA
I know.
(to Carter)
Come forward.
[Carter steps reluctantly into the room and goes to Egeria's bedside.]
EGERIA
My host tells me you seek to help the Pangarans despite what they
have done to me.
[Carter and Dollen cringe.]
CARTER
This has all been a terrible mistake. But not a malicious act.
EGERA
Nor was mine, Major Carter.
EXT--PANGAR EXCAVATION SITE, DAY
[Zenna sits on a toppled wall that is half-buried in the hillside.
Workers toil at a column behind her, and sentries walk through on
patrol. Jonas walks off the pathway and comes to sit next to Zenna. She
fidgets uncomfortably as he begins to talk.]
JONAS
Y'know, back on my home planet, my people discovered a... a
substance that had an incredible potential to generate energy. And
after years of research, and serious lack of moral fortitude, they
used it to make a bomb.
[Zenna looks down, mildly chastened by him implied comparison.]
JONAS
Oh, that'd be the reason I left. But the point is, your people had
good intentions.
ZENNA
(nodding)
We thought we had found a cure for all disease. Now we may kill so
many of us. I am not afraid to die, but I am afraid that my people
will not have learned from this.
JONAS
(earnestly)
I think they already have.
[They smile hopefully at each other and nod.]
INT--PANGAR MEDICAL FACILITY, TREATMENT ROOM
[The Tok'ra, Pangarans and Tau'ri are arranged as before.]
EGERIA
I passed on the flawed gene that gave the drug its weakness. You
were unable to construct an antidote because of the manner in which
I sabotaged my young. I did it in the hope that they would
ultimately prove useless to the Pangarans. I wanted to force them to
abandon their research once the drug proved untenable. Instead, they
continued to make it in ever-increasing quantities.
CARTER
And now they can't live without it.
EGERIA
(smiling ruefully)
It is not what I intended.
MALEK
(reassuring)
Their fate is their own doing, not yours. You merely tried to free
yourself the only way you could.
EGERIA
They do not deserve this end, not when it can be prevented.
[Malek looks confused at her benevolent assertion. Carter has an 'ah
ha' moment.]
CARTER
You created the flaw. You can create the antidote that will save
them.
EGERIA
I will tell you what you need to know.
DOLLEN
(relieved)
Thank you. On behalf of our people, please, forgive us for what we
have done to you. Had we known, we--
EGERIA
(determined)
The salvation of the Pangarans shall be my final act. Such is the
spirit of Tok'ra that I wish to live on.
EXT--PANGAR STARGATE
[Four male Tok'ra are carrying Egeria's shrouded body on a stretcher.
They follow Malek up the stairs and into the event horizon. As the
wormhole disengages, Dollen and Tegar turn back toward the DHD where
SG-1 is waiting to go home.]
CARTER
Malek says he should have a prototype of the antidote ready soon.
TEGAR
We are grateful for his efforts, Major, and yours.
DOLLEN
It is our hope that we will be able to repair any mistrust that may
have developed between us so that we can pursue a long-lasting
friendship between our people far into the future.
O'NEILL
Well said.
[Teal'c bows. Carter walks around the DHD and dials Earth.]
