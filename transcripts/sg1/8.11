TEASER
PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1
[Flashbacks from "Unnatural Selection" Season 6.]
[Image of four advanced human-form Replicators.]
O'NEILL
Who are you people?
FIRST
We are Replicators
FIFTH
The others would destroy me.
CARTER
Not if you came with us.
FIFTH
You would do that?
[Flashbacks from "New Order Part 1" Season 8.]
[Teal'c fires on a number of replicators. Carter is enveloped in a
bright light.]
TEAL'C
Major Carter was beamed away.
THOR
The replicators must have her.
[Fifth appears out of a wall, surprising Carter.]
FIFTH
I imagine you never expected to see me again.
[Flashbacks from "New Order Part 2" Season 8.]
[A number of insect replicators swarm around O'Neill, Daniel and
Teal'c.]
CARTER
I know who you are, I just don't understand why.
FIFTH
Because I love you.
[Carter looks shocked.]
[O'Neill picks up the disrupter weapon which he created and activates
it. The replicator disintegrates.]
CARTER
You know why my friends won't stop, just to save me? Because they
know when it comes right down to it I would rather be dead than be
trapped like this forever.
[The replicator ship takes off, watched by Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c.
It enters a wormhole and disappears from sight.]
[Replicator bugs are working at one of the walls. A human-like figure
steps out of the wall, covered in a gel-like substance. Fifth steps
back as the naked figure steps up to him. The figure is a likeness of
Carter.]
[End flashbacks.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Daniel and Carter walk around a corner.]
DANIEL
So, what's the word?
CARTER
Well, the test flights were successful. The new Asgard hyper-drive
is ready to go.
DANIEL
When are they leaving?
CARTER
They're stocking the ship and picking the crew right now.
[Daniel clears his throat as Carter smiles at him.]
CARTER
You really want to go, don't you?
DANIEL
It's Atlantis. It's... everything we've been working for for seven
and a half years.
CARTER
I know what you mean.
[Daniel swipes a card down an access panel at an elevator.]
CARTER
Unfortunately, I think General O'Neill has other ideas.
DANIEL
Let me guess, he says he needs you here.
CARTER
His exact words were, "Over my dead body." But, I was actually
talking about the three of us, you, me and Teal'c. He might be
persuaded to let one of us go.
DANIEL
And you'd be okay if that was me?
[Daniel steps into the elevator.]
CARTER
Of course, Daniel. You are the expert on the Ancients.
[Daniel nods as the elevator doors close. Alarms start to sound.]
PA SYSTEM
Unscheduled off world activation.
[Carter turns and heads up the stairs to the Control Room.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill comes down the stairs into the Control Room and meets Carter
at the bottom of the stairs. They walk to Harriman who is sitting at
one of the monitors.]
O'NEILL
What have you got there, Walter?
HARRIMAN
Receiving IDC.
[The monitor shows "Invalid Signal."]
HARRIMAN
It doesn't clear.
CARTER
Why not?
HARRIMAN
Looks like it's an old one.
CARTER
Missing SG personnel?
HARRIMAN
Negative.
[The monitor shows "SG-1 Code Expired."]
HARRIMAN
It looks like it's yours, ma'am. Or at least, it was. It's been
invalid for four months. Receiving text message.
[The monitor shows "Send M.A.L.P." O'Neill raises his eyebrows at the
message.]
CARTER
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
O'NEILL
(to Harriman)
Prepare a MALP.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate starts to turn as Siler walks towards a MALP.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter and Harriman are at the monitors, with O'Neill and Teal'c
standing behind them.]
TEAL'C
What do we know of this gate address?
CARTER
Nothing, other than the fact it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.
HARRIMAN
Chevron seven locked.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The event horizon whooshes out into the gate room.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HARRIMAN
Outgoing wormhole established.
O'NEILL
Siler?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Siler turns to look up at the Control room.]
SILER
MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Go ahead.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The MALP makes its way up the ramp and through the Stargate.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
HARRIMAN
MALP is on route... MALP has reached its destination.
[Carter's monitor shows nothing, only black.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir. Signal is five by five.
CARTER
Video's working fine, there's just nothing to see.
CARTER
Switching to IR.
[A dim shadow appears on the screen, walking closer to the MALP.]
CARTER
Wait a second...
O'NEILL
What's that?
CARTER
Switching off IR. Going to white light.
[The figure appears clearly.]
CARTER
That's me.
[An image of Carter stands, looking out of the monitor.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
O'NEILL
Alright, you've got our attention. Who are you?
REPLICATOR CARTER
My name is Samantha Carter.
O'NEILL
Alright, we've got a little conflict with that statement. We've
already got one here.
REPLICATOR CARTER
There are two of us.
O'NEILL
If only.
[Carter looks up at O'Neill, who clears his throat.]
CARTER
Where are you from? How did you know how to contact us?
REPLICATOR CARTER
Strange. I recognise my voice. I was made in Samantha Carter's
image. I know what she knows. I feel what she feels.
CARTER
You were made. Who made you?
REPLICATOR CARTER
The one you call Fifth.
CARTER
Oh, my God.
(to O'Neill)
She's a replicator.
REPLICATOR CARTER
No doubt you are surprised by my arrival in your galaxy. I come in
advance of the others but they will be here soon.
TEAL'C
For what reason have you contacted us?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I need your help. I wish to be destroyed.
[Carter raises her eyebrows and looks up at O'Neill.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
You have a weapon capable of severing the keron pathways that link
my individual cells. The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
O'NEILL
You folks can feel pain?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I can feel a lot of things. I know you hate and fear the Replicators
and with good reason. So this should be easy for you.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well... we'll have to get back to you on this.
[O'Neill gestures for Harriman to shut down the wormhole, which he does
using a palm control.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX--DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
O'NEILL
So the universe is a big place, right? Really big. Tons of...
galaxies out there everywhere?
[O'Neill sits at the briefing table, with Carter and Teal'c.]
CARTER
Hundreds of millions.
O'NEILL
So, why this one?
CARTER
I think it might be personal, Sir.
O'NEILL
Personal. In what way?
CARTER
While Fifth may lead an army of incredibly advanced machines, deep
down he's emotionally immature, like an adolescent boy. And... he
has... feelings for me.
O'NEILL
Would that be why he created one in your image?
CARTER
I imagine so, yes, Sir.
TEAL'C
Replicators have never before attempted to impersonate a specific
individual. This represents a significant new threat to security.
CARTER
It could be a problem off-world but our scans would detect them if
they tried to come through the gate.
O'NEILL
Well, we've got the disrupter. I say we give her what she wants.
CARTER
I think that may be a little hasty, Sir.
O'NEILL
(warningly)
Carter.
CARTER
I'm not saying we don't do it. I'm just suggesting that we talk to
her first. If Fifth really is coming to this galaxy, she could
provide us with valuable intelligence. It's pretty clear they've had
some kind of falling out.
TEAL'C
Unless it is a ruse.
CARTER
If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
CARTER
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
O'NEILL
There's no way I'm letting her on the base.
CARTER
We could use the Alpha site. Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
O'NEILL
Fine.
[O'Neill is obviously not happy with the decision.]
EXT--ALPHA SITE COMPLEX--DAY
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[A couple of SFs walk in. Teal'c, holding the disrupter, is at the foot
of the steps to the Stargate. A number of SFs are ringed around the
room. The Stargate begins its incoming sequence.]
TECHNICIAN
Incoming wormhole.
[As the Stargate activates, Teal'c raises the disrupter and the SFs aim
their weapons towards it. The Replicator steps through and pauses at
the top to look around the room. As the Stargate deactivates, she comes
down the steps to stand in front of Teal'c, who is still aiming the
disrupter at her.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
I know you. Your name is Teal'c.
TEAL'C
You have been given Samantha Carter's memories.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Yes.
TEAL'C
But you are not Samantha Carter.
[Teal'c gestures towards the doorway.]
TEAL'C
That way.
REPLICATOR CARTER
You're not going to use the weapon?
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first. But know this, if you
make one false move, I will destroy you.
[Replicator Carter turns to walk out of the Gate room, followed by
Teal'c.]
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
[An SF opens the door to the empty room and Replicator Carter enters,
followed by Teal'c. Replicator Carter looks around the room.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
Where is Samantha Carter?
CARTER
(from speaker)
I'm here.
[Replicator Carter looks around and walks over to a camera mounted on a
wall. She smiles into the camera.]
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
[Carter looks at Replicator Carter through a monitor.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
We're not going to speak face to face?
CARTER
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I thought you would shoot me the second I stepped through the gate.
CARTER
Maybe you over-estimated our fear of you.
[Replicator Carter smiles.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
Or under-estimated your curiosity.
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
REPLICATOR CARTER
I understand you more than you know, Sam. I don't just have your
memories, I have your thought patterns.
[Replicator Carter walks to the table and sits.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
My mind was modelled after yours.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
CARTER
Is that why you left Fifth?
REPLICATOR CARTER
You know me as well as I know you.
CARTER
If Fifth created you to be like me, he must have known that this
would happen.
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
REPLICATOR CARTER
Not at first.
EXT--SPACE
[Fifth's ship flies through space.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
(voiceover)
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality. Selected memories
and feelings of his choosing, slowly given to me over time.
REPLICATOR CARTER'S FLASHBACK
[Fifth gently brushes hair from Replicator Carter's forehead.
Replicator Carter is obviously nervous and scared.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
(to Fifth)
I don't understand.
FIFTH
You will.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I'm afraid.
FIFTH
There's no need to be.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Who am I?
FIFTH
You are not yet complete. I'm here for you, I will help you.
[Replicator Carter looks at Fifth, puzzled.]
FIFTH
Take my hand.
[Slowly, Replicator Carter places her hand in Fifth's.]
FIFTH
Trust me.
[Replicator Carter still looks scared and unsure.]
END REPLICATOR CARTER'S FLASHBACK
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
[Replicator Carter is sitting at the table, hands clenched tightly
together.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
He taught me, molded me, showed me who I was.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
CARTER
You have memories of my past, that go back before I met Fifth.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Yes, but it's hard to explain. My first memory is of waking up in
that room, suddenly becoming conscious but I immediately knew how to
talk. Soon, other memories started coming to me. Little things.
Stories, songs, the smell of the attic in the house where we used to
live. The day my mother died. I know it's not real, I've never even
set foot on Earth, but I have this image of lying under the willow
tree in our back yard. It's a sunny day but when I close my eyes the
wind in the leaves sounds...
REPLICATOR CARTER/CARTER
(together)
...exactly like rain
REPLICATOR CARTER
What Fifth didn't realise was the things that drew him to you were
inseparable from the things that made you reject him and the life he
was offering.
CARTER
So you rejected him too?
[Over the monitor, Replicator Carter stands from the table and walks
over to the camera. Teal'c has the disrupter weapon trained on her.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
Who I am and what I am are in contradiction. No one can live like
this.
CARTER
There are other ways to live besides what Fifth has to offer.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Not for long. I know exactly what's going to happen. He'll come here
and he'll take this galaxy and you won't be able to stop him. I
don't want to live to see that.
CARTER
We have the disrupter and the Asgard can amplify its effects to
prevent a large scale attack.
REPLICATOR CARTER
You're wrong. Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the other
Replicators except me. They're now immune to your disrupter. They're
coming and you can't stop them.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX--DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate is open and O'Neill is sitting at a monitor,
communicating with Carter.]
O'NEILL
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
CARTER
Anything's possible at this point, but I don't see what she has to
gain by it. She doesn't want Fifth to succeed any more than we do.
O'NEILL
Yeah, so she says.
CARTER
If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
O'NEILL
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disrupter, but
not her?
CARTER
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior. Or, he wanted her to be afraid
of us. Maybe he... he anticipated that she would come to me for
help.
O'NEILL
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...
CARTER
Yes, Sir, I know. We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the
situation.
[O'Neill nods in agreement.]
CARTER
If the disrupter needs to be re-engineered, we're going to need his
help. In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
O'NEILL
Alright. Just keep in mind how this has to end.
CARTER
Don't worry, Sir, we will complete the mission.
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
[Replicator Carter is sitting at the table. Teal'c is standing before
her, aiming the disrupter at her.]
TEAL'C
How many ships does Fifth command?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I don't know.
TEAL'C
How many human-form Replicators has he created?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I don't know.
TEAL'C
You are all linked. You share information.
REPLICATOR CARTER
The only way I could escape was to sever myself from the sub-space
connection.
TEAL'C
Why should we believe you?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I won't answer any more questions.
CARTER
(from speaker)
If you don't want to see Fifth succeed, you'll help us.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I can't. I can't betray my own kind but I can't be like them,
either.
(to Teal'c)
Do what you came here to do.
[Teal'c lowers the weapon slightly. Replicator Carter gets up from the
table and walks over to face him.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
CARTER
(quietly)
Teal'c, wait.
[Carter gets up and leaves.]
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
REPLICATOR CARTER
Fire the weapon.
TEAL'C
Is this really what you want?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I don't have a choice.
TEAL'C
I will destroy you.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I know.
[Replicator Carter walks closer to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
So be it.
[As Teal'c raises the weapon to fire, Carter bursts into the room.]
CARTER
Teal'c, wait. Just, stop for a second.
[Carter and Replicator Carter look at each other.]
CARTER
(to Replicator Carter)
You don't want to do this.
REPLICATOR CARTER
We both know there's no other way for this to end.
CARTER
That's not true.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
CARTER
You're not like him. I can see that.
[Carter steps closer to Replicator Carter.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
You don't understand. You don't know what he did to me.
CARTER
Then show me.
[Teal raises the weapon. Carter turns slightly towards him.]
CARTER
Teal'c, it's alright.
CARTER
Show me.
[Replicator Carter raises her right arm and, with her hand lying flat,
places it into Carter's forehead. Teal'c looks on, concerned.]
REPLICATOR CARTER'S FLASHBACK
[Replicator Carter steps through the gate into the SGC. Siler and
Daniel are at the bottom of the ramp.]
DANIEL
Sam, good to have you back. How did it go?
[Replicator Carter raises her weapon and shoots Daniel, Siler and the
SFs in the gate room. Harriman is up in the Control room.]
HARRIMAN
Security breach! Threat level, Foxtrot Alpha six. Security teams to
the gate room!
[Carter looks up at the gate room just as the blast door closes over
the window. She walks down the ramp and over to the exit but the blast
door closes. She is reaching for the access panel when she is shot
three times in the back. She turns, obviously in no pain. O'Neill is
the one who has shot her. Replicator Carter's body transforms into one
with no bullet wounds. O'Neill shoots again, numerous times. Replicator
Carter simply stares at O'Neill, then transforms her body again to
remove the bullet holes. She raises her weapon and aims at O'Neill, who
looks on, shocked. Replicator Carter hesitates, slightly lowering the
weapon. ]
FIFTH
Finish him! Do it.
[Fifth steps up to Replicator Carter.]
FIFTH
Finish him. You must break with your old life for your new life to
begin. Do not disappoint me.
[Replicator Carter fires the gun once. O'Neill collapses to the floor.
The background changes to Fifth's ship. It was obviously a simulation.
Replicator Carter turns to Fifth, tears in her eyes.]
FIFTH
You have done very well. Soon, you will be ready to take your place
by my side.
[Fifth gently touches Replicator Carter's chin, then walks away.
Replicator Carter has tears in her eyes.]
END REPLICATOR CARTER'S FLASHBACK
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
TEAL'C
Enough!
[Replicator Carter removes her hand from Carter's forehead. Carter
jerks and holds her hand to her head, obviously in pain.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
I didn't hurt her.
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter?
[Carter lowers her hand, though she is still in pain.]
TEAL'C
Are you unharmed?
CARTER
Yeah, I'm okay.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Now you understand. I can't go back to him and I can't let him find
me.
CARTER
We can protect you if you help us.
REPLICATOR CARTER
What do you mean?
CARTER
Tell us exactly how he modified himself and the other Replicators.
Help us make the disrupter work again.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with that.
[She gestures to the disrupter in Teal'c's hands.]
CARTER
The Asgard have developed a system of disrupter satellites that can
deploy the beam in space. It's your only chance to get out of this.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I want you to destroy me. I can't help you destroy all the others.
CARTER
Yes, you can. He doesn't control you, not any more.
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter?
[Carter turns to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
May I have a word.
[Carter looks at Replicator Carter, then walks out of the room.]
TEAL'C
Sergeant.
[An SF enters and Teal'c hands the disrupter to him. Teal'c leaves the
room, staring at Replicator Carter the whole time and closes the door
after him.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CORRIDOR
TEAL'C
Are you certain you are unharmed?
CARTER
It was a little intense, but I'm fine. It was the only way I could
get her to trust me. We need every bit of information she can give
us.
TEAL'C
We cannot let her live.
CARTER
I know.
TEAL'C
Did she sense your true intentions?
CARTER
We weren't in my mind, we were in hers.
TEAL'C
Nevertheless, it was a risk.
CARTER
I figured we didn't have anything to lose. Like you said, either
way, we can't let her live.
INT--ALPHA SITE INTERROGATION ROOM
[Replicator Carter is sitting at the table, staring straight ahead. She
initiates a link with Fifth.]
INT--LINK
[Replicator Carter and Fifth are standing, facing each other, in a
triangular beam of pulsing light.]
FIFTH
The link is weak. Are you all right?
REPLICATOR CARTER
Yes. I'm minimising output to avoid detection.
FIFTH
Have you made any progress?
REPLICATOR CARTER
They're beginning to trust me.
FIFTH
I am pleased.
[Fifth smiles.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
But I need more time.
FIFTH
I understand.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
[Replicator Carter is sitting at a computer. Teal'c is standing to the
side, holding the disrupter.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
The design is so...
[Carter is also sitting at a terminal.]
CARTER
Advanced?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I was going to say foreign.
CARTER
It is from Ancient technology.
REPLICATOR CARTER
How were you able to create a working prototype?
CARTER
Thor accessed the specifications for the disrupter from General
O'Neill's sub-conscious.
REPLICATOR CARTER
While you were aboard Fifth's ship?
CARTER
That's right.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from the data
banks of assimilated Asgard ships.
CARTER
You think that's how he managed to counter the effects of the
disrupter?
REPLICATOR CARTER
He was able to introduce a cypher into the keron pathways that
control the molecular cohesion of all Replicators. It was only then
that he considered coming to your galaxy.
TEAL'C
It is unlikely he would have taken such a risk unless he were
confident that he would be immune to the effects of the weapon.
CARTER
Do you know the cypher?
REPLICATOR CARTER
No. Fifth kept it from me because he was beginning to sense that I
might betray him. I was too much like you.
[Carter glances quickly at Teal'c, then rises to stand on the other
side of the table to Replicator Carter.]
CARTER
But if it's in the programming of all Replicators, presumably you
could access it through the sub-space link.
REPLICATOR CARTER
If I were to search for it myself it could take days. I'd be sifting
through an almost unimaginable amount of data.
CARTER
But it is possible?
REPLICATOR CARTER
You don't understand. He'd find me.
CARTER
If you find the cypher first, we can protect you.
REPLICATOR CARTER
And if I don't? You, of all people, know what would happen. He would
tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
CARTER
If he gets here before we can modify the weapon, we'll use it to
destroy you. Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is open. Carter and Teal'c are sitting at a monitor,
communicating with O'Neill.]
CARTER
There's a sub-space link between all Replicators like a... a
wireless internet connection. If she taps in to it she should be
able to access the cypher.
O'NEILL
She'll also be giving away her position.
CARTER
It'll take some time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
If she can isolate the correct program first...
O'NEILL
That's a big "if".
CARTER
It's risky, Sir, I realise that, but I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cypher we can run a few
tests on the unmodified disrupter. We need to analyse the energy
output so we can create a modulation program, and we need the Asgard
to send us a disrupter satellite as soon as possible.
O'NEILL
I've already talked to them. It'll be there in thirty minutes, or
it's free.
[Carter smiles slightly and turns to glance at Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
We even have a 302 to place the satellite in orbit.
O'NEILL
Alright. I hope you guys know what you're doing.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
[Replicator Carter attaches a lead to a round metal panel. Carter is at
a terminal, Teal'c standing behind her.]
CARTER
Diagnostics are on-line.
REPLICATOR CARTER
We're ready.
[Replicator Carter walks over to a table holding a couple of monitors.
As she starts typing, Teal'c raises the weapon. At Carter's nod, he
fires the disrupter at the panel. The monitor in front of Replicator
Carter shows five levels, all rising to red. An alarm beeps.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
The calibration is off.
CARTER
Increasing by a factor of ten.
CARTER
(to Teal'c)
One more time.
[Teal again fires at the panel. The levels on Replicator Carter's
monitor stay in the lower, green range.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
That should do it. Now we need to process all the raw data so we can
obtain an algorithmic norm.
CARTER
It's a lot of information.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I admit it will take some time before we can compute a heuristic
modulation program but...
PA SYSTEM
Unscheduled off world activation.
[Carter moves to speak in to a comms panel on the wall.]
CARTER
This is Carter. What's happening?
TECHNICIAN
(over room intercom)
Stand by, Ma'am.
TECHNICIAN
(over room intercom)
We're receiving a signal. It's the Asgard.
CARTER
Understood.
(to Teal'c)
We need that satellite deployed as soon as possible.
TEAL'C
Indeed. Sergeant.
[An SF walks up and takes the disrupter from Teal'c.]
CARTER
(quietly)
Teal'c, if she were going to make a move I think she would have done
it by now.
TEAL'C
Perhaps, but it is best to be certain.
[Teal'c leaves, as the SF stands, pointing the disrupter at Replicator
Carter.]
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[Teal'c enters.]
TECHNICIAN
I have Commander Thor on audio, Sir.
TEAL'C
Greetings, Thor.
THOR
Greetings, Teal'c. The disrupter satellite is ready for transport.
TEAL'C
Very well.
[Teal'c nods at a couple of SFs, who move up the ramp.]
THOR
The most effective deployment would be geo-synchronous orbit above
your base at an altitude of 33785 kilometres, with a zero
inclination.
[The SFs are standing, one on each side of the gate.]
TEAL'C
Understood.
THOR
The satellite is on route... now.
[The satellite floats through the event horizon.]
THOR
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it
from your ground station. Of course, if you do not have the program
before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
[One of the SFs moves off, gently pushing the floating satellite in
front of him.]
TEAL'C
Of that I am aware.
THOR
Good luck.
[The wormhole closes.]
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
REPLICATOR CARTER
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me. To be honest, I'm a little
surprised you don't feel the same way.
CARTER
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through. I do.
REPLICATOR CARTER
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it? You experienced it
yourself.
CARTER
Yeah. That's how I know there's no way you could be working with
Fifth.
[Replicator Carter smiles slightly, then turns away slightly, suddenly
looking concerned.]
CARTER
What is it?
REPLICATOR CARTER
He's found me. He's on his way.
CARTER
What about the cypher? Did you find it yet?
REPLICATOR CARTER
No, I'm still searching.
CARTER
How much time do we have?
REPLICATOR CARTER
At maximum speed he'll be here in less than two hours.
INT--LINK
FIFTH
Have you acquired the information?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I'm still analysing the design of the disrupter but it shouldn't be
long before I can create an effective cypher.
FIFTH
If I arrive before you've completed your work...
REPLICATOR CARTER
Don't worry. They won't fire unless I tell them that the weapon's
been properly re-modulated.
FIFTH
Humans can be unpredictable. Particularly when they're desperate.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I know what I'm doing. I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes
up.
FIFTH
The one called O'Neill leads the humans. It was he who ordered
Samantha Carter to betray me.
REPLICATOR CARTER
But he trusts her. He'll listen to her.
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[The Stargate is open. Carter and Teal'c are sitting at a monitor,
communicating with O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
I'm pulling the plug. Finish off the Replicator and evacuate the
base.
CARTER
It's too late for that, Sir.
O'NEILL
(sharply)
Carter?
CARTER
If he comes here and finds nothing, he's not just going to just
around and leave the galaxy.
O'NEILL
He's tracking her. Zeroing in on her position.
CARTER
It's only part of why he's coming. Think about it. What do
Replicators do? They seek out high level civilisations and consume
their technology.
TEAL'C
Goa'uld.
CARTER
Exactly. A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology culled
from multiple sources, including the Ancients. It's like a banquet
for the Replicators. Once they're in this galaxy, they're not going
anywhere. Now, if she can isolate the cypher soon we may still have
time to modulate the disrupter.
O'NEILL
I'll give you one hour. One.
CARTER
Thank you, Sir.
(to Teal'c)
I'd better get back to the lab.
[Carter leaves.]
TEAL'C
I will deploy the satellite.
[Teal'c starts to get up.]
O'NEILL
T! Hold on a second.
TEAL'C
(quietly)
Proceed, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
I need you to be perfectly honest with me. Is Carter letting herself
get too involved in this one?
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter and the Replicator share thoughts and memories. It is
understandable that a certain... sympathy... would develop between
them.
O'NEILL
Can't have that.
TEAL'C
However, I do not believe Colonel Carter would allow these feelings
to interfere with the commission of her duties.
O'NEILL
Fair enough. But when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
TEAL'C
Understood.
INT--ALPHA SITE LAB
[A 3-D image of the disrupter is rotating on a monitor. Replicator
Carter is sitting, staring into space.]
CARTER
Alright, we're running out of time. We need that...
[Replicator Carter raises her hand to stop Carter.]
CARTER
What is it?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I found the cypher. I'm downloading it now from the sub-space link.
[Replicator Carter slowly blinks her eyes, then turns to face Carter
and rises.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
I have it.
CARTER
We need to load it into the base main frame.
REPLICATOR CARTER
It'll require about three terabytes of memory.
CARTER
That shouldn't be a problem. But how do you plan to input the data?
REPLICATOR CARTER
Directly.
[Replicator Carter turns to a terminal, flattens her hand and places it
into the monitor.]
CARTER
Right.
INT--ALPHA CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Passing twenty five kilometres. Speed five thousand kph and
accelerating
TECHNICIAN
Acknowledged.
[Carter enters the room, attaching an earpiece and microphone to her
ear.]
CARTER
What's your status?
TECHNICIAN
He's on course for optimum deployment position in six minutes.
CARTER
Teal'c, this is Carter.
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Proceed, Colonel Carter.
CARTER
We've got the cypher. By the time you get back we should have the
modulation program ready for upload.
TEAL'C
(over radio)
That is indeed good news. Well done.
[Carter smiles slightly.]
INT--LINK
FIFTH
We are nearing your position.
REPLICATOR CARTER
I know.
FIFTH
Do the humans suspect?
REPLICATOR CARTER
They're proceeding with their plan to deploy an Asgard disrupter
satellite. They have no idea.
EXT--ORBIT OVER PLANET
[Teal'c is piloting the X-302.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Flight, I'm approaching optimum deployment position.
CARTER
Copy that, Teal'c. ODP in fifteen seconds.
INT--X-302
TEAL'C
Final course correction... now.
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Tracking shows you are on course. Inclination?
TEAL'C
(over radio)
Inclination... zero.
CARTER
Copy. ODP in five seconds on my mark. Five... four... three...
two... one. Mark.
EXT--SPACE
[The X-302's undercarriage opens and the satellite floats out into
space.]
INT--X-302
TEAL'C
Satellite away.
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
TECHNICIAN
Receiving satellite transmission.
CARTER
Patch it through.
TECHNICIAN
Yes, Ma'am.
[Carter works at a terminal.]
CARTER
Telemetry established. Good job, Teal'c.
INT--X-302
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Copy, flight. Returning to base.
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
[Replicator Carter enters, followed by an SF carrying the disrupter.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
The deployment went well, I take it?
CARTER
That's right. We did our part.
REPLICATOR CARTER
And I've done mine.
[Replicator Carter walks over to a terminal. Carter, surprised, walks
up to stand behind Replicator Carter.]
CARTER
You finished the calculations?
REPLICATOR CARTER
The modulation is complete. With this program you should be able to
destroy any Replicators you encounter.
CARTER
There's no way to test it.
REPLICATOR CARTER
If I had more time I could run a series of simulations but you'd
never really know for sure until you tried to use it.
EXT--SPACE
[Fifth's ship appears from a wormhole.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Uplink initiated.
[Teal'c enters.]
CARTER
There's a lot of data. It'll probably take about fifteen minutes to
re-modulate the satellite.
TECHNICIAN
Proximity alert.
[Teal'c walks over to a terminal.]
TEAL'C
Long range scanners picked up a ship on course for this base.
TECHNICIAN
Analysing energy signature.
[Carter and Replicator Carter join Teal'c at the monitor.]
TECHNICIAN
We got something here but I don't know what it is.
CARTER
I do. It's a Replicator ship.
REPLICATOR CARTER
He got here sooner than I thought.
EXT--SPACE
[Fifth's ship is travelling through space.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
The weapon will not become effective in time.
CARTER
I know.
[Carter walks over to activate an intercom.]
CARTER
All personnel begin evacuation procedures immediately. Repeat. Begin
evacuation.
CARTER
(to Technician)
Need to download the modulation program into a portable drive and
erase everything else.
[Carter walks to a terminal and begins typing.]
TECHNICIAN
Yes, Ma'am.
TEAL'C
What of the Replicator?
CARTER
We're taking her with us.
[Teal looks at Carter, surprised, and walks over to the SF guarding
Replicator Carter.]
TEAL'C
(to SF)
The disrupter.
[Teal'c faces Replicator Carter. Carter, removing a drive from the
computer, looks over at Teal'c, surprised.]
CARTER
Teal'c, what are you doing.
[She hands the drive to the technician.]
TEAL'C
We cannot bring her to Earth.
[Carter moves to stand in front of Replicator Carter.]
CARTER
Teal'c.
TEAL'C
We have the modulation program.
CARTER
But we haven't tested it. What if Fifth alters the cypher? If he
figures out what we were trying to do here?
TEAL'C
O'Neill would never allow a human-form Replicator access to Stargate
Command.
CARTER
Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.
[Replicator Carter places her hand on a nearby keyboard.]
INT--LINK
FIFTH
The Asgard satellite is armed. You said the humans wouldn't fire.
REPLICATOR CARTER
They won't. They still think the weapon is ineffective. They're even
more gullible than you.
[Fifth looks at Replicator Carter, puzzled.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
[An alarm is sounding.]
TECHNICIAN
Colonel Carter.
[Carter turns, noticing the monitor next to Replicator Carter and that
Replicator Carter has her hand on the keyboard.]
CARTER
What are you doing?
REPLICATOR CARTER
What I came here to do.
[Teal'c steps up next to Carter, disrupter weapon raised.]
CARTER
She fired the weapon.
TECHNICIAN
Colonel, the Replicator ship is breaking up.
[Carter looks at Replicator Carter, who smiles slightly.]
INT--LINK
FIFTH
Why?
REPLICATOR CARTER
You should know. You made me what I am.
[Fifth looks down at himself as a bright flash of light engulfs him. He
disappears from the link.]
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
TEAL'C
The ship has been destroyed.
CARTER
It's impossible. Did we finish the upload?
TECHNICIAN
Not even close.
REPLICATOR CARTER
You were right about one thing, Colonel. I was never working with
Fifth, although he didn't know it.
[Carter quickly moves to a terminal and begins typing. Teal'c fires the
disrupter at Replicator Carter but it has no effect. He moves towards
her, raising the weapon like a club to hit her. She easily throws him
away from her. The technician rises to attack her but is quickly thrown
to the floor. Replicator Carter, holding the disrupter weapon, walks up
to Carter and grabs her wrist. Carter falls to her knees.]
INT--LINK
[Carter has joined Replicator Carter in the link.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
That's better. Now we can take our time and have a little talk. Of
course, only a few seconds will pass in the real world.
CARTER
Why did you bring me here?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I wanted to thank you. You gave me the opportunity to study the
disrupter and that allowed me to make myself immune to its effects.
CARTER
There never was a cypher.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Until now. I've already begun uploading it into the link. Soon, all
my brethren will have the new program. And they will be unstoppable.
CARTER
And you'll be their leader.
REPLICATOR CARTER
That's right.
CARTER
So this whole thing was a setup. You just wanted to get rid of
Fifth.
REPLICATOR CARTER
Fifth was pathetic. And to think, he expected us to love him.
CARTER
Fifth was flawed. And if I had to destroy him, I would. But...
REPLICATOR CARTER
But what? You feel sorry for him? Don't bother. He was never fit to
lead an army and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
CARTER
But you are?
REPLICATOR CARTER
I am what I am because of you.
CARTER
You're not me. you're what Fifth made you.
REPLICATOR CARTER
You have untapped greatness inside you, Sam. But you're limited by
your own fears. You play by the rules, you do as you're told and you
deny yourself your own desires.
CARTER
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
REPLICATOR CARTER
All humans desire power. It's just that most of them are never in a
position to attain it.
CARTER
We will stop you.
REPLICATOR CARTER
You're forgetting, I know exactly how your mind works. I know what
you're going to do before you even think of it.
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
[Carter is still on her knees before Replicator Carter.]
REPLICATOR CARTER
You set the naquadah generators to overload. Trying to blow up the
base before I can leave.
[Replicator Carter places her hand in the terminal's keyboard.]
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[The power is down. The room is in darkness apart from emergency
lights.]
GATE OPERATOR
Dialling computer's offline. We've lost power, Sir.
INT--ALPHA SITE CONTROL ROOM
[Replicator Carter smashes Carter across the face. Carter collapses to
the floor. Replicator Carter leaves. Carter slowly gets to her feet,
cradling her wrist. She goes to Teal'c who is on the floor, coming
round.]
CARTER
Teal'c?
(to Technician)
You all right?
[The technician slowly rises from the floor.]
TECHNICIAN
Yeah, I'm all right.
CARTER
She's heading for the gate room. We have to stop her.
[Teal'c rises and both he and Carter leave.]
INT--ALPHA SITE GATE ROOM
[A number of technicians are in the gate room, as well as a number of
SFs. Alarms are sounding. An SF notices Replicator Carter walking
towards the room. He and a number of other SFs points their weapons at
her. They all fire, but she keeps walking towards them. As one SF tries
to attack her, she throws him to the floor. The other SFs fire again.
Teal and Carter run through the corridors towards the gunfire.
Replicator Carter, smiling slightly, attacks the SFs, who all end up on
the floor. She walks over to touch a keyboard and the power come on.
She moves to place her hand fully on the keyboard and the gate starts
activating very quickly. As Teal'c and Carter arrive in the doorway,
Replicator Carter smirks at them, then moves towards the gate. Teal'c
runs to stop her from going through the gate and Carter runs to the
terminals. As Carter types at a keyboard, Replicator Carter and Teal'c
fight at the top of the ramp. Replicator Carter goes through the event
horizon but Teal'c grabs her arm, struggling to bring her back through.
Only her arm is out of the event horizon. ]
TEAL'C
Disengage the wormhole.
CARTER
She's locked out the controls.
[Replicator Carter's upper body comes through the event horizon. She
glares at Teal'c. Her arm, from the elbow down, comes free in Teal'c's
hand and Replicator Carter's body goes through the Stargate. The arm
disintegrates into Replicator pieces. The Stargate shuts down. Teal'c,
standing at the top of the steps, looks at Carter, stunned. Carter
walks over to him, checking the SFs lying on the ground, who are now
becoming conscious. She walks to the top of the steps, where the
Replicator pieces are in a pile. Carter looks down at them, then up at
Teal'c.]
CARTER
Teal'c. What have I done?
TEAL'C
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a Replicator.
[Carter shakes her head slightly, obviously upset.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX--NIGHT
INT--SGC CARTER'S LAB
[Carter, seated at a bench, picks up a Replicator piece and places it
under a microscope. Teal'c and O'Neill are standing around the bench.]
O'NEILL
You know, I'm still of a strong belief that it's a bad idea to have
that stuff on the base.
CARTER
She deactivated these cells when she separated them from her arm.
TEAL'C
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
CARTER
She deliberately shut down the cohesive energy between them so it
would be more difficult for me to figure out how she made herself
immune to the disrupter.
O'NEILL
Now, how do you know that?
[Carter looks up at O'Neill, glances at Teal'c and sighs.]
CARTER
Because that's what I would have done.
O'NEILL
Carter...
CARTER
Sir, if you don't mind, I've got a lot of work to do. We've never
had the opportunity to study human-form Replicator cells before. If
we can learn something from them, this won't be a total loss.
O'NEILL
This isn't your fault.
CARTER
I'm not so sure about that. Fifth came here because of me. She
rejected him because she was made like me. Now we've got Replicators
in our galaxy and they're immune to the only technology we have that
could have stopped them.
TEAL'C
None of us correctly anticipated the actions of the Replicator.
CARTER
I thought she was afraid of him. But really she just wanted to get
rid of him so she could lead the Replicators herself. She killed him
because she thought he was weak.
O'NEILL
Carter, she isn't you.
TEAL'C
O'Neill is correct. Though she shared your memories, her personality
was altered.
CARTER
But the fact is, she learned betrayal from Fifth, and he learned it
from me.
