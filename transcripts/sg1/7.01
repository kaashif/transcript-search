TITLE
Fallen Part 1
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[A group of four unfamiliar people, possibly natives, are walking and
talking. One is an old man. The others are younger, perhaps in their
20s. They are wearing robes. There are ruins. Some of the archways look
like those on Kheb ("Maternal Instinct").]
SHAMDA
The new animal took a look around and immediately went and chose a
place next to the laziest, greediest beast in the stable. When the
master saw this, he put a yoke on him at once and took him back to
the merchant.
KHORDIB
(sounds exasperated)
We've heard this one already.
SHAMDA
Has it lost its meaning?
KHORDIB
I mean you told it just now on the way down to the waterhole.
[There is a sudden bright flash of light. Camera spirals in slowly from
overhead on a man lying naked on the ground. The nomads approach the
figure. Close up of blues eyes opening, looking afraid and bewildered.
One of the natives moves closer.]
KHORDIB
Who are you?
[We now see clearly that the naked man is Daniel Jackson. He eyes the
nomad warily.]
DANIEL
I don't know.
[End teaser. Credits.]
EXT--SGC
[Truck leaving SGC tunnel.]
INT--SGC--OFFICE OF DANIEL JACKSON/JONAS QUINN
[Jonas is sitting at a desk in the lab/office. He is reading some
papers and the tablet taken from Abydos ("Full Circle"). He references
a book he takes from a shelf then appears to discover something.]
JONAS
I got it.
[Jonas runs down an SGC corridor, reminiscent of Daniel running through
the corridors in "Small Victories." We see Teal'c up ahead.]
JONAS
I got it. Teal'c! Teal'c! I got it.
[Jonas pats Teal'c on the shoulder with the book then continues his
run, leaving Teal'c behind.]
JONAS
I got it. I got it.
[Jonas bumps into Siler on his way to the elevator.]
JONAS
Oh, sorry, uh, Tyler--Siler--Master Sergeant Siler. Siler.
[NOTE: This is one long tracking shot that takes us through the SGC
corridors.]
INT--SGC ELEVATOR
[Jonas enters elevator. NOTE: Martin Wood (Director) makes a cameo
appearance here as the elevator occupant.]
JONAS
Twenty-eight, please.
[Jonas walks up to Martin Wood's character. He puts his hands on his
shoulders and pushes/shakes him excitedly.]
JONAS
It's not the lost city. See, there's a subtle difference in meaning
when you use Asgard translations of early Ancient. Remember that.
[The elevator doors open and Jonas departs.]
JONAS
Excuse me. Watch it, watch it.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Jonas enters the control room. Sergeant Davis is present.]
JONAS
Hey, where's Major Carter?
DAVIS
Uh, she--she's in, uh, Hammond's office.
[Jonas heads upstairs to Hammond's office. We can hear Carter.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
CARTER
According to intelligence provided by the Tok'ra, Anubis is quickly
decimating the forces of the remaining system lords.
[Jonas pauses in the doorway to catch his breath.]
JONAS
I got it.
CARTER
Hopefully, it's not contagious.
JONAS
Ha, ha. The lost city.
[Hammond waits expectantly for more.]
JONAS
On the tablet.
CARTER
You found it?
JONAS
Yeah, only it's not the lost city. That never made sense to me
anyway. I mean, the tablet is written in ancient. How could they
lose one of their own cities? And even if they did, why would they
call it the lost city? They wouldn't. They would call it by its
name, right?
HAMMOND
Mr. Quinn...
JONAS
It's not the lost city. It's the city of the lost.
CARTER
Do you have a Gate address?
JONAS
There's a reference in some partial translations that Doctor Jackson
was working on from the library of the four races. It talks about a
city of the Ancients called Vis Uban as being a place where the
plague began. This was going to be the crown jewel in the entire
ancient domain. Only it was still under construction when the plague
broke out.
CARTER
Two words: Gate address.
JONAS
Four years ago, when Colonel O'Neill had the ancient repository of
knowledge downloaded into his mind, one of the things that he did
was to put a bunch of new Gate addresses into the SGC computer. How
many did he put in there?
CARTER
Well, we've been sending probes and cataloguing them as fast as we
can.
HAMMOND
Any possibly relevant planet goes on the mission list.
JONAS
Yeah, well how many have actually had probes sent to them?
CARTER
Less than a quarter.
JONAS
And do you think that he came up with these, ah, Gate addresses
randomly? Or could there be some sort of order?
CARTER
Yeah, I suppose...
JONAS
If Vis Uban wasn't finished being built at the time the entire
Ancient civilization fell...
CARTER
You're saying the Ancient city we're looking for is the last one on
the list.
JONAS
Well, we've been going in order from first to last, right?
HAMMOND
(to Carter)
Send a probe.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[Carter leaves. Jonas nods at Hammond.]
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[We see SG-1 and other SGC personnel, possibly another SG unit, walking
away from the Stargate. The area looks to be fairly barren.]
O'NEILL
We're not talking about a common cold here, Carter. It was the
plague.
CARTER
Sir, we don't wear a hazmat every time we step through the Gate.
There's always a chance we could be exposing ourselves to something
dangerous.
O'NEILL
Well, the place is called the City of the Dead.
JONAS
The City of the Lost, actually, sir.
O'NEILL
Not for lack of a sense of direction.
EXT--NOMAD VILLAGE
[SG-1 makes their way through a small gathering of natives. They are
wearing the same type of clothing as the nomads who found Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Well, these folks don't look lost--nor dead.
JONAS
I don't think that these are the Ancients. I mean, anything's
possible, but, ah, they look like some sort of, ah, nomadic tribe
that's just taken up residence.
KHORDIB
(the same good-looking young man who found Daniel in the opening
teaser)
Greetings.
JONAS
Greetings. We're...travellers from a planet called Earth.
KHORDIB
You came through the chappa'ai?
JONAS
The Stargate. Chappa'ai.
KHORDIB
(points at Teal'c)
He is Jaffa.
O'NEILL
No, but he plays one on TV.
JONAS
This is Teal'c. He's no longer allied with the Goa'uld. He's a
friend, as are we.
KHORDIB
We too are travellers. This place is not our original home, but...we
have been here for some time now. If you wish to lay claim...
JONAS
No. No, no, nothing like that. We just want the opportunity to learn
more about your people and, uh, take a really good look around these
ruins.
EXT--NEAR STARGATE
[SG unit sets up camp.]
FEMALE
We need to sweep the area, sir.
MALE
Maintain a secure perimeter, fifty meters radius from the Gate.
FEMALE
Yes, sir.
MALE #2
Sir.
[Daniel approaches from a wooded area and the SG members turn towards
him and keep their weapons trained on him. They appear to recognise him
and partially lower their weapons.]
EXT--NOMAD VILLAGE
KHORDIB
(to Shamda)
They are travellers like us. They say that they are friends.
SHAMDA
No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust them.
O'NEILL
Don't judge a book by its cover.
SHAMDA
Enemies promises were made to be broken.
O'NEILL
And yet, honesty is the best policy.
SHAMDA
He that has too many friends has none.
O'NEILL
Ah, but birds of a feather...
SHAMDA
I'm unfamiliar with that story. What lesson does it teach?
O'NEILL
It has to do with flocking...and togetherness...and...to be honest,
I'm not that familiar with the particulars myself. The point is,
we're not your enemy. Give us a chance to prove it.
[Reynolds enters from behind.]
REYNOLDS
Colonel.
[O'Neill turns to see approaching SG unit]
REYNOLDS
We found something you might want to see.
[The rest of the SG unit accompanies Daniel down the stairs. O'Neill,
Carter and Teal'c walk towards Daniel.]
O'NEILL
(voice breaking)
Daniel?
KHORDIB
Arrom.
O'NEILL
Arrom?
KHORDIB
It's what we call him.
SHAMDA
It means naked one.
KHORDIB
That's how we found him in the forest, two moons ago.
REYNOLDS
Seems he doesn't remember who he is.
CARTER
Daniel?
[Carter approaches Daniel, smiles and reaches out to touch his
shoulder.]
CARTER
It's okay. It's me, Sa-
[Daniel puts his hand up to stop her from touching him. Carter looks
devastated.]
TEAL'C
Do you not recognize us, Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
I'm sorry.
[Daniel walks away. The team turn to watch him go.]
O'NEILL
(Shouts after retreating Daniel)
Not even me?
INT--NOMAD TENT
[Daniel is sitting in a tent. O'Neill enters.]
DANIEL
Please leave me alone.
[O'Neill ignores Daniel's request and sits opposite him.]
O'NEILL
I'm Jack O'Neill. And, barring some freakish similarity, you are Dr.
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
This tent is all I know. These people, they're all I know. Before I
woke up in the forest, I don't remember anything. I've tried. I've
tried to remember who I was before. Sometimes I think it's right
there, floating in front of me, and all I have to do is reach out
and grab it. I try--and it's gone.
O'NEILL
You were a member of my team, SG-1. You're a friend of mine. Last
year, you died.
DANIEL
I'm dead?
O'NEILL
Obviously not. You just sort of died. Actually, you...ascended to a
higher plane of existence. Last time I saw you, you were helping us
fight Anubis.
DANIEL
Anubis?
O'NEILL
Yeah. Kind of an over-the-top, clich bad guy. Black cloak, oily
skin, kind of spooky. Anyway, obviously since then, you've retaken
human form, somehow. I--
[O'Neill pauses as his words register and he shakes his head.]
O'NEILL
Actually, I can how this might sound a bit unusual...
DANIEL
A bit? Why am I here?
O'NEILL
Hey, why are any of us here?
(grimaces)
Honestly, I don't know, but you've got to trust me. You are Daniel
Jackson. Think of it this way: out of all the planets in the galaxy,
why this one if not for us to find you? (points at Daniel)
DANIEL
(Sceptically)
So you're saying a higher power had a hand in putting me here?
O'NEILL
I don't know. That was generally your department.
EXT--VILLAGE
[Carter is asking questions or being given information.]
CARTER
Thanks very much.
KHORDIB
You're welcome.
[Carter walks over to O'Neill who is exiting the tent.]
CARTER
Jonas and Teal'c are helping SG three and five begin the preliminary
sweep.
O'NEILL
Remember when I said it was like talking to a wall?
CARTER
Sir, we know someone who's ascended can chose to retake human form.
O'NEILL
You think he also chose to forget everything?
CARTER
Maybe the part about his memory isn't voluntary. Who knows? Maybe
the whole thing is punishment for trying to help us. He did say he
was breaking some pretty big rules.
O'NEILL
So...what?
CARTER
It's going to take some time to search the entire extent of the
ruins. There could be weapons or a power source hidden just about
anywhere. In the mean time, we try to help Daniel remember--if
that's even possible.
O'NEILL
Tag. You're it.
INT--DANIEL'S TENT
[Carter pauses before entering.]
CARTER
Can I come in?
[Daniel blows out a candle he has just lit, leaving the interior of the
tent fairly dim.]
DANIEL
Sure.
CARTER
(sitting down)
So...
DANIEL
What did you say your name was again?
CARTER
Samantha Carter. You used to call me Sam.
DANIEL
Yeah, well, like I already told Jim--
CARTER
Uh, Jack.
DANIEL
Jack? Yeah, I told him...
CARTER
I guess what I don't understand is why you aren't dying to know all
about who you are.
DANIEL
I am. And I'm not.
CARTER
See, it's the not part...
DANIEL
What if I don't like who I was? What if I don't want to be that
person? What if I don't have it in me to make up for something I've
done wrong?
CARTER
I have to admit, that never occurred to me. Look, we all thought
we'd lost you at one point.
(intense voice)
It was one of the hardest things I have ever been through. You
were--you are--brilliant. One of the most caring, passionate...
You're the type of person who would give his own life for someone he
doesn't even know.
DANIEL
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
CARTER
If you had one fault, it was that you wanted to save people so
badly, y--you wanted to help people so much, that it tore you apart
when you couldn't make a difference.
DANIEL
That actually sounds kind of hard to live up to.
CARTER
All I know is that if I were you, I would definitely want to get to
know me--you.
DANIEL
I get it.
CARTER
Come back with us. Let us show you who you are instead of just
telling you.
DANIEL
I'll think about it.
CARTER
OK.
[Carter starts to rise, about to leave.]
DANIEL
Samantha Carter?
[Carter stops at the tent entrance and turns back to Daniel.]
CARTER
Yeah?
DANIEL
Was there ever anything between us?
CARTER
(Surprised)
Us, uh... No, no, not in that way. We--we were really, really good
friends.
DANIEL
OK.
(Small smile and nod of the head)
EXT--OUTSIDE TENT
[Carter rejoins O'Neill who is walking in with Shamda.]
O'NEILL
Carter. Shamda here was just telling me a story about...a dog and
some dancing monkeys.
SHAMDA
The moral of which is: appearances can be deceptive.
O'NEILL
(puts hand on Shamda's shoulder in a friendly fashion)
I got that. Very good story. Wonderful! Full of nuances. I like
that.
[Teal'c and Jonas approach.]
JONAS
We, uh, we sent up a UAV.
TEAL'C
The ruins are quite extensive.
JONAS
Yeah, it's going to take us weeks to scour this place properly.
TEAL'C
What of Daniel Jackson?
DANIEL
(exits tent)
He's going home.
[Camera zooms in on a determined Daniel Jackson.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Hammond watches as the team returns with Daniel. Daniel looks over his
shoulder at the wormhole as he exits and as they approach Hammond,
O'Neill uses both hands to indicate Daniel to him.]
HAMMOND
Welcome back, Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
Thank you. Thank you very much.
[Daniel looks around curiously.]
HAMMOND
You have no memory of who I am?
DANIEL
None whatsoever.
O'NEILL
Neither do I, sir.
[Hammond gives O'Neill a reproving look.]
[O'Neill looks apologetic then beckons Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Uh, that way.
[O'Neill leads Daniel out of the Gate room. The rest of the team
follow.]
O'NEILL
Did I mention you owe me fifty bucks?
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is concluding an examination of Daniel. O'Neill enters.]
FRAISER
Well, I'm happy to say, sir, that he's in perfect health, except for
one small exception.
[Fraiser hands Daniel a pair of glasses which he puts them on with
instinctive ease.]
DANIEL
Wow, that's different.
O'NEILL
(adopts a hopeful, eager smiling expression)
You recognize me now?
DANIEL
(examines Jack thoughtfully)
Has your hair always been that way?
O'NEILL
What way?
DANIEL
Never mind.
INT--SGC GUEST ROOM
[Camera pans around the room showing a number of archeological items
obviously belonging to Daniel.]
[O'Neill opens the door. Daniel enters.]
O'NEILL
Not exactly home but we unpacked some of your stuff.
DANIEL
(examining an item)
You kept all this even though you thought I was dead?
O'NEILL
To be honest, we tossed out a ton of junk... (O'Neill sees Daniel's
reaction and adds)
A lot of which seemed to be very valuable.
[Daniel puts down item. He sees a photo of a woman on the nightstand
next to the bed. It's Sha're. He picks it up.]
O'NEILL
(nods over at the items near the bed)
I...kept a few of your personal things alive, there.
DANIEL
(staring at photo)
I know her.
O'NEILL
(hopeful)
Really?
DANIEL
I mean, I must, right?
O'NEILL
Yeah...
DANIEL
Who is she? What's her name?
O'NEILL
(Gives Daniel a steady look)
You tell me.
[O'Neill leaves Daniel to examine the possessions on his own, closing
the door behind him. We see SFs outside in the corridor.]
INT--SGC DANIEL'S ROOM
[It's dark. Daniel is asleep on top of the bed. He gasps, wakes up and
looks at the photo of Sha're.]
INT--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
[Teal'c is surrounded by candles, trying to kel-no-reem. There is a
knock at the door and Daniel stands at the doorway.]
DANIEL
Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
TEAL'C
You are not. I am unable to kel-no-reem as I once did since I began
using tretonin.
DANIEL
Well that sounds complicated.
TEAL'C
Indeed. Enter.
[Daniel walks in and sits in a chair while Teal'c rises and sits on his
bed.]
[Daniel holds up the photo of Sha're and shows it to Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Her name is Sha're.
TEAL'C
Yes.
DANIEL
No one told me that.
(very pleased with himself)
I remembered that by myself. I dreamed about her and when I woke up,
I knew her name.
TEAL'C
That is good news, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Yeah, it's the first time I've believed I might have a chance. You
know? If I can remember a name, then there's a chance it's all in
there somewhere, right?
(excited about the prospect of his memory returning)
TEAL'C
(very gently)
Indeed.
DANIEL
So-so where is she?
[Teal'c looks grief-stricken.]
DANIEL
She's dead.
[Teal'c nods once in confirmation.]
DANIEL
And I loved her very much.
[Teal'c is silent.]
[Daniel places the photo faced-down on a nearby table. He takes a deep
breath then clasps his hands in front of him, collecting himself. His
voice is less soft, more businesslike, more determined.]
DANIEL
This being, Oma Desala, is supposedly very powerful, right?
TEAL'C
That is correct.
DANIEL
Why would she do this? I mean, if she wanted me to forget...
TEAL'C
You often spoke of the rules to which you were subjugated as one of
the Ascended. Perhaps she was required to erase your memories by
laws of the Others, but as your friend and mentor, she wished you
one day to regain it.
DANIEL
You're saying she cheated? You think she found a way around the
rules?
TEAL'C
You do not agree?
DANIEL
Tell me about this Anubis. Why did I break the rules to fight him?
TEAL'C
Do you not believe it wise to remember on your own accord?
DANIEL
No. I need to know why this is happening to me.
[Teal'c nods.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond and SG-1 are in the Briefing Room. Daniel is absent. Jonas is
standing at the head of the table, a screen behind him. He is
presenting information to the others.]
JONAS
At this point we believe that we've mapped the full extent of the
ruins.
O'NEILL
No fancy guns or anything cool?
JONAS
Well, we've only completed a preliminary investigation...
[Daniel and an SF walk downstairs into Briefing Room.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry I'm late I, uh...
(he glances at his watch)
...forgot what time the meeting was.
[Daniel smiles at the others but it fades when the others regard him in
silence.]
DANIEL
It's a little joke there. It's the memory thing.
HAMMOND
Doctor Jackson, this briefing is classified.
DANIEL
Yeah, Jonas mentioned that but, uh, you all said that I used to be a
part of this, so... Look, I can't really give you a good reason, I
just feel like I should be here.
[O'Neill looks at Hammond then back at Daniel.]
HAMMOND
Good enough.
[Daniel walks over and takes a seat next to Carter at the table,
opposite O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Besides, who am I going to tell? I mean, I don't, uh, I don't
remember anybody, right?
O'NEILL
(smiles faintly)
Good one.
DANIEL
(mumbles to the table whilst smiling)
Thanks, Jim.
[O'Neill looks taken aback and a little upset. He looks at Carter for
her reaction and she tries to hide a grin.]
JONAS
Oh, so, uh...There are extensive writings. All of them are in the
oldest known Ancient dialects. All of them have yet to be translated
but, uh, so far, we haven't found any signs of any advanced weapons
or power sources. I mean, the original name of the city is Vis Uban
which does translate as place of great power but there's no
indication that we're going to find any means of defeating Anubis
there.
DANIEL
You're not.
(O'Neill looks at Daniel)
It's not the lost city.
O'NEILL
How do you know?
DANIEL
Uh, because Jonas translated lacun to mean 'of the lost'.
JONAS
Yeah, but that's how we found-
DANIEL
(interjects)
The wrong place.
JONAS
The translations in your notes-
DANIEL
Also wrong--if these are the ones you mean. I was...way off.
JONAS
Well, how do you know that?
DANIEL
I don't know. I--I just--I know what the tablet says.
O'NEILL
How?
DANIEL
I don't know. I just looked at it and understood it.
CARTER
Wait a minute. Are you saying the Ancients actually lost one of
their own cities?
DANIEL
No, no, they didn't lose it. They--they made it lost. To other
people that might try to find it. I'm guessing that they camouflaged
it and removed all reference to it from the written history.
O'NEILL
So. The lost city is...still lost?
DANIEL
I'm pretty sure.
O'NEILL
(accusing)
You know, you told me to give Anubis that eye.
CARTER
According to reports from our allies, Anubis is quickly conquering
the other system lords.
TEAL'C
He will dominate the galaxy in a very short time.
O'NEILL
I only did it because you said we could whup ass with what we find
in this lost city.
DANIEL
Wh-if I said that, then I-I hope it's true, but...but Look, all I
know is that the place you're searching right now is not it.
O'NEILL
Then where is it ?
DANIEL
Did I just say 'all I know'?
O'NEILL
(glares at Daniel)
Everyone turn away. I want no witnesses.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Jonas arrives at Daniel's quarters and knocks on the door.]
DANIEL
(off screen)
Yeah.
INT--SGC DANIEL'S QUARTERS
DANIEL
Hey.
JONAS
Sorry to bother you.
DANIEL
No. No you're not. I was just, uh...uh, reading about us, actually.
JONAS
You said that Anubis was part-Ascended. That the Ancients tried to
send him back to our level of existence, but failed, and now he's
trapped somewhere in between.
DANIEL
Yeah, so I've heard.
JONAS
Anubis wouldn't know know everything there is to know about the
Ancients, then, right? Otherwise, he would have already found the
lost city.
DANIEL
Look, I know I was able to read that tablet...but
JONAS
I-I'm just thinking out loud here. If Anubis were to accidentally
find the tablet, chances are that he's not going to make the same
mistake I did.
DANIEL
I don't know.
JONAS
But if we were to make a replica of the tablet--you know, change
what it says...
DANIEL
Why?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Teal'c is standing at the base of the ramp wearing Jaffa armour, minus
helmet. He heads through the active Gate, alone.]
INT--SGC OFFICE/LAB
[Daniel is writing on the board while Jonas checks through books.]
INT--SGC CARTER'S LAB
[Carter and some members of the Tok'ra are looking at a hologram plan
of Anubis' ship.]
EXT--ALIEN PLANET WHERE DANIEL WAS FOUND
[One of the nomads is scraping dirt away from what looks like part of a
Goa'uld ring transporter.]
INT--YU'S SHIP
[Teal'c approaches and kneels in deference to Yu.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter is making a presentation to the room. Occupants consist of
O'Neill, Daniel, Hammond, Jonas, members of the Tok'ra and unknown
people, some in uniform.]
CARTER
As you all know, we've had little success using Naquadria to power
the F-302's hyperspace generator for any length of time. However, if
our calculations are correct, we believe that a short, controlled
burst would send the 302 into subspace just long enough to bypass
the mother ship's shields.
O'NEILL
And if your calculations are incorrect?
CARTER
The 302 would bypass the mother ship all together, or worse,
re-emerge inside it. But let's not go there right now.
O'NEILL
Of course. Let's not dwell.
CARTER
Now, uh, uh, according to intelligence provided by the Tok'ra, the
power core of Anubis' new weapon must be cooled by a ventilation
shaft on the exterior of the ship. If that can be targeted and
destroyed just as the weapon is powering up, the crystals will over
heat and be destroyed.
O'NEILL
Where is the shaft, exactly?
CARTER
(looking irritated)
As Colonel O'Neill is well aware, we don't know exactly where the
shaft is.
TOK'RA FEMALE
Our operative in Anubis' ranks has been unable to get aboard the new
ship and has only been able to glean a very limited working
knowledge of it. Anubis protects his computer systems with elaborate
ciphers coded in the oldest known Ancient dialect. We have been
unable to translate them.
CARTER
Which is where Jonas Quinn and Daniel Jackson come in. They'll sneak
onto Anubis' ship and access the computer.
TOK'RA FEMALE
We have devised an injectable radioactive isotope that will allow
them to move freely on Anubis' ship, undetected by its sensors, for
eight hours.
CARTER
They'll decipher the codes and relay the location of the target to
Colonel O'Neill and myself, who will be flying the F-302.
O'NEILL
No problem, right?
JONAS
Hey, sounds easy to me.
[Daniel gives a thumbs-up.]
O'NEILL
Good. Anubis' ship is destroyed and we all live to save another day.
CARTER
(gives a thin smile)
Again, as the Colonel is well aware, we have reason to believe that
eliminating the crystal power core of the ship's main weapon won't
destroy the entire ship. It's defences and auxiliary weapons will
remain intact.
O'NEILL
Why don't we dwell on that for just a minute?
CARTER
Our goal is to take out Anubis' new super weapon. It's what gives
him a clear advantage over the rest of the Goa'uld mother ships.
Now, we've received word from Teal'c that Yu has pledged to bring
the full force of the remaining system lords' fleet down on Anubis
once we've succeeded.
O'NEILL
Okay.
(speaking to the room)
Everyone who thinks this is absolutely an insane idea, raise your
hand. Come on, be honest.
[Everyone raises their hand, including Carter.]
HAMMOND
Keep your hands up, people, because the next question is who is
going to make this happen?
[O'Neill shrugs and keeps his hand up along with everyone else.]
JONAS
Well it's going to take us at least a week to relocate the
inhabitants of the ruins...
CARTER
Which will give us more than enough time to build a makeshift runway
and get the 302 through the Gate and reassembled.
JONAS
Once everything is established the Tok'ra will plant our fake tablet
and, with any luck, we'll lure Anubis to the planet.
HAMMOND
Let's move.
[Carter turns the lights back on as people leave the room, leaving
O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Jonas.]
O'NEILL
Look, I realize I wasn't the most positive voice in the room...
CARTER
We all know it's an extreme long-shot, sir.
O'NEILL
Well, my big problem with it is that all this depends on us trusting
a Goa'uld to back us up.
CARTER
This is our only chance to take Anubis completely out of the picture
and Yu has come through for us in the past.
O'NEILL
All I'm saying--just for the record--this is the wackiest plan we've
ever come up with.
CARTER
Wackier than strapping an active Stargate to the bottom of the
X-302?
O'NEILL
(walks away)
Oh, yeah.
CARTER
Wackier than...than blowing up a sun?
O'NEILL
(walking through the door to leave the room)
Yep!
CARTER
(to Daniel and Jonas)
He's probably right.
INT--YU'S SHIP
[Yu's First Prime approaches as Yu is preparing to enter his
sarcophagus.]
FIRST PRIME
My Lord, the fleet is ready.
YU
I say when the fleet is ready.
FIRST PRIME
Of course, my Lord. It is time we move them in to position to
prepare for the ambush of Anubis. As you agreed, my Lord.
YU
Speak to me as if I am a fool again and you will not take another
breath.
FIRST PRIME
Yes, my Lord.
[Yu lowers himself into the sarcophagus.]
YU
Move the fleet into position.
[The sarcophagus closes on Yu.]
INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM
[O'Neill and Daniel are getting ready for the mission. O'Neill's locker
is open and Daniel notices a photo taped to the door of O'Neill's
locker.]
DANIEL
That's your son.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
DANIEL
Charlie, right. He's why I know you. You took that first mission to
Abydos because you thought it'd be...suicide.
O'NEILL
(matter-of-fact)
Things change.
DANIEL
Yeah, sorry.
O'NEILL
You sure you're ready for this?
DANIEL
Yeah, well, despite what you say...I don't think you'd be doing this
if it wasn't worth doing.
O'NEILL
(ironic smile)
Well, you obviously don't remember everything. You never used to
follow my lead.
DANIEL
(surprised)
I didn't?
[O'Neill smiles, gets up and begins to walk out.]
DANIEL
Hey, um, I may not remember everything, but...I remember enough.
O'NEILL
(smiles)
Good.
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[SGC base camp set up with camouflaged tent and equipment.]
[Carter, dressed in a flight suit, walks over to greet Hammond, Sgt
Davis and others who are just arriving.]
CARTER
(salutes)
Sir, welcome to base camp.
HAMMOND
(returns salute)
Thank you, Major.
CARTER
I have to admit, sir, it's a little strange to see you offworld.
HAMMOND
Well, this is not your usual, run of the mill, alien planet
operation, is it, Major?
CARTER
No, sir.
HAMMOND
What's our status?
CARTER
We're ready to go, sir. HAMMOND
You'd better get yourself out to the F-302, then.
CARTER
(salutes)
Yes, sir.
[Hammond returns the salutes and Carter leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[We see a fleet of six mother ships.]
INT--YU'S SHIP
[Teal'c is being briefed by Yu's First Prime.]
FIRST PRIME
We have just received word that Abubis' ship will be arriving in the
system momentarily.
[Teal'c bows in acknowledgement.]
EXT--ALIEN PLANET
[The F-302 is waiting to launch from a newly prepared makeshift runway.
Inside the cockpit is O'Neill with Carter in the second seat behind.]
SGT DAVIS
(over speaker)
Airstrike, this is command base. You are a go for take off.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I thought we were going with Red Leader on this one.
CARTER
All systems go, sir.
O'NEILL
Uh, command? There is one more thing...
HAMMOND
(from base camp)
Colonel. Major. Godspeed.
O'NEILL
All right, that's better.
(drops goggles down over his eyes)
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
[F-302 takes off.]
EXT--SPACE
[A mothership emerges from hyperspace near the planet. It's Anubis. The
folding doors that slide back to reveal the eye-enhanced weapon we saw
used in "Full Circle" open.]
EXT--NOMAD VILLAGE
[Five Jaffa transport down to the village via rings. The people are
gone, their relocation apparently successful. Two guards guard the
rings while the other three move off]
[Daniel is hiding behind a column, holding a zat gun. Both guards are
taken out with zat blasts. Major Reynolds appears, having apparently
taken out the guards. Daniel and Jonas emerge from cover. Reynolds and
his team prepare to stand guard and give cover on the surface while
Jonas takes the transporter ring control off a downed Jaffa.]
[Jonas joins Daniel on the transporter rings platform.]
JONAS
(to SG team)
Thanks, guys.
REYNOLDS
Good luck.
[Daniel and Jonas ring up to the ship.]
EXT--SPACE
[The F-302 is fast approaching Anubis' ship.]
O'NEILL
Holy crap! Look at that thing. It's huge!
CARTER
I think they know we're coming, sir. Tally four gliders, nose, 400
kilometers.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP
[Jaffa are marching along a corridor while Daniel and Jonas hide. The
Jaffa pass and they break cover, down the corridor from where the Jaffa
have just left. They come to a door and Daniel lies down on the floor
ready to provide cover from any Jaffa inside the room as Jonas deals
with the door controls. As Jonas opens the door Daniel zats the two
Jaffa near the control panel/console. Jonas closes the door while
Daniel works on the console, examining files on the holographic
screen.]
EXT--ANUBIS' SHIP
[The F-302 is nearing its target.]
O'NEILL
Extending. Max burn. CARTER
You're heading right for them, sir.
O'NEILL
I wanna see what this thing's made of.
CARTER
I could tell you exactly, sir.
O'NEILL
Another time, maybe. Please?
[O'Neill spots four death-gliders approaching them. He waits for the
right moment then fires.]
O'NEILL
Fox four, two. Pitching back left, one, four, three, five.
CARTER
(via radio)
Daniel, Jonas, we are under attack. We need that intel.
DANIEL
(via radio)
We're close.
CARTER
We can't hold these guys off for long.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP
[There is the sound of armoured Jaffa trying to enter the room Daniel
and Jonas are in.]
JONAS
Great...we got company.
[Jonas moves to the door panel.]
EXT--SPACE
[Yu'S fleet.]
FIRST PRIME
My Lord.
YU
(via communication screen)
Take the fleet to Chodawwa.
FIRST PRIME
My Lord, that is across the galaxy. We are in position to ambush
Anubis according to the-
YU
Do not question me! I am your God! Do as I say!
[Yu ends the communication.]
TEAL'C
You cannot.
FIRST PRIME
I have no choice.
FIRST PRIME
(to a nearby Jaffa)
Take him to a holding cell.
TEAL'C
If you abandon this opportunity to eliminate Anubis, you are dooming
yourself and your master as well.
(as he is being dragged away)
FIRST PRIME
I must do as my God commands.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP/THRONE ROOM
[Anubis' First Prime approaches his master.]
HERAK
My Lord.
(bows)
Our ground troops have confirmed that there is a human base on the
planet.
ANUBIS
The search of the city?
HERAK
No energy signatures.
INT--CONSOLE ROOM
[Jonas has doctored the door controls to prevent the Jaffa outside from
entering.]
JONAS
All right. That'll hold them off for a while. A little while.
DANIEL
That's it. I'm in.
(Information appears on the holographic screen)
Uh... This may take more than a little while.
JONAS
Well, can't you do some kind of a...keyword search?
DANIEL
Yeah? For what? Achilles?
JONAS
Well, that's good. I'm glad to see that your-your memory's finally
coming back. Not to mention your razor-sharp wit, but why don't we
try something like, uh...power-core venting?
[Daniel appears to try something, possibly Jonas' suggestion.]
DANIEL
That's it. That's it.
DANIEL
(via radio)
Jack, Sam, we got it. Transmitting data.
EXT--SPACE
[The F-302 is under fire.]
INT--F-302
O'NEILL
We gotta go, Carter.
CARTER
Sir, I've got the target data but we need Anubis to power the
weapon.
EXT--ALIEN PLANET/SG BASE CAMP
HAMMOND
Airborne, we have not heard from Teal'c. The Goa'uld fleet is long
overdue.
O'NEILL
(over radio)
Gee... I had a problem with this plan.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP/THRONE ROOM
HERAK
My Lord, the attack vessel continues to elude our gliders.
ANUBIS
Send in another squadron.
HERAK
I do not believe what you are searching for is here.
ANUBIS
I agree.
HERAK
Shall I target their base, my Lord?
ANUBIS
No. Recall the ground troops.
HERAK
Yes, my Lord.
INT--CONSOLE ROOM
[Daniel and Jonas are still trapped. The Jaffa are still trying to get
into the room.]
JONAS
I don't think that we're going to get back to the ring room that
way.
DANIEL
(sees something on the screen)
What's that?
JONAS
They're targeting the planet.
(via radio)
Base camp, this is Jonas, come in.
DAVIS
Go ahead.
JONAS
(over radio)
Your position's been compromised. The Stargate is being targeted.
Repeat, the Stargate is being targeted. The naquadah will amplify
the blast.
EXT--BASE CAMP
HAMMOND
Roger that. Evacuate all personnel.
EXT--SPACE/ANUBIS' SHIP EXTERIOR
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
O'NEILL
We're going in NOW, right?
CARTER
We need the Goa'uld mother ships here to finish the job.
(sees four signals on instrument panel/console)
Sir! We've got four more gliders headed this way.
O'NEILL
Are we going in now?
CARTER
Activating hyper-drive.
[Hyperdrive is activated and F-302 exits past defences and very close
to Anubis' ship.]
O'NEILL
Extending, straight up.
EXT--SURFACE OF ANUBIS' SHIP
O'NEILL
Damn. That was close.
CARTER
Transferring target data to your terminal, sir.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP/THRONE ROOM
HERAK
My Lord, the human attack vessel has breached our shields.
ANUBIS
Shoot it down
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP--CONSOLE ROOM
DANIEL
Let's get out of here.
JONAS
Yeah.
[The door is being forced open as Daniel and Jonas look for a way out.]
DANIEL
(indicates a ventilation)
Here.
[Jonas gives Daniel a boost up so he can get to the ventilation shaft.]
JONAS
Go, come on.
[Daniel reaches the opening as the Jaffa burst into the room. The Jaffa
hit Jonas but Daniel is clear--for the moment.]
EXT--F-302 AND EXT ANUBIS' SHIP
[O'Neill is evading Anubis' defence cannons.]
O'NEILL
Target is locked. Fox four, two.
[O'Neill fires missiles at the target. There is an explosion.]
CARTER
Nice shot, sir.
O'NEILL
Well, thank you, ma'am.
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP/THRONE ROOM
HERAK
We've been hit. The core is overloading. We must power down the
weapon.
INT--POWER-CORE SHAFT
[Camera zooms down a twisting long shaft and presumably the power-core.
It explodes.]
INT--VENTILATION SHAFT
[We see Daniel shaken about by the explosion.]
INT--ANUBIS' SHIP/THRONE ROOM
[Hreak looks back at his master. Anubis roars with rage.]
EXT--ANUBIS' SHIP
[Effects of the explosion can be seen streaking through Anubis' ship.
The F-302 flies clear of the ship.]
INT--F-302
[Close up of O'Neill's face.]
INT--VENTILATION SHAFT
CARTER
(via radio)
Daniel, come in. Do you read?
DANIEL
(into radio)
Yeah, I'm still on the ship. Hey congratulations, I think you guys
hit the mark.
INT--F-302
O'NEILL
(sounds pleased with himself and happy)
Thanks, it was fun.
CARTER
We'll wait until Anubis' ship clears out and rendezvous with you at
the Stargate as planned.
INT--VENTILATION SHAFT
DANIEL
Yeah, as far as that goes, we may have a little problem.
INT--ANOTHER ROOM ON ANUBIS' SHIP
[Jonas is on his back, strapped to a table by a yoke that goes across
his neck and wrists. Anubis turns off the force-field sealing the cell
shut and enters.]
ANUBIS
You will suffer greatly.
JONAS
Yeah, I figured as much. Although, I am consoled by the fact that we
succeeded in destroying the power source for your new weapon.
ANUBIS
You are in no position to gloat.
JONAS
We just wiped out your single advantage you had over the Goa'uld. I
would say that that's about as good a reason as any.
ANUBIS
Enough!
JONAS
I won't tell you anything.
ANUBIS
Oh. Yes you will.
[Anubis pulls out a round device with spikes all over it and holds it
so that Jonas can see. It's the memory probe previously used on Thor.]
