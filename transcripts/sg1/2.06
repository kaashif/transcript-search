TITLE
Thor's Chariot
TEASER
INT--CONTROL ROOM/GATE ROOM
[Major Carter is at the see-through star chart drawing a line bisecting
two red lines radiating out from the center. General Hammond, O'Neill,
Daniel, and Teal'c look on.]
CARTER
P5C-629 is located directly in the corridor the Goa'ulds used to
reach our solar system. This is our best platform for the Seeker
Project. Now, the theory is that a Goa'uld ship that magnitude
should leave a footprint, even at thrust beyond lightspeed. So we're
using the technology we already possess we can determine...
[The klaxons sound and everyone looks around.]
HAMMOND
What the hell...? No one's due back today.
[The group head to the Command Console.]
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
(To Hammond)
We have an inbound traveler. No SG signal code.
INT--GATE ROOM
[Armed SFs pile in through the blast doors and take up defensive
positions before the Gate. The iris is closed.]
PA SYSTEM
Intruder alert. Inbound traveler is unauthorized. Inbound traveler
is unauthorized.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM COMMAND CONSOLE
[Hammond and the team watch and wait. Momentarily, the wormhole
disengages and the iris opens with no indication that anyone came
through. They continue to look on, puzzled.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond listens as Major Carter explains while walking over to the
conference table where O'Neill is seated. Daniel and Teal'c are also
seated at the table.]
CARTER
There was no organic residue, but they did pick up a faint nuclear
signature. Traces of iridium.
DANIEL
Iridium. That's the radioactive stuff we put in the Sagan Institute
box on Cimmeria.
CARTER
You got it. I wanted it there so it would leave a very recognizable
signature and...
DANIEL
Same stuff?
CARTER
Yeah.
O'NEILL
Weren't the locals supposed to give that box to...Thor? Whoever,
whatever he is.
TEAL'C
We assume he's a member of the Asgard, an extremely advanced
culture.
O'NEILL
The fact of the matter is, we really don't know.
DANIEL
The Asgard must've gotten the box and sent an answer. General, we
have to respond before they leave.
O'NEILL
Um, you all know I take great pride in my title as Mr. Positive.
However, we did destroy their de-Goa'ulding thing. Might not they
look unkindly on that?
DANIEL
We did that to save Teal'c. I'm sure the Asgards didn't expect to
trap a Jaffa who isn't an enemy. I'm sure they'd understand.
[All look to General Hammond.]
HAMMOND
(After a moment to think)
All right. I'll tell you what. We'll send a probe though at 1300
hours. If everything checks out, you have a go.
[Daniel nods approvingly.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Technicians are launching the MALP through the activated Stargate.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM--COMMAND CONSOLE
[The computer monitor shows the MALP's Molecular Deconstruction in
Progress. SG-1, Hammond, and the Female Technician.]
CARTER
The probe should be there...now.
[O'Neill reaches down and presses a button. Images appear on the
monitor. There are dead Cimmerians lying about the Cimmerian Gate.]
TEAL'C
Those wounds have been caused by staff weapons.
[The MALP camera pans a bit and they see that one of the dead is Jaffa.
The Jaffa soldier has what appears to be a bird tattooed on his
forehead.]
O'NEILL
Friends of yours, Teal'c?
[The monitor shows the destroyed mechanism of Thor's Hammer.]
TEAL'C
Clearly Cimmeria is no longer safe from the Goa'uld.
[The camera pans and a fleeting image of a woman appears momentarily on
the screen.]
DANIEL
Whoa! Pan right.
[The technician pans the area and Gairwyn is seen holding a dead
Cimmerian and pleading with the camera. She cannot be heard.]
DANIEL
That's Gairwyn. The woman who showed us around. She's saying
something.
CARTER
Turn up the gain on the MALP's mike.
GAIRWYN
(Weeping)
Please...The Etins have come. Please help us. Please...The Etins
have come. Please help.
END TEASER
ROLL OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[General Hammond leads SG-1 up the spiral staircase from the Control
Room and into the Briefing Room.]
DANIEL
Cimmerians use the word Etin for Goa'ulds. Gairwyn said the Etins
are there. For a thousand years Cimmeria was safe from Goa'uld
attack. Then we show up and screw up Thor's technology.
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson is correct. The Goa'uld usually send an advance scout
though the Stargate to determine a planet's worth and vulnerability.
If none of the scout reports back, it is a deterrent to invasion.
CARTER
The point is, sir, the Goa'uld are there and the locals aren't
exactly much of a match for them.
O'NEILL
General, if we did screw up their world, we should take a little
responsibility for fixing it, don't you think?
HAMMOND
I understand that. But let me play devil's advocate for a moment
here. It's not our world. Is it really any of our concern?
TEAL'C
The destruction of the hammer device to save my life may have caused
this.
[Teal'c steps forward.]
TEAL'C
If so, I am responsible.
O'NEILL
(Also stepping forward)
General, I gave the order.
DANIEL
(Also stepping forward)
And I fired the staff at the machine.
[Carter sheepishly steps forward.]
CARTER
And I...was there.
[Hammond looks at them, slightly exasperated.]
O'NEILL
To answer your question, sir, yes, I think we should be concerned.
[Hammond looks away for a moment, then looks back at the team.]
HAMMOND
All right. But keep your heads up on this one.
EXT--CIMMERIAN STARGATE
[The Stargate is active. The dead Jaffa lies near the DHD. O'Neill
steps through the event horizon, followed by the rest of the team. They
look around the abandoned area.]
CARTER
No hostiles in sight, sir.
[Stepping to the DHD, Carter bends down to look at one of the Cimmerian
victims. Teal'c checks out the Jaffa, while Daniel goes over to the
destroyed Thor's Hammer. O'Neill looks around and behind the Stargate
he sees something and gapes at it.]
O'NEILL
Holy...
[Just over the rise, he spies a pyramid under construction.]
O'NEILL
Kids...
[They all look at what he's seeing.]
O'NEILL
Now, that...is no weekend hunting lodge.
[A twig snaps, and they turn at the noise raising their weapons.
Gairwyn comes out of the bushes and goes to them.]
DANIEL
Gairwyn!
GAIRWYN
You returned! Kendra said you'd come. She never doubted it.
[They rush towards her. Daniel and Carter clasp her hands.]
CARTER
What happened?
GAIRWYN
We thought it was Ragnorock.
DANIEL
That's the Norse Armageddon. The end of the world.
GAIRWYN
There was fire in the heavens. Five or six bursts in the sky in a
straight line. But no sound. Then we heard an evil thunder and a
great metal point came through the clouds.
TEAL'C
A Goa'uld Ha'tak.
(O'Neill looks at him)
A pyramid ship.
O'NEILL
Ahh.
GAIRWYN
Kendra knew it was the Etins, even before the burning and killing
started. Our village is gone and most of our farms.
DANIEL
You said Kendra knew we'd come. How?
GAIRWYN
She gave me a box. She said to fly it through the portal. She said
you'd know what it meant. The cost of sending it was great.
CARTER
The men who died here?
[Gairwyn moves closer to the bodies.]
GAIRWYN
My husband and his brothers.
CARTER
(Whispers)
I'm sorry.
[A staff weapon blast comes out of nowhere and hits the DHD. They see
off to the side two Jaffa. One has his staff weapon pointed, the other
is blowing some kind of horn to alert the other Jaffa. Carter and
O'Neill grab Gairwyn and pull her away.]
O'NEILL
All right. Get under cover. Teal'c!
[Carter and Daniel take Gairwyn out of the line of fire while O'Neill
and Teal'c take cover by the broken hammer and begin firing their
weapons. A volley of weapons fire is exchanged.]
O'NEILL
Ahh.
[O'Neill squats down behind the Hammer, and pulls out a grenade.
Pulling the pin, he lobs the grenade over to where the two Jaffa start
to charge and it explodes behind the Jaffa, sending them flying. Teal'c
and O'Neill both stand, weapons raised waiting. Then more Jaffa show
up.]
O'NEILL
(Patting Teal'c on the arm)
Let's go!
[They take off into the woods as the reinforcement Jaffa give chase,
occasionally firing off a shot--one of which hits a tree. The Jaffa
continue to chase and shoot at Teal'c and O'Neill as they run further
and further into the forest. Eventually, the Jaffa come to a clearing
and look around, having lost their quarry. Signaling each other, they
take off in another direction as we see O'Neill and Teal'c huddled
behind a large tree trunk.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST--A DIFFERENT PART
[Gairwyn leads Daniel and Carter through the forest. Upon hearing the
sound of some underbrush rustling, they stop quickly, take cover and
draw their weapons. Gairwyn draws a sword from the scabbard slung
across her back. The hear footsteps and Gairwyn leaps out of the
underbrush at a startled Colonel O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Aaah!
[Seeing that it's safe, all lower their weapons and catch their breath]
O'NEILL
Everybody all right?
CARTER
Yeah.
O'NEILL
All right. Where to?
DANIEL
Well, as a former Goa'uld host, Kendra would probably be a help. Can
you take us to her?
[Gairwyn looks at them hesitatingly, then accedes.]
GAIRWYN
This way.
[Gairwyn walks away and the team turn and follow her.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[Gairwyn leads the way through the forest and into a clearing marked
with animal antlers and other ceremonial adornments. It is clearly a
gravesite.]
GAIRWYN
Kendra and her family reside here. Hopefully she is now with Thor.
[Gairwyn goes to stand beside Kendra's grave.]
GAIRWYN
My dearest friend. Kendra used her knowledge only to heal. And this
was her reward. They've already killed over half of our people.
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST--KENDRA'S GRAVESITE
[Teal'c and O'Neill wander around the site, while Daniel is seated
nearby. Carter is looking over some of Kendra's possessions. which are
carefully placed near the grave.]
GAIRWYN
It's customary to leave a person's favourite items outside their
grave to take with them on their journey to Thor. These items are of
no use now to any of us. They belong with Kendra.
[Carter sits down and is fitting a ribbon device onto her fingertips.
Daniel is watching her a little nervously.]
DANIEL
Sam?
[Carter holds up her hand examining the device. Suddenly the stone in
the center of her palm begins to glow, startling her. She turns her
palm away and the stone darkens. Gairwyn alarmingly looks at Daniel,
who rise rises quickly from his seat.]
GAIRWYN
(To Carter)
You possess the power!
CARTER
What?
DANIEL
Well, that would make sense, wouldn't it?
CARTER
Why?
DANIEL
Well, Kendra retained the ability to use Goa'uld technology because
she was a host to a Goa'uld. You must retain the ability because you
were a host to Jolinar.
CARTER
Yeah, but...I-I have no control over this.
GAIRWYN
Kendra said it took her years to master the magic of the power.
[O'Neill walks up to them.]
O'NEILL
Are we ready to move outta here?
DANIEL
Uh...Little discovery here. Carter seems to have the ability to use
Goa'uld technology.
O'NEILL
Really? Let's see.
CARTER
Well, I-It seems to have a mind of its own, sir.
GAIRWYN
Concentrate.
[Carter turns her palm down and begins to focus. In a moment, the hand
device begins to give off some kind of ray, then a blast from the
device punches a hole in the ground. Daniel, O'Neill and Gairwyn are
started by this revelation, as is Carter. She turns her palm up.]
O'NEILL
Hey! Hey! Watch where you're pointin' that thing!
CARTER
Sorry.
DANIEL
Well you realise what this means? Sam could use one of these ribbon
devices to help us fight the Goa'ulds! She could use one of those
healing devices we saw Kendra use.
[Carter puts on the healing device and aims it.]
DANIEL
Just...concentrate, like you did with the other thing.
[Carter struggles to focus her energy on the healing device, but
nothing happens. She stops.]
GAIRWYN
You mustn't give up. You must strive to master control of the power.
It takes time.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well, that's going to have to wait. Why don't you bring that
stuff with you? We should find a place that's a little less public.
GAIRWYN
Let me show you where my people hide.
[Carter gathers up items as Gairwyn leads them away from the
gravesite.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[Gairwyn and SG-1 forge through the forest until they come upon a rocky
outcropping covered in moss. There is a doorway, and Gairwyn leads them
through.]
INT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[Other Cimmerians are gathered within the torch-lit cave. Kettles are
set up in the makeshift home for the populace. Gairwyn enters with SG-1
following and the Cimmerian see them and stand, pulling their swords.]
OLAF
Halt!
GAIRWYN
Olaf, these are friends. They came to us through the ring.
OLAF
(Angrily)
These are the dogs of Midgard. Thor has abandoned us to the Etins
because of them, because they destroyed Thor's hammer! It is these
that brought this down on us!
GAIRWYN
And it is these who can save us! With their help, we can still
summon the power of Thor.
OLAF
Don't you understand, woman? Thor has abandoned us because of their
evil.
O'NEILL
For crying out loud. Don't you understand that this woman is right?
We can help you if you'll let us.
OLAF
How?
CARTER
We've fought the Goa'uld before and we've beaten them.
TEAL'C
And I will remain here to do battle with you until the Goa'uld are
driven from this land.
[There is whispering among them.]
O'NEILL
Of course, we have to know what we're up against first. You willing
to help us on that one?
OLAF
I know a way around the patrols. I'll take you.
O'NEILL
Good.
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[Olaf ducks behind a tree. He turns to O'Neill and Teal'c and signals
them to follow. He takes off and Teal'c and O'Neill follow him.]
INT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[Food cooks in a kettle hanging above a fire pit. Carter is laying out
Goa'uld implements which she brought with her.]
GAIRWYN
If Olaf is right and Thor has rejected us, our last hope lies with
you.
DANIEL
Gairwyn...I doubt Thor's angry. He may just be far away. That's why
he left the Hammer to protect you.
GAIRWYN
If only we could gain access to the Hall of Thor's Might. I know he
would help us.
[Daniel goes over to sit by her.]
DANIEL
Wh-What is the Hall of Thor's Might?
GAIRWYN
Oh. The ancient tales tell of a hall in which Thor placed all his
powers to help us, to defend us.
DANIEL
That may signify as some sort of Asgard weapon...or weapons.
CARTER
You think they kept weapons hidden here somewhere?
DANIEL
Where is this...Hall of Thor's Might?
EXT--CIMMERIA GOA'ULD CAMP
[Olaf, Teal'c and O'Neill sneak along through tall grass and squat
down.]
OLAF
(Pointing)
There!
[Three partially build pyramid ships are in the distance. Troops of
Jaffa are everywhere.]
O'NEILL
(To Olaf)
You wait here?
OLAF
(Nods)
All right.
[O'Neill and Teal'c move a few more yards ahead and duck down. Olaf
remains behind ducking under cover. O'Neill turns his cap backwards and
pulls out his binoculars and looks through them. In the binoculars'
site, he sees a different helmet than the ones used by Apophis'
troops.]
O'NEILL
What's with the heads?
[He hands the binoculars to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
They look like those guys who used to be with Ra back on Abydos.
[He looks through the binoculars, then hands them back.]
TEAL'C
They are Horus. They guard the family of Ra. These probably guard
the Goa'uld Heru- Ur.
O'NEILL
And he'd be Ra's what? Cousin? Uncle? What?
TEAL'C
He is the son of Ra...and of Hathor.
O'NEILL
Nice pedigree.
TEAL'C
He is a very powerful System Lord. Much feared, even among Goa'uld.
He is a conqueror. He eliminates all who dare tread in his shadow.
Including other Goa'uld.
[Teal'c and O'Neill's attention are drawn to the right to a group of
Horus guards holding a struggling Olaf in their grip. Among the armored
Jaffa, one in golden armor with his helmet raised and covering his
face, appears before the man.]
HERU'UR
Kneel before your god!
OLAF
(Defiant)
God is Thor! He taught us to stand as equals! Agh!
[Olaf watches as Heru'ur's helmut disengages.]
HERU'UR
(distorted)
Your god cannot help you now. Only I can.
[O'Neill and Teal'c look on.]
HERU'UR
Strangers came through the device you call the portal. Who are they?
[One of the Jaffa grab Olaf around the neck.]
OLAF
Unh!
HERU'UR
Answer! Answer. Answer!
[O'Neill and Teal'c aim their weapons.]
OLAF
(Still in the grip of the Jaffa)
Thor taught us to have...no fear of death!
[Heru'ur walks closer and smirkes malevolently.]
HERU'UR
But did he teach you of pain?
[Heru'ur raises up his ribbon-device-clad had and it powers up, sending
its energy into Olaf.]
OLAF
No! Aaargh!
[O'Neill and Teal'c fire a volley of gunfire into the crowd of Jaffa,
killing the one holding Olaf. The Jaffa are startled. Heru'ur turns on
his personal shield as some of his Jaffa fall around him. Teal'c and
O'Neill run in and grab Olaf from them and pull him away as Heru'ur
looks on. They take off, but not before Teal'c stops and sees that
Heru'ur is reaching for a staff weapon. Teal'c raises his own and fires
it at the weapon within Heru'ur's reach. The Horus god glares at him,
his eyes glow, as Teal'c stares him down. Then Teal'c turns and follows
O'Neill and Olaf as they head up a hill. Heru'ur stands there glowering
after the three escapees as his Jaffa gather around him.]
HERU'UR
Place heavy guard at the Chaapa-ai! Find them!
[His Jaffa move away.]
INT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[Olaf leads O'Neill and Teal'c into the cave. Daniel sees them come in
and goes over to them.]
DANIEL
What happened? Did you run into Apophis?
O'NEILL
Not exactly.
TEAL'C
It was the Goa'uld called Heru-Ur.
DANIEL
You're kidding!
O'NEILL
Friend of yours?
DANIEL
Horus, the Elder, ancient Egyptian god. Pretty mean one, I mean,
especially considering his parents were Ra and Hathor--
O'NEILL
We know.
CARTER
So, did you find anything we can use?
O'NEILL
Well, the good news is, with enough artillery, we could blow those
pyramids to high hell.
DANIEL
And the bad news is?
TEAL'C
The Stargate is now heavily guarded. The Goa'uld are aware of our
existence here.
CARTER
Which means we can't evacuate the Cimmerians.
DANIEL
Well, I guess we'll just have to hold up in here awhile till things
calm down.
TEAL'C
Things will not calm down, Daniel Jackson. They will, in fact, calm
up.
[O'Neill looks at Teal'c for a moment.]
O'NEILL
He means things will escalate, of course.
TEAL'C
The new pyramids in the valley are landing pedestals for the Goa'uld
mother ships. They will most likely arrive very soon and contain
large numbers of death gliders.
O'NEILL
I'm afraid we're on our own, kids.
CARTER
I-If we can use C-4 to blow up a Goa'uld ship, couldn't we use it to
blow up the camp?
O'NEILL
Well, it's a small practical problem. If we use all the C-4 to blow
the camps now, what do we use when the ships and gliders show up
later?
DANIEL
Guys, there's a-a...there's a third option here we might want to
consider. There's a legend around here about a Hall of Thor's Might.
O'NEILL
Daniel...there's a time and place for mythology.
CARTER
With all due respect, sir, we thought Thor's Hammer was a myth until
we proved it was real.
DANIEL
Jack, I think Thor's Might may refer to...uh...an alien weapon or
weapons that have been hidden away for centuries.
CARTER
We could certainly use the firepower, sir.
DANIEL
And Gairwyn said she'd take us there.
O'NEILL
Well, much as I hate to admit it, it sounds like our old buddy Thor
is our best bet. Why don't you two try to find
this...weapon...whatever it is. Teal'c and I will lay some
explosives, see if we can slow the attack.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
[Carter and Daniel move away.]
O'NEILL
Olaf?
[Olaf joins O'Neill and Teal'c as they get up and move.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST--HALL OF MIGHT MONUMENT
[A tall Norse monument similar to Thor's Hammer stands in the forest. A
red, jewel-like stone decorates the center of a ring near the top.
Gairwyn moves around to the front of it with Daniel and Carter not far
behind.]
GAIRWYN
This is it.
[Daniel looks at it for a moment, then looks at Gairwyn.]
DANIEL
This is the Hall of Might?
GAIRWYN
You were expecting something different?
DANIEL
Well...uh...maybe a hall?
CARTER
I don't see anything that could be a weapon.
GAIRWYN
I'm sure this is it.
DANIEL
Well, maybe this will send us somewhere else. Like the obelisk sent
Jack and Teal'c to Thor's Hammer.
[Carter shrugs and Daniel turns and moves closer to the monument,
raising his hand.]
GAIRWYN
It is forbidden to touch the stone.
[Daniel hesitantly reaches up and touches the stone which lights up. A
second later a bright light shines out from the stone and envelops
them.]
INT--HALL OF THOR'S MIGHT
[Carter, Daniel, and Gairwyn are suddenly cast in darkness.]
CARTER
Daniel?
DANIEL
Wow! What a ride!
CARTER
Where are we?
[Daniel flips on his flashlight, but it's aimed at his eyes.]
DANIEL
(Wincing)
Oww!
[Carter turn on her flashlight, and they all look around.]
DANIEL
Well, this is a step in the right direction. At least it fits the
definition of the word "hall".
[They all look around.]
CARTER
I have a really bad feeling about this.
DANIEL
I don't understand. No inscriptions, no alien devices, and no
visible way out.
CARTER
Wait.
[Carter shines her flashlight over to a monument against the wall. It
is similar to the one where they were a moment ago. Suddenly, the stone
in the center begins to glow red and then a light appears above the
monument shining down. The area shimmers for a second, then an image of
a Viking in full dress and helmet appears before them.]
THOR
I am Thor. You are brave to come before me.
[Carter and Daniel are flabbergasted. Daniel is scratching his head.]
GAIRWYN
O mighty Thor, we need your help.
THOR
However, only the worthy may witness Thor's might.
GAIRWYN
Do you not think me worthy?
[The image of Thor disappears.]
GAIRWYN
Why has he forsaken me?
CARTER
It's just a holographic recording. It's being projected through that
hole in the ceiling.
DANIEL
(Not convinced)
Oh, yeah, if you say so.
CARTER
So...what does it mean?
DANIEL
I'm not sure. Maybe somehow we have to prove that we're worthy
before he'll trust us with his might.
CARTER
Which you still think is a weapon.
DANIEL
I'm hoping so, at this point.
GAIRWYN
How can we prove our worth?
DANIEL
Well, as the rest of the room is empty, I assume it has something to
do with this stone.
[The room begins to shake around them.]
GAIRWYN
(Alarmed)
Thor is preparing to strike us down!
DANIEL
No, he's not! He's--He's not a wrathful god.
CARTER
Then what is he doing?
[Dust flies and the shaking continues, then suddenly most of the floor
crumbles into a large pit leaving a very narrow beam as a pathway to
the monument. They stare at the open pit before them.]
DANIEL
Oh, this is...this is definitely a test.
[Both of them shine their flashlights down into the pit then across to
the monument.]
CARTER
So, uh...we're supposed to go across this?
DANIEL
Yeah...I don't suppose this is the best time to bring up my problem
with heights.
[Carter and Gairwyn turn to look at Daniel, who takes a deep breath.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[O'Neill, Teal'c, and Olaf are making their way through the forest. The
two members of SG-1 are planting and arming explosives into the ground
while Olaf looks on curiously.]
INT--HALL OF THOR'S MIGHT
[Carter, Daniel, and Gairwyn are still gaping at the monument.]
CARTER
Yeah, well, uh...we had to cross something way worse than this in
basic training.
DANIEL
Well, please, be my...be my guest.
CARTER
Of course, we had a net. OK. Come on. Come on...
[Raising her arms to balance herself, Carter begins to very carefully
walk along the narrow pathway. Daniel is shining his flashlight along
the path for her. Cautiously, Carter makes it to the other side and
stands by the monument. Daniel lets out the breath he's been holding.]
CARTER
Okay. Come on.
[Nervously, Gairwyn swallows, then edges out onto the beam. Carter
silently mouths encouragement just before the Cimmerian nearly
stumbles. Halfway across, the ground shakes again and Gairwyn falls
down on the beam.]
GAIRWYN
Oh!
[Carter squats down and reaches out to her.]
CARTER
Gairwyn!
[Gairwyn sobs in fear clinging to the beam.]
CARTER
Just...Just slide across. You can do it.
GAIRWYN
Thor shook the beam! He wants me dead!
DANIEL
No, he doesn't!
CARTER
It's OK. Just stay there. I'll come and get you.
DANIEL
No. I'll do it. You're already across.
[Taking a deep breath, Daniel steels himself and goes to the edge of
the beam and gingerly steps out onto it. Gairwyn whimpers.]
DANIEL
(Reassuringly)
I'm right behind you now. Almost there.
[Daniel squats down behind her as she sobs.]
DANIEL
OK...What we're going to do here, you're going to give me your hand.
I'm going to help you get back on track. And then we're going to
finish this thing together. OK?
[Gairwyn nods nervously, then moves her arm to raise herself up. A
piece of the beam crumbles from under her hands and she loses her
balance.]
GAIRWYN
Argh!
[She tumbles over the side along with Daniel as Carter looks on
horrified. Carter shines her light on the pit, and as the camera pans
back, we see solid floor again and Daniel and Gairwyn are safely
raising themselves up. Carter is incredulous.]
CARTER
Are you guys OK? OK. So...uh...what was that all about?
[A light bursts forth and shines on a figure of Thor the Viking
standing before the monument. Daniel and Gairwyn rise to their feet,
and all three look at the image.]
THOR
You have shown true selflessness and bravery. Willingness to
sacrifice oneself to save another is an honourable trait. I salute
you. Now you must add wisdom to courage. Solve the riddle of the
runes, and I will show you my true might.
[Thor then disappears again. The three approach the monument slowly,
Carter and Daniel both have their flashlights on it.]
DANIEL
How did he know what we did?
CARTER
There must be some sort of advanced sensors in here. So, uh...now
what?
[Another bright light burst forth from the monument. They are now in
another room. In the center of the room a fire burns in a kettle like
pit. Each of the walls have various symbols on them.]
DANIEL
(Shrugs)
Now we try to solve the riddle of the runes.
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[O'Neill is setting more claymore mines along their route. He covers it
with branches and looks over to Teal'c who nods his head, placing
another mine in the ground. Olaf in perched high in a tree on lookout.
In the near distance, he spies Jaffa in the woods heading their way.
Climbing down out of the tree, he rushes over to where the Colonel and
Teal'c are.]
OLAF
Sons of Midgardr! The Etins approach! A large contingent coming up
the lower path.
[O'Neill and Teal'c run past him away from the Jaffa, and Olaf is
disturbed that they're running. He raises his axe.]
OLAF
We must fight!
[O'Neill grabs Olaf by the arm and pulls him away.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[He pushes the Cimmerian to the ground behind the safety of cover,
O'Neill pulls out the remote detonating devices for the claymores.]
OLAF
You said you would help us fight.
TEAL'C
Quiet.
[Jaffa come up the path and O'Neill triggers a mine, blowing up one of
the Jaffa. Another explosion and a few more are dispensed with. Two
more explosions and the Jaffa are dead or injured on the path. O'Neill
and Teal'c leave their cover and move toward where the Jaffa were as
Olaf looks on. O'Neill and Teal'c run over and position themselves,
taking aim at more advancing Jaffa. O'Neill fires his P-90 while Teal'c
uses his staff weapon. They continue to shoot until all Jaffa are
killed. O'Neill and Teal'c cautiously look out upon the dead Jaffa,
threat assessing. Olaf comes out from behind the cover of trees.]
OLAF
Thunder! And fire! You do possess Thor's might.
[Suddenly, Olaf tosses his axe.]
OLAF
Hyaaaaaa!
[Behind Teal'c and O'Neill stands a Jaffa aiming his staff weapon at
them. The axe catches the Jaffa in the shoulder and he falls. Olaf
comes to stand beside the other two, he smiles and pats O'Neill on the
shoulder.]
OLAF
Now we are matched.
O'NEILL
Thanks.
[A Jaffa alarm is heard in the distance.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill, another patrol approaches. We should leave this area
immediately.
OLAF
Come.
[They turn and follow Olaf.]
INT--HALL OF THOR'S MIGHT
[Daniel blows some dust out of the engravings along one of the walls.
He walks along it trying to figure it out.]
CARTER
Daniel, we don't have time for this.
DANIEL
Well, the faster we solve the riddles, the faster we get whatever
Thor's might is.
CARTER
Riddles. OK.
GAIRWYN
Is Thor testing us?
DANIEL
I figure it's some sort of safeguard. He wants to be sure that
whoever finds the weapons is smart enough to understand the
technology and use it wisely. It's like he wants to be sure his
children have grown up enough before he uh...hands 'em the keys to
the armoury, which might not have been a bad idea if we'd done the
same thing on Earth.
[Daniel looks at another wall that contains geometric shapes.]
CARTER
Well, it doesn't make sense that he would waste time when the
planet's under attack.
DANIEL
Well, remember, he thinks this is a protected planet. That his
anti-Goa'uld devices are infallible. I mean, he couldn't know
there'd be any hurry to find whatever Thor's might is.
CARTER
Well, there is a hurry. Can--Can you solve this?
DANIEL
(Sighing audibly)
Uh...OK. Um...They aren't letters or words. Originally, runes were
ideographic.
CARTER
So each rune stands for an idea.
DANIEL
Right. The first one relates to Thor's protective power.
CARTER
That could mean anything. It could be the Goa'uld detector they put
up at the Gate or even the hammer device.
DANIEL
[Walking along the wall.] Uh...This last one represents a wagon, but
it was also called Thor's Chariot. Now, that could be a...spaceship.
CARTER
Great. What about the middle two?
DANIEL
[Turning back along the same wall.] Um...One is a dice cup, or Fate.
The other is a horse or...movement.
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST
[O'Neill and Teal'c continue to make their way hurriedly through the
forest. The Jaffa warning horn sounds in the distance.]
O'NEILL
What's going on, Teal'c?
TEAL'C
They are signalling their position. They will close into an
interlaced pattern that will sweep in and corner us. It is an old
Jaffa hunting technique.
O'NEILL
(Quietly)
Come on, Daniel.
[They continue through the forest.]
INT--HALL OF THOR'S MIGHT
[Daniel walks up to the wall with the engraved geometric shapes and
gazes at it.]
DANIEL
I've never seen simple geometric shapes in any runes. I have no idea
what these are about.
CARTER
Well, if we don't come up with an answer soon, we'll have to find a
way out. The colonel will need our help.
[Gairwyn is looking at a wall painted with Norse symbols and other
pictographs.]
GAIRWYN
Daniel...could the answer be here?
[He and Carter come over to look.]
DANIEL
No. Those aren't runes. They're pictographs.
(sighs)
OK. One wall has runes. One has pictographs. And one has simple
geometric shapes.
[Daniel turns to look at all of the walls.]
DANIEL
I have no idea what he wants us to do.
[Behind them, the image of Thor the Viking appears again. They turn to
look at him.]
THOR
There is no shame. Perhaps in more time you will have come of age.
DANIEL
(Stepping up)
Uh...excuse me.
(Holding up a finger)
Could you, uh...Could you uh...please just...one second?
[The image freezes before them and Daniel takes that as his cue to
continue. He turns away from Thor and back to the runes.]
DANIEL
OK. Norse runes were ideas, but in later years they, became letters.
But they were also numbers. Three...fourteen...fifteen...nine. It's
no use. It-It doesn't mean anything.
CARTER
Yes, it does.
[Daniel turns to look at her.]
CARTER
3.141 59. It's pi!
DANIEL
It's pi?
CARTER
Pi!
DANIEL
(To Thor)
It's pi? It-Is--That's what you wanted us to figure out?
(Back to Carter)
Right. "Pi" is an Earth term. We have to depict it somehow.
(The thought comes to him)
On the geometric shapes.
[He walks over to the wall with the geometric shapes. Carter follows
him.]
CARTER
This has to be it.
DANIEL
(Feeling the circle)
The inside of the circle is soft like sand.
CARTER
Pi is used to find the circumference of a circle by measuring the
radius.
DANIEL
The radius.
[Daniel draws a line with his finger from the center of the circle to
the bottom. Momentarily the sand falls away from the circle, leaving a
round red stone with the gold symbol of the hammer on it.]
DANIEL
That's it?
[Daniel reaches up and pushes the stone. A light beam out from behind
them, and they turn to the monument. The image of Thor begins to waver,
then disappear. In its place, a small, grey alien with large black eyes
stands by the monument. Carter, Daniel and Gairwyn look on
incredulous.]
DANIEL
Oh, my God.
THOR
I am the actual one...whom you know as Thor.
[The three humans are stunned.]
INT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[Olaf leads O'Neill into the cave.]
O'NEILL
(Calmly)
Olaf, get your people as far back into the cave as possible. Keep
them quiet! Put the fires out.
(To Teal'c who's just entered the cave)
How are we doing?
TEAL'C
We have been located, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(Sighs, then quietly)
Come on, Daniel.
INT--HALL OF THOR'S MIGHT
[The three are still gazing upon Thor.]
CARTER
Daniel, this is uncanny. It looks just like the descriptions of the
Roswell Greys back home.
DANIEL
(Smiling)
I guess there's some truth to those stories after all.
CARTER
You think the Asgards may have visited Earth?
DANIEL
(Wonderingly)
Why not?
THOR
I am the supreme commander of the Asgard fleet.
GAIRWYN
How can this be?
THOR
In the ten-span since I created this world you, are the first to
reach this level of contact. You've finally grown wise enough to see
me in my true form.
GAIRWYN
(To Thor and indicating Carter and Daniel)
These are the wise ones. I would never have come this far without
their help.
CARTER
Gairwyn, it's a hologram. It was probably recorded a thousand years
ago. It can't hear you.
THOR
On the contrary. My image is a living transmission. I am
communicating to you from my quarters aboard the Asgard ship
Biliskner.
DANIEL
You mean, you're the real...Thor?
[Thor blinks at them, and Daniel looks back at Carter for a moment, the
back to Thor.]
DANIEL
This is--This is...This is great. Um...We need your help. The
Goa'uld are--are here.
THOR
Impossible. Cimmeria is a safe world.
DANIEL
Yeah. We sorta messed that up.
CARTER
Oh, Daniel...Careful.
DANIEL
Look, if we want them to be our friends, we have to show them they
can trust us.
(To Thor)
You--You see, we came here about a year ago to meet you and your
people to make an alliance against the Goa'uld. One of our party, a
Jaffa, was trapped in your labyrinth.
THOR
The Jaffa serve the Goa'uld.
GAIRWYN
This one does not. He stands with them, and now with us, to fight
the Etins.
DANIEL
You see, so we had no choice but to destroy the hammer to free our
friend.
THOR
And by doing so, you have opened Cimmeria to attack by the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Yeah, apparently.
CARTER
So, uh...if you have any weapons that might be of help, we would
like to set things straight.
THOR
Weapons?
DANIEL
Isn't that what all those tests were here to protect?
THOR
The tests were designed to tell us when the Cimmerians would be
advanced enough to see us as we really are. We did not anticipate
outside interference.
DANIEL
Well, you see, we didn't mean to interfere.
[The image of Thor sparkles and he disappears. Daniel steps forward,
alarmed.]
DANIEL
No, wait!
[A bright light engulfs Carter, Daniel and Gairwyn.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN FOREST--HALL OF MIGHT MONUMENT
[Daniel and Carter materialize from the bright light.]
DANIEL
(Looking around)
Where's Gairwyn?
CARTER
Good question.
[They walk away from the monument.]
INT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[Cimmerians are huddled around in the caves. Olaf stands and goes over
to pick up his axe. He walks over to O'Neill who is seated, looking
over his weapon. Teal'c is at the entrance and comes to attention as he
spots something outside. O'Neill rises from his seat. A second later,
Daniel and Carter enter the cave.]
O'NEILL
(Going over to them)
That's timing for you. The party's about to begin.
CARTER
They're getting pretty close, how many are out there?
TEAL'C
We are outnumbered approximately twenty to one.
O'NEILL
Daniel, you look suspiciously empty-handed.
DANIEL
(Rolling his eyes and wincing)
Yrrr...yeah.
O'NEILL
"Y-y-yeah" what?
DANIEL
There's nothing, Jack.
O'NEILL
Nothing?
CARTER
Well, we did meet the real Thor.
O'NEILL
(Sarcastic)
Did you, now?
(To Daniel)
Nice fella?
[A loud squeal is heard and then, an explosion. The Cimmerians gasps in
fright.]
O'NEILL
All right. Here we go.
[SG-1 leave the cave.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN CAVE
[At the cave's entrance, the team take cover behind the rocks and
shrubs there. A line of Jaffa are taking up their weapons and preparing
to fire one of their cannons upon them.]
TEAL'C
Shield yourselves!
[They all duck, as a burst from the cannon blasts a tree apart behind
them. Cimmerian men have exited the cave behind SG-1. A Horus Warrior
steps forward.]
HORUS WARRIOR
Intruders from the Chaapa-ai! Throw down your weapons!
[The Cimmerians draw their weapons.]
HORUS WARRIOR
Surrender now, and the slaves of this world will be allowed to live
and serve Heru-Ur! Fight, and they will all die!
CARTER
Colonel, we don't have enough weapons to go around.
TEAL'C
They will all be killed, O'Neill. Women and children included.
DANIEL
(To O'Neill)
If we are responsible for this invasion, we can't allow that to
happen.
[O'Neill turns and sees a small child clinging to her father's leg.
O'Neill looks upon the Jaffa who are preparing to fire. Then he lifts
his weapon and taps the barrel on the stone before him. Raising the gun
the air in surrender and standing, Carter and Daniel follow suit.
Teal'c reluctantly puts down his staff weapon finally. The Horus
Warrior signals his men to stand down.]
O'NEILL
(To Olaf who is standing behind him)
Take care of your people.
[Olaf solemnly shakes O'Neill's hand and nods.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN ROAD
[SG-1 and their armed Jaffa escort are walking towards the Goa'uld
encampment. The Jaffa behind them have their weapons pointed at their
backs.]
DANIEL
Before they rode into battle, the Sioux used to say, "This is a good
day to die."
[O'Neill backhands Daniel lightly on the arm, as a rumbling like
thunder is heard in the distance. The team and the Jaffa stop walking
and look up at the clear, blue sky. Looking around for the source of
the continued thunder, they remain stopped. The Jaffa guarding them
seem nervous.]
DANIEL
Then again, maybe not.
[Still puzzling at the source of the noise, O'Neill is facing
backwards. Daniel, staring up at something in the sky, reaches back
blindly and pats O'Neill on his back to get his attention. O'Neill
turns around and looks at what they're seeing. Above the nearly
completed pyramids, an ominous black cloud roils and churns.]
O'NEILL
(Pulling off his sunglasses slowly)
Oh, my!
[The cloud continues to form and a large spaceship can be seen
descending from within the cloud.]
DANIEL
Ladies and gentlemen, I think this is...Thor's chariot.
TEAL'C
An Asgard mothership.
[The Jaffa behind are very nervous.]
TEAL'C
I've heard them described in Jaffa legend.
[The Jaffa point their weapons to the ship in the sky. Suddenly, a
continuous screech can be heard and a bright light consumes the Jaffa
that were escorting SG-1. O'Neill and company turn to see the light
beaming out of the Asgard mothership and cause all the Jaffa in their
encampment to disappear. The light is also consuming the three pyramids
on the ground.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN STARGATE
[Heru'ur is climbing the steps to the activated Stargate. He stops
momentarily and watches as the last pyramid disappears, then he walks
through the Gate.]
EXT--CIMMERIAN ROAD
[SG-1 are now alone on the road. The Jaffa are gone. The destruction of
the pyramids is complete and the encampment is empty. Behind the team,
a light shines down and deposits Gairwyn on the road. Smiling, she
walks up easily to the team.]
GAIRWYN
The Etins are gone. Thor sends his thanks. It was your help that
made this possible.
DANIEL
Well, to be honest with you, I think we got kinda lucky.
GAIRWYN
He told me to give you a message to satisfy your curiosity. I'm to
tell you he's a member of a species who have visited your world
often. They are a friend to all, protector of all, except the
Goa'uld, with whom they are at war.
O'NEILL
Well, that's very nice. But I'd still like to meet the old guy.
GAIRWYN
Well, he said that, like us, you're still much too young.
[SG-1 smile, knowingly.]
GAIRWYN
For us, there is still much to rebuild. Thor has promised to leave
an Asgard teacher behind to help us.
TEAL'C
Then Cimmeria will be a safe world again. That is good.
GAIRWYN
Yes, it is. I'm to tell you that Thor's new Hammer will make an
exception for the one called Teal'c. You are welcome here anytime.
[Their attention is drawn once again to the Asgard mothership in the
sky.]
