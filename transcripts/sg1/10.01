There are no other ships around them.]
INT--VALA AND TOMIN'S QUARTERS, ORI WARSHIP
[Aided by midwives, Vala is giving birth.]
NURSEMAID
Listen now, keep pushing!
VALA
I am pushing, you... Oh...
[She pushes very hard for a few moments. A baby's cry is heard. The
nursemaid swaddles the baby in a dark cloth as Vala starts laughing in
joy. Tomin kneels beside her bed as they watch the nursemaid.]
VALA
Is it all right?
NURSEMAID
She's beautiful.
VALA
(smiling, laughing as she breathes hard)
She? She.
[Tomin gets up and goes to the nursemaid, looks at the baby and smiles.
Then the nursemaid and other women in the room, Tomin in tow, start to
leave the room.]
VALA
(smiling but confused)
Wait, wait, where are you going? I want to see!
[The nursemaid looks back at her but begins to go through the opening
doors. Suddenly a Prior appears at the door, holding a staff. Tomin and
the others bow to him.]
PRIOR
(walking into the room)
Calium videre eessit, et eraos ad sidera tollere vultus.
When you see her, you see the sky, and those on earth must lift
their faces toward the stars.
[The Prior steps up close to Vala's bed as the women leave with the
baby. Tomin stays behind, near the door.]
VALA
(laughing nervously)
No, I... Can I hold her? She's my baby! After all I've just been
through, I want to hold her!
PRIOR
She belongs to all who follow the Path. Ex uno disce omnes.
VALA
What is it, Tomin?
TOMIN
From one, all will learn.
[He sits as if in shock.]
TOMIN
She is Orici.
PRIOR
Such is her purpose. In this vast expanse, that is sheltered by evil
and led astray, she will be the beacon of light in the darkness, to
the warriors of the Ori, and to all who follow the true Path to
salvation. With the wisdom of the ages, she will lead us to glorious
victory over any and all unbelievers.
[Vala appears shocked at this. Tomin looks at her with near pity, then
smiles at her.]

or other signs of life visible. Near the now-dormant Supergate, Carter
floats along in her space suit. She is trying to reach someone on her
intercom.]
CARTER
(into radio)
This is Lieutenant Colonel Carter, come in please? Can anyone hear
me? Please respond.

outward.]
CARTER
If anyone can hear me, this is Lieutenant Colonel Carter. Please
respond.

yelling. He runs and climbs into the cockpit of an F-302, straps
himself in, and powers it up. As the hangar explodes around him, he
flies the ship out and away.]
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
[Two large Ori blasts hit the Korolev, and it explodes in a huge

that you?
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
MITCHELL
Yes, sir.
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
CARTER
Thank God. This is Carter. Are you in range to beam me back aboard?
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Emerson is in the command chair, Marks at his station beside him.]
EMERSON
I'm afraid that we haven't got beaming capability at this time.
Kvasir's working on it.
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
CARTER
Where were you?
[The Odyssey moves in toward the Supergate.]
EMERSON
I'm sorry we were out of touch there for a while. We lost all
communications in the battle.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
EMERSON
We got our sub-light back on line and then tracked the Ori safely
from a distance using our long-range sensors, til they jumped into
hyperspace about an hour ago. We're still just getting back our
basic operating systems.
CARTER
Look, uh, I hate to be self-centered here, especially given what's
just happened, but uh, I've only got a couple of hours of life
support left here.
EMERSON
(via radio)
I'm aware of your situation, Colonel. I'll keep you apprised.

Receiving hail.
EMERSON
On screen.
[He stands and moves to the viewscreen, which activates, showing Teal'c
aboard a Lucian Alliance Goa'uld mothership.]
TEAL'C
Colonel Emerson.
EMERSON
Teal'c. It's good to see you okay.
TEAL'C
You as well. This vessel has sustained substantial damage. It has
taken some time to get primary systems back on line.
EMERSON
We've been receiving several distress beacons from damaged ships.
We've been able to ring aboard a few survivors, but our life
support's already taxed. Any chance you could take on a few people?
[On the viewscreen, the area behind Teal'c erupts in zat blast fire.
Teal'c turns and fires back, then the screen goes blank. Emerson looks
on.]
EMERSON
I'll take that as a 'no'.
(to Marks)
How are the shields and hyperdrive coming?
MARKS
(consulting console)
We have twenty percent power to shields. Kvasir is concentrating on
the Asgard beam technology. Hyperdrive is still off-line.
EMERSON
How about some good news. Anything?
MARKS
(nervously)
Colonel Mitchell has landed safely.
EMERSON
Thank you.
(starts to leave the bridge)
Keep a channel open to that mothership. Try to reach Teal'c.

longer bloody.]
EMERSON
Why would the first wave just leave us behind? They had to know
there were survivors.
MITCHELL
They need witnesses. Their goal is not to kill us all, it's to
convert us. They wish us to go forth and tell everybody about how
they kicked our asses.
EMERSON
That they did.

Kvasir, this is Emerson. Please report.

He's working as fast as he can.
MITCHELL
Any of the Korolev crew beam over before the ship was lost?
EMERSON
A half dozen. Not Doctor Jackson. We located the data recorder, and
we're working on retrieving it.
MITCHELL
Word from Teal'c?
EMERSON
Uh, briefly, but then we lost the signal. He seems to be in a bit of
a scuffle over control of the ship.

sir. They're asking to speak with you.
INT--CORRIDOR OF THE ODYSSEY
EMERSON
(into comm)
I'm on my way.
MITCHELL
Is Earth aware of our situation?
EMERSON
Our only long-range array that wasn't fried was sensors. Sub-space
communication is beyond repair. Still, they gotta know something's
wrong. We've missed two scheduled check-ins.
MITCHELL
(rubbing his eyes in exhaustion)
So, there's no help.
EMERSON
No, unfortunately there's nothing they can do. The Korolev and the
Odyssey are our only two ships in the galaxy.
MITCHELL
How long can we go on current life support?
EMERSON
A day, maybe less, and that's only if we don't take on more
survivors.
[Mitchell nods in concern and discouragement.]
MITCHELL
(sarcastically)
Great.
EMERSON
Yeah.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Mitchell and Emerson enter.]
MARKS
The channel is open, sir.
EMERSON
This is Colonel Emerson of the Earth ship Odyssey.
[Netan and another man are on the view screen.]
NETAN
I am Netan, leader of the Lucian Alliance. You should surrender your
ship to our control immediately.
[Emerson is surprised.]
MITCHELL
Do you want me to take this one, sir?
EMERSON
Go ahead.
[Mitchell steps forward to speak to the viewscreen.]
MITCHELL
Hey there. Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell here. Look, we were
all in this fight together, weren't we? This is not how allies are
supposed to treat each other. Granted, we got our butts kicked, but
we still need each other if we're gonna survive.
NETAN
Our sensors detect your shield's at minimum. If you do not
capitulate immediately, we will open fire.
EMERSON
You'd be destroying the only other ship out here with life support
capabilities.
NETAN
(hissing in anger)
You dragged us into this battle knowing it would deplete our forces.
I suspect intentionally.
MITCHELL
That's not true. We all lost. Badly. Why don't you tell us your
situation? Maybe we can work something out.
NETAN
The situation is, you will surrender or be destroyed.
[Mitchell gives him a hard stare, then turns to talk quietly to
Emerson.]
MITCHELL
What sort of ordnance do we have on board?
EMERSON
Not much, and he's right about our shields. We're sitting ducks.

shivering. The door opens, and Tomin strides in.]
TOMIN
How are you feeling?
[She sits up but is in obvious pain.]
VALA
Look, they can't keep her from me. No matter who or what she is, I'm
her mother. She needs to be fed and cared for, doesn't she?
[They speak over each other, each trying to make their points.]
TOMIN
She's being well cared for.
VALA
I should be allowed to see her.
TOMIN
I spoke with the Prior.
VALA
And?
TOMIN
They've agreed to let you see her.
[The door slides open. Tomin drops to the floor in prostration. A
serving maid enters, holding the hand of a little girl appearing about
four years old. She wears a bonnet and a red cape and is smiling. Vala
looks at her in shock and confusion.]
ADRIA
Hello, Mother.
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
[Odyssey hovers opposite the Lucian mothership, which shows clear signs
of damage.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Odyssey, this is Carter. I don't know what you can see from your
vantage point or what your sensors are picking up, but from out
here, that mothership looks pretty badly damaged. I'd be surprised
if they were weapons capable.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
EMERSON

Thanks, Sam.
MITCHELL
They haven't fired yet.
EMERSON

VALA
Well, I heard that children grow up quickly, but this is ridiculous!
(feeling a pain in her abdomen)
Ah.
[Adria walks over to Vala and places her hand on Vala's stomach. After
a moment, the girl nods at Vala as if she has finished.]
VALA
(disturbed)
Well. That feels much better. Thank you.
ADRIA
You do not believe.
VALA
(challenging, but surprised)
I don't know what you mean.
ADRIA
(sweetly)
You cannot hide your feeling from me. It's all right. I will help
you find the Path. Hallowed are the Ori.
TOMIN

Hallowed are the Ori.

Adria, who is smiling.]

Bra'tac comes through and strides down the ramp, dressed in battle
attire.]
LANDRY
Bra'tac, what do you know?
BRA'TAC
The battle did not go well.
LANDRY
We've lost all contact with both Earth ships.
BRA'TAC
We would be lucky if either survived. Word is four Ori ships came
through the Chappa'ko.
LANDRY
Supergate.
BRA'TAC
They lay waste to all that stood in their path, and then moved on.
LANDRY
We need to get at least one ship out to the scene of that battle,
find out exactly what happened and if there's anybody left who needs
help.
BRA'TAC
Agreed.

EMERSON
Hmm, what is that?

It was supposed to be...a sandwich.

MITCHELL
Can you fix it in time?
KVASIR
I am unsure of where the instability is occurring.
MITCHELL
(gesturing with a finger)
Simple answer!
KVASIR
I will have to go through the program code again, line by line.
MITCHELL
That's a no.
(turning to Emerson)
It's time for Plan B.

Uh, if you're thinking what I think you're thinking, it won't work.

[Teal'c lies on the floor of a cell, his hands chained together in
front of him. The cell door opens, and Netan walks in. He carries a
Goa'uld pain stick.]
NETAN
This is your fault.
TEAL'C
And I have already told you all I know of the Ori. Our only hope of
defeating their followers is to unite our forces and work together.
You have nothing to gain by torturing me.
NETAN
(intensely)
That is where you are wrong. I am very, very angry right now, and
causing you a great deal of pain will make me feel better.
[He walks toward Teal'c and activates the pain stick on him. Teal'c
begins screaming.]
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE

MITCHELL
(into radio)
I am not gonna hit you.
(to himself)
Not on purpose.

[As Carter sits motionless relative to the ship, the Odyssey moves
toward her at a rather rapid pace. She is tiny compared to ship. The
nose passes her, then the body of the ship begins to pass.]

Even if you get me in past the shield, the artificial gravity will
kick in. A fall from even thirty feet in this suit...

CARTER

Thank you.

MITCHELL
You're welcome. Yeah, I was going to say no sweat, but there was
definitely sweat involved. In Kvasir's case I think it was
perspiration.
[Carter smiles for a moment.]
CARTER
Any news on Teal'c?
MITCHELL
No. But we have something else.
[Mitchell gestures, and Marks hands Carter a portable computer.]
MARKS
We downloaded the blackbox data from the Korolev.
MITCHELL
We know that six people got off using beaming technology before it
went up. None of them was Jackson. However...

CHEKOV
How can we lock on?
DANIEL
Just set our rings to seek out the nearest other set. It's worth a
shot.
CHEKOV
Go!
DANIEL
Move closer. I'm on it!

INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Woolsey sits in a chair as Landry walks around the office.]
WOOLSEY
You don't know where the enemy ships are, or what they're capable
of?
LANDRY
All we know is they cut through two of our 304's, an Asgard ship,
and a fleet of Goa'uld motherships.
WOOLSEY
They could be on their way here as we speak.
LANDRY
(insistent)
We sent the best we had to stop them.
WOOLSEY
The IOA is considering bringing the Atlantis ZPM to Earth, for use
in the Antarctic Earth defense system.
LANDRY
Even if we had a ship, it would take a minimum of three weeks for
the ZPM to get here. And there's no guarantee the Ancient weapons
platform in Antarctica would be any more effective against the Ori
ships than what we've already thrown at them.
(leaning over his desk, into Woolsey's space)
As usual, the IOA is wasting their breath.
(stepping back, relaxing)
You know, if I had the salaries they pay those idiot blowhard
politicians to put into my budget...
(sitting at his desk)
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
[Woolsey takes a deep breath but doesn't respond. Landry chuckles.]
INT--CORRIDOR OF ORI WARSHIP
[Vala strides down the corridor in an elaborate blue dress. A guard is
stationed at a door. Hesitantly she enters, coming into an ante-room;
its walls are covered in religious murals. She takes a breath and
activates the controls on the inner door. It opens, and she enters the
room.]
INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
[The room is lit with candles, and a porthole shows the rushing blues
of hyperspace. A large book sits on a stand. Food sits on a round
wooden table with two chairs. A serving woman pours drinks from a metal
pitcher. There are more religious paintings around the room, partially
obscured by curtains.]
ADRIA
Hello, Mother. You need not be afraid.
[Adria, now about seven years old, is being dressed in a caped red
dress by two serving ladies. She wears a bonnet-style hat in fine red
fabric. Like her younger self, she has dark hair and very light brown
eyes. Vala walks toward the bedroom alcove where Adria is being
dressed.]
VALA
Are you actually going to stop growing at some point? Because, well,
at this
rate you're going to have a very short life.
[Adria smiles slightly, then nods for her serving ladies to leave her.
They do.]
ADRIA
(smiling)
I'm glad you worry for me. Are you feeling better?
VALA
I am. Thank you.
ADRIA
I am very hungry!
[She moves to sit at the table of food.]
ADRIA
Would you like something to eat?
VALA
Okay.
[Vala sits across from her. Adria takes a bit of food as Vala looks on,
still in shock.]
ADRIA
You have questions.
VALA
Do you have a name?
ADRIA
(proudly)
They call me "Orici."
VALA
Yeah. It's not much of a name, is it?
ADRIA
What would you like to call me?
VALA
Well. I always thought that if I had a daughter, that I'd name her
after my mother. She was a very...strong woman. Her name was Adria.
ADRIA
I like that. Adria.
[Vala smiles at her.]
ADRIA
(realizing)
You think that by naming me, you will humanize me. Make me more like
you. More sympathetic to your point of view.
VALA
(seemingly curious)
How do you know what you know?
ADRIA
The Ori wove their knowledge into my genetic makeup. At least, as
much as my human brain could hold. All their knowledge is far too
much for us to possibly comprehend. The understanding of an infinite
universe is obviously without boundaries.
VALA
Then you're not actually one of them?
ADRIA
I am the closest I can be, in the form of flesh and blood.
VALA
Isn't there a part of you that's from me?
ADRIA
Of course. You are my mother.
VALA
Exactly!
[Vala stands and begins walking around the table.]
VALA
(inexpertly)
And as your mother, you will listen to me, young lady. There will be
no leading of these ships and armies on a mass-murdering crusade! Or
else!
[Adria only smiles, then stares at her. Seeing the futility, Vala sits
next to Adria.]
VALA
Eh, it was worth a try.
ADRIA
I know why you believe what you do. The Ancients are the ones who
have lied to you. They are the ones who long ago tried to destroy
the Ori for their beliefs. Not the other way around. Only the Ori
share all they learn. The Ancients have kept the basic truths of
your existence from you!
[Vala stands and steps away, clearly not agreeing. Adria stands as
well.]
ADRIA
They have hoarded their knowledge and been dishonest about
everything! Contrary to what they've told you, the Ori most
certainly do ascend their followers. And the Ancients are the ones
sapping energy from humans in this galaxy, to empower themselves!
That is why they created you. To give them the strength to destroy
the Ori once and for all. That is why all those who cannot be made
to see the true Path, must be destroyed, or all will be lost...to
evil.
[Vala takes a breath and bends toward Adria.]
VALA
Are you saying this is a preemptive strike? It's self defense?
ADRIA
It matters not what you call it. The cause is just, and the truth
will see us through to victory.
VALA
Do you really believe that? Or are you just hoping I will.
ADRIA
(off-balance)
Why don't you believe me, Mother?
VALA
(standing upright)
I don't know.
ADRIA
You choose to take the word of an Ancient over your daughter. What
have the Ancients done to earn your trust?
VALA
About as much as you.
ADRIA
In the end, only you can decide the fate of your own soul.
[Vala gives Adria an assessing look.]

Two motherships just dropped out of hyperspace.

Come about. Let's face 'em head on.
MARKS
The Lucian Alliance ship is hailing us again.
NETAN

Lower your shields or prepare to be boarded, or you will be
destroyed. I assure you, Captain, I am quite capable of following
through this time.
MARKS
Shields at thirty percent. They won't stand up to much.

Not well. Kvasir's still working on the beam technology.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

Sensors indicate the motherships are powering weapons.
INT--VALA AND TOMIN'S QUARTERS, ORI WARSHIP
[Vala enters her quarters. She senses something and turns to find
Daniel waiting in the corner. He throws back the hood of a cloak he has
acquired and points his gun at her. At her shock, he signals for her to
be quiet.]
DANIEL
Long story.
VALA
Are you alone?
DANIEL
Yes. What happened to you?
VALA
(looking at his gun, pointed at her)
What do you mean?
[He looks at her belly.]
VALA
Oh! I had a baby.
[He looks incredulous. She taps him on the chest as she starts talking,
unconcerned by the gun.]
VALA
You know, I never thought I'd agree with my father, but now I'm
starting to remember about how he used to go on about 'you nurture
them, and then you raise them, and you teach them the best that you
can, and then all they do is break your hearts.' I always assumed
that his experience was just tainted by me.
DANIEL
(very confused)
What are you talking about?
VALA
Well, she started of out all sweet and innocent to begin with, and
now she's hell-bent on domination of the galaxy.
DANIEL
What? How old is she?
VALA
A few hours. The Ori used me to sneak one of their own over the
border. This child is their way of cheating the ascended rulebook.
Well they couldn't exactly encroach on our galaxy themselves without
getting into a confrontation with the Ancients, right?
[Daniel nods and grunts.]
VALA
So they created their own human representative, with their
knowledge, to lead their armies.
DANIEL
Sort of an uber-Prior, like the Doci?
VALA
Oh, but she's much worse than that! The Priors are just pawns. She
knows the score. She's complicit with the Ori. You should have heard
the propaganda that she just tried to feed me.
DANIEL
Wait, wait, wait. We're talking about a baby here, right?
VALA
Oh, she's been genetically altered. She'll be a fully grown
figurehead in a day or so.
(turning and running her hands along her body)
If she takes after her mother, she'll have a pretty good figure,
too.
DANIEL
This is bad.
VALA
You're telling me. Origin's about to become a lot more appealing to
the males of this galaxy.
DANIEL
Do you have any idea where we're going?
VALA
No. That she wouldn't tell me. She knows I'm not on her side. She's
still hoping I'll see the light. But part of her can't help but feel
tied to me. She wanted me to give her a name.
DANIEL
And?
VALA
Adria. Told her it was my mother's.
DANIEL
Not?
VALA
Stepmother. Witch of a woman.
DANIEL
You know the more I get to know you, the more I'm starting to
understand.
VALA
Huh?
DANIEL
Nothing.
VALA
Do you know what's strange, Daniel?
DANIEL
No!
VALA
She has the knowledge of Ascended Beings, twisted as it may be, but
I sense that there is a part of her that is just like any other kid,
that wants her mother's approval. So I'm hoping I can use that
somehow. I mean, why else would she care what I think, right?
DANIEL
Well, right now I'm a little more concerned about getting off this
ship. I mean, there's only so long I can hide.
VALA
Hide.
DANIEL
Yeah.
VALA
Hide!
[Daniel turns to see a shadow behind the door's window and realizes
Vala means for him to hide now. He runs forward and jumps over the bed,
rolling over the far side onto his back. Vala coughs to cover the noise
just as Tomin enters, dressed in casual work clothing.]
VALA
Ha- Hi.
TOMIN
What?
VALA
Hi. Long day?
TOMIN
(rubbing his face in exhaustion)
Uh, I'm exhausted. Uh, I see you're up and around.
[He has moved toward the bed and looks like he's going to step to the
far side. Instead Vala knocks him over the footboard and onto his back
on the bed, then jumps on top of him.]
VALA
(laughing)
Much better. Hmm.
[She leans toward him as if to kiss him.]
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
[Three motherships jump from hyperspace into normal space behind the
Odyssey, so that it is now surrounded.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

Three more ships just emerged from hyperspace.
MITCHELL
They're flanking us.
MARKS
Receiving hail.
EMERSON
On screen.
[The screen comes alive to show Bra'tac in command of one of the newly
arrived ships.]
BRA'TAC
Greetings.
MITCHELL
Bra'tac! Greetings back atcha. Head's up, the Lucian Alliance is
getting ready to open fire on us.
BRA'TAC
I have already demanded that they stand down, or face us in battle.
[Alarms sound on the bridge.]
MARKS
They're firing weapons.
EXT--SPACE NEAR SUPERGATE
[The two newly arrived motherships fire upon the damaged one that Netan
commands, quickly breaking through its shields to inflict massive
damage.]
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY

EMERSON
What the hell are they doing?
MITCHELL

Carter, now or never!

KVASIR

[Teal'c beams into the room. He is on his back, his hands still
shackled together. Carter runs to him and kneels beside him.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Bridge, we have Teal'c.
(helping Teal'c sit up)
Are you okay?
TEAL'C
I have been better.
[Teal'c's face has cuts, and he has a wound in his right shoulder.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Medical team to auxiliary control room two.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE ODYSSEY
[Out the forward viewscreen, the remaining two Lucian Alliance ships
enter hyperspace.]
EMERSON
I guess we've all had enough fighting for one day.
MITCHELL
They just didn't want us to be able to salvage their ship when they
turned tail and ran.
INT--VALA AND TOMIN'S QUARTERS, ORI WARSHIP
[Vala is lying across Tomin's lap at the foot of the bed.]
TOMIN
After everything you've been through, after everything you've seen,
how can you still not believe in the Ori?
VALA
You think I don't.
TOMIN
The Orici is a truth-seer.
VALA
She is a child. Little girls always have issues with their mothers.
[Daniel watches from his hiding spot on the floor. He has his pistol
ready.]
TOMIN
Are you saying you do believe in the Ori?
VALA
Why are you here with me if you doubt my devotion?
TOMIN
Because I love you. Because I'm still hoping I can save your soul.
[Vala looks at him worriedly, and he bends to kiss her. The lights
around the ship change and a siren sounds at a distance. Tomin lifts
Vala out of his lap and jumps off the near side of the bed.]
VALA
What? Where are you going?
TOMIN
I'm called to duty.
[He leaves. Daniel sits up.]
VALA
And here I was hoping I could save him.
INT--INFIRMARY OF THE ODYSSEY
[Carter is visiting with Teal'c, who is dressed in blue scrubs and has
a sling on his right arm. Bra'tac and Mitchell enter, and Teal'c
stands.]
BRA'TAC
(putting a hand on Teal'c's good shoulder)
I am glad to see you alive.
TEAL'C
It is good to be alive, old friend.
MITCHELL
We just got some bad news.
BRA'TAC
The Ori ships have been located. Moments ago they emerged from
hyperspace. Over Chulak.
[Teal'c is shocked by the news.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE CHULAK
[A mothership is destroyed. An Ori ship has fired, and it comes
screaming toward the planet. Other Ori ships arrive. The lead ships
release dozens of small fighter-type craft that go speeding down to the
planet.]
EXT--SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY
[The small ships fly over the treetops. They engage death gliders in
air battle.]
INT--CORRIDOR OF THE ODYSSEY
[Teal'c, Bra'tac, Emerson, Carter, and Mitchell are walking.]
EMERSON
Why Chulak?
BRA'TAC
Perhaps because it is where the Jaffa rebellion against the Goa'uld
began. No matter. We must not abandon them.
EMERSON
Well as soon as we get our hyperdrive back, we have to head to Earth
for repairs. Someone's gotta stick around and keep an eye on that
Supergate.
CARTER
We may not be able to stop the Ori ships from coming through, but we
should at least know if they do.
BRA'TAC
We will leave a small contingent in a cloaked scout ship behind.
MITCHELL
Can you expect backup?
BRA'TAC
It is unlikely. The remaining Jaffa fleet defends Dakara.
MITCHELL
You've only got three motherships. We had a lot more than that here,
and we couldn't stop them.
[They arrive at the ring control room.]
BRA'TAC
We cannot merely standby as our brothers and sisters fall.
[Bra'tac walks away and begins to program the ring controls.]
MITCHELL
Sam, I'm going with them.
CARTER
Yep, me too.
EMERSON
It's suicide.
CARTER
Well, for Teal'c and Bra'tac, that's not really an argument against
going.
EMERSON
What about you?
CARTER
However remote, there is still a chance that Daniel's alive on board
one of those Ori ships. He may need our help.
EMERSON
You really believe that?
CARTER
(smiling at Mitchell and Teal'c)
You don't know him like we do.
[She joins the others on the ring platform.]
EMERSON
Good luck.
[They ring away.]
EXT--SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY
[An Ori ship lowers itself to the surface outside a city, its fighter
escort flying nearby.]
INT--VALA AND TOMIN'S QUARTERS, ORI WARSHIP
[From an alcove, Vala watches some soldiers march down a corridor. She
closes her door and turns around.]
VALA
Looks like the ground incursion is about to begin.
[Daniel is looking out the window. It is their ship that is on the
ground.]
DANIEL
We're on Chulak.
[He steps away from the window to face Vala.]
DANIEL
With most of the warriors out there fighting Jaffa, we might be able
to get off the ship undetected.
VALA
We have an opportunity here.
DANIEL
Yes, I was thinking that, but we don't know what powers that child
might have.
VALA
She is the key to the whole invasion. If we could somehow capture
her, take her with us, turn her against the Ori, then she would
become the most powerful weapon we could have against them.
DANIEL
That's a big if.
VALA
What have you got?
DANIEL
Nothing.
VALA
Worth a try, then?
DANIEL
(noncommittal)
Eh.
VALA
You're gonna need a better disguise.
[She pats him on the chest, leads him to the door and opens it. They
exit.]
INT--CORRIDOR OF ORI WARSHIP
VALA
I know where the armory is. They have stun weapons like zat guns.
I'll distract them while you sneak up and stun them.
[As they round a corner in the corridor, Tomin enters the corridor
behind them and sees them. He appears disappointed but doesn't follow.]
EXT--HYPERSPACE
[Two Jaffa motherships travel through hyperspace.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
[Bra'tac is navigating as Teal'c and Carter look on. Mitchell steps in
from the edge of the room.]
MITCHELL
It's kind of a skeleton crew on board. How many more Jaffa do you
have on the other ships?
BRA'TAC
Not many. Getting the Council to relinquish three ha'tak was
difficult enough. The crew I had to assemble personally.
MITCHELL
So, we're outmatched in manpower, firepower, and technology. Do we
have any sort of battle strategy, or are we just planning on
dropping out of hyperspace and getting our asses kicked again.
[He notes the silence from the others, and Bra'tac's surprised look.]
MITCHELL
Hey, I'm all about noble death. Pointless noble death, on the other
hand...
CARTER
The Korolev log indicated that they were attempting to use the rings
to get a nuke through the fluctuation in the Ori ship's shields that
was coinciding with the firing of their main weapons.
MITCHELL
Great! So we'll use the other two ships to draw their fire while we
sneak around the backside and jam a big old nuke up their tailpipe.
CARTER
But we don't have any nukes.
MITCHELL
(to Bra'tac and Teal'c)
You have any fancy Jaffa bombs?
TEAL'C
We have explosives that should be effective.
CARTER
All right. As soon as we drop out of hyperspace, I'll start
broadcasting on all radio channels. If Daniel's still alive,
hopefully he'll get the message that we're here, and he can ring
aboard.
[Mitchell nods and steps toward Bra'tac.]
MITCHELL
There you go.
[He slaps Bra'tac on the shoulder, covertly attaching a small device
onto his shoulder armor.]
MITCHELL
Now we got a plan.
[Mitchell walks out. Bra'tac looks bemused.]
INT--CORRIDOR OF ORI WARSHIP
[Daniel and Vala walk down a corridor. He is now dressed in the Ori
warrior armor, which has a Japanese flavor.]
DANIEL
You know, if she's anything like the Priors, she may have powers
like them.
VALA
That's why I'll go in first, try and get her back turned toward the
door so she doesn't see you coming. Now you've learned that the
Priors need to be focused in order for their powers to work, so when
you hear the catch phrase, come in firing, and anyone else in the
room shouldn't be a problem.
DANIEL
(holding up a device on his wrist and activating it)
Are you sure this thing just stuns?
VALA
(as if by memory, not certainly)
The staff thing kills, that's less potent, but if you shoot that at
someone several times, it will probably kill.
[He gives her a dubious look then nods, and she nods back. Vala enters
Adria's rooms while Daniel turns and appears to stand guard outside.]
INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
VALA
Adria? It's me.
ADRIA
(from out of sight)
Come in, Mother.
[Vala enters to find Adria sitting on the end of her bed, in an alcove
off of the main room. She is several years older now, dressed in a
Renaissance style dress with a burgundy cape and a patterned bonnet.
The bedroom is lighted by candles and some small torch fires.]
VALA
Are you all right? Why are you sitting here alone in the dark?
[The torch fires, sitting on Ori-styled pedestals, become much larger,
illuminating the bedroom. Vala laughs nervously.]
ADRIA
The knowledge in my mind is growing as I am. It's a lot to take in.
It makes my head ache.
VALA
I can imagine... Actually, no I can't. But I'm sure it's rough.
EXT--SPACE ABOVE CHULAK
[Three ha'tak's exit hyperspace. Two immediately begin firing on the
three Ori ships in orbit around Chulak while another peels off. The Ori
ships' shields repel the weapons. Two Ori ships move away.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
[Carter and Bra'tac view a real-time diagram of the ship locations. One
Ori ship is following the two ha'tak's while the others stay behind.]
CARTER
It's chasing them.
BRA'TAC
Moving into flanking position.
INT--RING ROOM OF HA'TAK
[Mitchell sets a large spherical bomb in the center of the ring
platform and begins arming it while Teal'c waits beside the control
panel.]
EXT--SURFACE OF CHULAK, DAY
[The Ori ship sits behind the city.]
INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
[Adria is standing now as Vala looks out the window upon Chulak.]
ADRIA
What are you doing?
VALA
Looking out on Chulak.
[Adria steps up next to her at the window, her back to the door.]
VALA
Are you interested in the planet you're conquering?
ADRIA
Have you been here before?
VALA
(facing Adria)
Once. What do you know of the Jaffa?
ADRIA
They are a proud people. Confused about the ways to salvation. They
have been misled by parasites posing as gods for many generations.
But in their hearts, I believe they know ascension is the true goal
of our existence.
VALA
Then why are you slaughtering them?
[Vala stands and steps away. Adria looks angry at the question.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
CARTER
(into radio)
This is Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter calling any survivors of
the Earth ship Korolev. Please come in.
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
[Daniel stands watch at the door. His radio comes to life.]
CARTER
(via radio)
Repeat. This is Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter calling any
survivors of the Earth ship Korolev. Please come in.
[Daniel pulls the radio out from his armor suit and activates it.]
DANIEL
(quietly, into radio)
Sam, it's me, Daniel.
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
[Carter smiles at Bra'tac in relief.]
CARTER

Daniel! I knew you'd made it.
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
DANIEL

Yeah, it's good to hear you, too. Listen, I'm kinda in the middle of
something right now.
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
CARTER
(into radio)
We're in orbit, trying to blow up one of the Ori ships.
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
DANIEL
Yeah, I'm in one of the ships that's landed on the planet. I'm going
to have to tell you the rest later. Requesting radio silence.
[Two soldiers have approached him from behind. Daniel turns his radio
off and puts it away, then turns to face the corridor as they pass by
unsuspecting.]
EXT--SPACE NEAR CHULAK
[One of the Ori ships fires on and destroys one of the ha'taks.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
[Carter looks worried.]
BRA'TAC
I am detecting the fluctuation in their shields. Almost in range.
CARTER

The good news is, I just made contact with Daniel. We were right.
He's alive and on board the Ori ship that's landed on the planet.
INT--RING ROOM OF HA'TAK
MITCHELL
Hallelujah. What's the bad news?
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK

will be a very short battle.
BRA'TAC
We are in range.

[Mitchell arms the bomb and jumps off the platform. Teal'c rings it
away.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK

happened.]
CARTER
It should have gone off by now.
INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
ADRIA
(angry)
They must embrace their destiny.
[She goes to join Vala near the door.]
VALA
Well then. Hallowed are the Ori.
ADRIA
Please, Mother. It is blasphemous for an unbeliever to speak those
words.
VALA
No. Really. You're starting to make sense to me now. I'm really
coming around.
[As she speaks, her voice rises and she maneuvers so that Adria's back
is to the door.]
VALA
(smiling falsely, more loudly)
Hallowed are the Ori!
[She looks to the door for Daniel to enter. He does, but Tomin is
pushing him, armed with a staff weapon aimed at Daniel. Tomin closes
the door behind them. Daniel and Vala exchange disappointed looks.]
EXT--SPACE NEAR CHULAK
[The two ha'taks are fighting with one Ori ship. Another Ori ship comes
in at right angles vertically and takes out one of the ha'taks with one
shot.]
INT--PEL'TAK OF BRA'TAC'S HA'TAK
[Mitchell and Teal'c arrive jogging.]
CARTER
We just lost another mothership.
MITCHELL
Let's get Jackson on board and get the hell out of here.
BRA'TAC
(resolute and somber)
I am sorry, Colonel Mitchell. That is not the plan.
[On their viewscreen, they see an Ori ship turning back toward them,
Chulak looming behind it.]
MITCHELL
Bra'tac, what are you doing?
TEAL'C
I believe he intends to ram the enemy vessel.
MITCHELL
Yeah, I got that. That'll kill us.
CARTER
I think he knows that.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
MITCHELL
Teal'c, this is crazy, and not the good kind of crazy, you know
that.
TEAL'C
What would you have me do, Colonel Mitchell?
MITCHELL
(getting angry)
Talk to him.
[Teal'c sneers at Mitchell and looks back at the viewscreen.]
CARTER
Chances are we'll just impact the shield. We won't do any damage to
them.
MITCHELL
(to Bra'tac)
What do you think, you're making some kind of a statement? Hey, I
know this is your ship, we didn't have to come along, and maybe it
is better to die in battle, I don't know. I was never really hoping
to find out. But I do know one thing. There's no point in dying when
you're going to lose anyway. Not when you have a choice.
[Bra'tac has been looking at Mitchell as he speaks, but he scowls and
looks back at the viewscreen, planning to continue. Carter looks
worried and Mitchell frustrated.]
INT--ADRIA'S APARTMENT ON ORI WARSHIP
[Tomin stands behind Daniel, his staff weapon aimed at Daniel's back.]
TOMIN
They were conspiring against you!
ADRIA
Yes, I know. Kill him.
VALA
(rushing to Daniel)
No!
[She stands between Daniel and Tomin.]
VALA
Wait! We want to talk to you.
TOMIN
Move!
ADRIA
I said, kill him!
[Tomin moves to shoot Daniel. Vala moves as well, pushing Daniel out of
the way. Tomin shoots Vala in the abdomen, and she falls to the floor.
Adria and Tomin rush to her.]
ADRIA
Mother!
TOMIN
Vala?
[They turn Vala from her front onto her side. She groans in pain. Adria
begins to heal her immediately. Standing behind her, Daniel shoots both
Adria and Tomin with the stun weapon.]
VALA
(annoyed)
You couldn't have waited until she'd finished healing me?
DANIEL
Well, she was distracted.
[Daniel helps her to sit up.]
VALA
Leave me, grab her.
[He gets her standing.]
DANIEL
Oh yeah, like that's going to happen.
[Suddenly a ring of fire erupts around them. Daniel is shocked. The
door opens to reveal a Prior standing on the other side of the flames.]

stunner, which he has reacquired, but it doesn't fire. Daniel pulls his
Beretta and aims it at unconscious Adria's head.]
VALA
(to Daniel)
No!
[The Prior telekinetically pulls the gun from Daniel's hand and smiles.
He tilts his staff at them. The Asgard beam begins to activate. Sensing
it, Daniel wraps his arms around Vala. They beam out together, leaving
the Prior surprised and Adria still unconscious.]

CARTER
We were lucky the ship on the planet had lowered its shields.
VALA
You should have grabbed for Adria, not me.
DANIEL
No, I'm thinking I should have shot her when I had the chance.
CARTER
(admonishing)
Daniel, you couldn't have killed a child.
DANIEL
She's not a child. She's an Ori in the body of a human.
MITCHELL
Isn't that cheating?
CARTER
Well, Orlin broke the rules by taking human form and telling us the
truth about the Ori.
MITCHELL
Yeah, and he paid for that. No offense, but I think this kid's going
to be a big problem.
VALA
(chuckling for a moment)
Hmm. She'll be fully grown within a matter of days.
MITCHELL
See? Cheating!
DANIEL
Yeah, I gotta admit the Ascended rulebook's getting a little hard to
understand.
MITCHELL
And, I don't think there really is one.
TEAL'C
There usually never are rules in a war.
MITCHELL
Unfortunately, right now there is no war.
[The others look at him expectantly. Mitchell stands.]
MITCHELL
In a war, you've got two sides fighting. All we have is a lot of
winning by the bad guys. They have troops and ships in our
territory, and a Supergate to bring in more any time they need them.
CARTER
I remember when we first opened the gate. The Goa'uld had total
domination over the galaxy. They had massive superiority over us. A
lot of people didn't think we had a chance.
MITCHELL
I'm not saying we should give up. I'll fight to my dying breath. I
just think we need a new plan.
[Teal'c nods at him, while Daniel looks thoughtful.]
MITCHELL
A damn good one.
