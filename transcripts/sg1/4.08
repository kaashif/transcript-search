The First Ones
TEASER
EXT-P3X-888, DAY
[SGC members conduct an extensive archaeological dig. There are tents
set up in the distance. In the foreground, Daniel and Dr. Robert
Rothman excavate a skeleton.]
DANIEL
Look at this.
ROTHMAN
I know!
DANIEL
It's beautiful.
ROTHMAN
Female...Queen!
DANIEL
I think so, look at the dorsal structure.
[A skeleton is half uncovered in the shallow pit. Daniel picks up his
dictaphone and starts recording with it.]
DANIEL
SG-11, Archaeological survey P3X-888, dig site four...
ROTHMAN
Five!
DANIEL
...Five. Subject: Queen, primordial Goa'uld, as evidenced by the
enlarged pectoral musculature and dorsal structure. This Goa'uld
ancestor appears to have been a...
ROTHMAN
(interrupting)
Cleopatra!
[Daniel stops recording and looks at Rothman.]
ROTHMAN
Well I found her I get to name her...so Cleo.
[Daniel resumes his recording and Rothman smiles and continues
digging.]
DANIEL
Cleo as she has been so colourfully named by Robert Rothman appears
to have been a predator, not parasitical. Confirming my theory that
the Goa'uld evolved for millions of years in the prehistoric oceans
of this planet before ever taking on hosts.
[Rothman takes a small sample from the skeletal remains of the
Goa'uld.]
ROTHMAN
Lets get a sedimentary time line before we jump to conclusions here,
please.
DANIEL
(recording)
Err...testing for Naquadah levels.
[Rothman places the sample in a clear container that Daniel is holding.
There is already some liquid in the container, which Daniel then mixes.
They both examine the container.]
DANIEL
Wow, nothing, not even trace amounts!
ROTHMAN
We didn't find any Naquadah in Brutus or Julius either.
DANIEL
It must have became part of their Goa'uld makeup later in their
evolution, that's significant.
ROTHMAN
How so?
[Daniel is still staring at the container puzzled.]
DANIEL
I have no idea...err lets crate this one.
(He turns to one of the SGC personnel in the background)
Loeder!
[Loeder stands and starts walking over to them.]
[From behind the bushes, a creature, breathing heavily, approaches the
dig. The encampment is viewed from its point of view, which is slightly
blurry and more green than usual.]
[Meanwhile, Rothman offers Daniel some water from a flask.]
ROTHMAN
Have some.
[Daniel looks at him distractedly.]
DANIEL
No, thank you.
ROTHMAN
Go ahead, Hawkins can make a water run.
(He stands)
I love ordering those military types around...Hawkins!
[Hawkins looks up annoyed at Rothman as he approaches. Daniel looks up
as Loeder approaches.]
DANIEL
Err...mark this one Cleo and don't ask.
[Loeder raises his eyebrows at Daniel. Daniel gathers some of the
samples and moves away from 'Cleo'.]
UNAS POINT OF VIEW
[The creature watches Daniel move away from the dig and edges closer.]
REGULAR POV
[Daniel places the samples on a table nearby. Loeder is sorting through
the dig site. He suddenly hears a twig snap and looks up. He sees
nothing and resumes his work.]
UNAS POV
[The creature slowly moves closer to the edge of the trees near to
Daniel and Loeder.]
REGULAR POV
[Daniel writes something down whilst Loeder is working. Loeder hears a
sound again and stands cautiously.]
UNAS POV
[The creature runs up to Loeder who draws his gun and fires at it.
Rothman and the other SGC members turn around in surprise at the sound
of the gunfire. The creature knocks Loeder easily to the ground then
knocks a very surprised Daniel to the ground. Daniel hits the ground
hard, unconscious and is dragged away by the creature. Rothman and the
others run towards the creature.]
ROTHMAN
(in the background)
Daniel!
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activates, and armed soldiers gather at the foot of the
ramp. The alarm siren sounds in the background.]
INTERCOM VOICE
Unscheduled off world activation.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Sgt Davis is at the main console as Hammond, O'Neill, Teal'c and
Carter enter the room staring at the activating Gate.]
DAVIS
It's SG-11, sir.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
DAVIS
Yes, sir. The iris is opened.
CARTER
Daniel's with them isn't he?
HAMMOND
They're not due to check in for two more days.
[They exit the control room and head to the Gate room.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[A very scruffy looking Rothman exits the Gate. He is out of breath and
has been running. He proceeds down the ramp. Hammond and SG-1 enter the
room. The armed soldiers lower their weapons.]
HAMMOND
Dr. Rothman, what is it? What happened?
[Rothman is too out of breath to quickly respond. He sits down on the
edge of the ramp.]
O'NEILL
Where's the rest of your team?
ROTHMAN
Loeder's dead. Some sort of indigenous life form. It killed Loeder.
The rest of my team went after it!
[O'Neill looks at him alarmed.]
O'NEILL
Daniel?
ROTHMAN
No, no, no. It took Daniel. That's why the others went after it.
CARTER
How long ago?
ROTHMAN
I don't know, maybe three hours! I...Daniel is still alive! That
thing was dragging him!
O'NEILL
You saw it?
ROTHMAN
Just for a second...
[O'Neill looks at Hammond.]
O'NEILL
Request permission to lead search and rescue, sir?
[Hammond gives a nod.]
ROTHMAN
But if I had a guess, I'd say it was an Unas!
[O'Neill looks at him shocked.]
O'NEILL
A what?
ROTHMAN
It was like that...that thing you described in your mission report
from Cimmeria!
[Still out of breath, Rothman takes a breath from his inhaler.]
O'NEILL
(to Hammond)
Basically we're talking about a Goa'uld with teeth and claws, sir.
TEAL'C
Not necessarily, O'Neill.
HAMMOND
What do you mean?
CARTER
Daniel believed that 888 was the planet from which all Goa'uld
symbiotes originated.
TEAL'C
It may be that there are Unas there that have never been taken as
hosts.
O'NEILL
We're still talking about a big, stinky monster! Makes no
difference.
TEAL'C
Indeed it does. These Unas will be far more primitive and lack the
regenerative powers of Unas we have previously encountered.
CARTER
So what would a primitive Unas want with Daniel?
[O'Neill looks at Hammond.]
O'NEILL
Recommend units one and two, P-90's. I also recommend we take off
right now, sir.
HAMMOND
You have a go.
O'NEILL
Thank you!
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c run off to gear up. Hammond stares down at
Rothman who is still sat on the ramp.]
EXT--P3X-888, DAY
[Daniel is on the ground, unconscious. He begins to wake up and opens
his eyes. The Unas growls nearby. Daniel looks around and sees that his
hands are tightly bound in front of him. The rope leads from his hands
to the Unas, who is standing near him. The Unas paces impatiently. He
is wearing crude clothing and there is a wound on his hand from
Loeder's gunshots. Daniel raises his head off the ground and looks
around for means of escape. But the Unas senses this and turns sharply
round. He growls at Daniel and then drags him to his feet by the rope.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[The UAV fires up and flies through the active Stargate to search for
Daniel. Hammond and Sgt Davis are monitoring the events from the
control room. Carter, Teal'c and members of other SG teams are
assembled at the foot of the ramp. They are all looking at O'Neill, who
moves to the top of the ramp to address them.]
O'NEILL
All right, listen up! We're a little pressed for time here so this
is going to have to serve as your mission briefing. Daniel Jackson
has been dragged off by a creature called an Unas. This is a search
and rescue. Any questions?
[Rothman enters the Gate room, still pulling his coat on.]
ROTHMAN
Err, yes, I have one. When exactly were you going to tell me when we
were leaving?
[O'Neill slowly puts his cap on looking at Rothman.]
O'NEILL
I wasn't.
[Rothman looks surprised.]
ROTHMAN
Oh.
O'NEILL
(to everyone)
Move out!
[The SG teams start to go up the ramp and through the Gate pushing past
Rothman. He goes through the Gate with Teal'c.]
EXT--P3X-888, DAY
[The SG teams span out defensively around the Stargate. O'Neill talks
about the situation with Major Coburn.]
COBURN
The Stargate is secure, sir.
O'NEILL
Make sure it stays that way, sergeant.
COBURN
Yes, sir.
[Coburn walks off to his team. O'Neill tries to contact SG-11 via the
radio.]
O'NEILL
Sierra golf one-one-niner, this is sierra golf one-niner, come in.
[There is no reply.]
O'NEILL
Sierra golf leader do you read?
[Carter approaches looking at a readout of the UAV.]
CARTER
Sir, the UAV is switched to automatic and is flying a search
pattern. Nothing yet.
[O'Neill looks at his watch as Teal'c approaches.]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson would have contacted us by radio by now if he were
able.
CARTER
What about SG-11?
O'NEILL
Well, they could all be out of range.
TEAL'C
The Unas would be capable of traversing great distances in a short
time.
O'NEILL
Well, we know they're not here. Teal'c, take point. Pierce, you've
got our six!
PIERCE
Yes, sir!
O'NEILL
Rothman, you're with me.
[Rothman looks up from blowing his nose and follows. Major Griff pushes
him along. They all set off on the search.]
EXT--FOREST OF P3X-888, DAY
[The Unas drags Daniel by the rope attached to his bound wrists. Daniel
is stumbling and is obviously exhausted.]
DANIEL
(out of breath)
Ok, I know it seems completely unlikely that you understand a word
I'm saying but err...I've gone about as far as I can go at this
particular place, so, with your permission, I'm going to fall down
now!
[He collapses to the ground, exhausted. The Unas stops and looks at him
angrily.]
DANIEL
Rest! This is a thing you should err...become familiar with!
Rest...it means err...rest!
[The Unas growls at him angrily, and he rears back startled.]
DANIEL
That's close...try again...GRRRESSST!
[The Unas stares at Daniel who reaches into his pocket and retrieves
his radio.]
DANIEL
This, this is err...nothing that you need to be worried about. This
is a radio. It's err...so my friends can find me and shoot you!
[Daniel sits up to use the radio. He stands and the creature looks at
him as he activates the radio.]
DANIEL
Err...this is Daniel Jackson. If anyone can hear me...
[The creature swipes the radio angrily out of Daniel's hand where it
crashes against a tree. He then jerks Daniel's ropes and knocks him to
the ground.]
DANIEL
(out of breath)
Ok, I get it, no more radio. Radio bad! Do you speak any kind of
language at all? I mean you must be intelligent. I mean, you made
that necklace and those clothes.
[Daniel gestures to the simple clothing and large bone necklace. The
creature drags him to his feet and starts walking again.]
DANIEL
(sarcastically)
Ah yeah, yep that was refreshing, thank you. I'm good for another
ten miles!
EXT--P3X-888 FURTHER BACK IN FOREST, DAY
[The search party is walking through the forest.]
CARTER
Sir!
O'NEILL
Yeah!
CARTER
Fairly strong RDF signal. It's gone now. Not long enough to
triangulate.
ROTHMAN
So...so what does that mean?
ROTHMAN
Daniel might have tried to use his radio.
GRIFF
Could be SG-11.
CARTER
UAV picked up something. I can't explain why it died out.
O'NEILL
All right let's pick it up!
[They increase the pace of the search.]
EXT--P3X-888 FOREST NEAR RIVER, DAY
[Daniel is still being dragged along by the Unas. They come to a river
and the Unas stops. He looks at the sky to see two moons. Daniel takes
the opportunity for rest and drops to the ground.]
DANIEL
Yes, rest! This is err...this is good. This is rest.
[He lies down and closes his eyes. The Unas crouches down and seems to
perform a kind of chant. Daniel hears this and looks up at him. He sits
up.]
DANIEL
Is this some sort of meditation or...?
[The Unas ignores him and continues chanting. Daniel reaches into his
left jacket pocket and brings out the recorder he was using at the dig
site. He activates it and begins recording cautiously so as not to
alarm or disturb the Unas.]
DANIEL
This is Doctor Daniel Jackson. In case anybody finds this, I've met
a wonderful new friend, and he's taking me on a long journey to see
his friends.
[The Unas hears him and suddenly stops chanting and looks at Daniel.]
DANIEL
(to Unas)
I'm just making notes. (into recorder)
At the moment, my main concern is that my new friend is an
aboriginal Unas in its un-Goa'ulded state, and that I'm the evening
meal.
[Daniel looks at the chanting Unas.]
DANIEL
It err...or rather, he appears to have undeveloped chin and facial
horns which indicate he could be a subspecies. Possibly a juvenile.
[The Unas growls at Daniel who stops talking.]
DANIEL
Shut up?
[The Unas snorts.]
DANIEL
I understood that...
(into recorder)
We're communicating.
UNAS</br> A cha'ka. A cha'ka. A cha'ka. A cha'ka. A cha'ka.
[Daniel stares at him as he chants. He aims the recorder at the Unas.]
DANIEL
Schakka...Schakka...Chaka!
[The Unas stops and stares amazed at Daniel.]
DANIEL
Is that what you call yourself? Chaka? Daniel, I'm Daniel. Chaka is
something else?
[The creature looks at him and growls slightly. Daniel looks at the
sky.]
DANIEL
Is Chaka the moon? This is some sort of moon chant?
[The Unas looks at Daniel with wide eyes, surprised.]
DANIEL
(gesturing with bound hands)
Moons coming into alignment?
[The Unas becomes angry and growls loudly at Daniel. Daniel ducks his
head.]
DANIEL
(to himself)
Moon chant, what was I thinking?
[Suddenly the sound of the UAV overhead is heard. The Unas stands up
alarmed]
UNAS
Shesh!
DANIEL
Shesh, what is that?
UNAS
Chaka, keka! Shesh! Chaka keka! Shesh!
[The Unas points at the UAV as it flies overhead.]
DANIEL
UAV!
[He makes a symbol for the UAV with his hands and points at it.]
DANIEL
UAV! It's my friends looking for me.
UNAS
Shesh! Chaka keka!
DANIEL
You're frightened! It's ok, it won't hurt you. It won't hurt you.
[The creature calms down, and they both stare at each other.]
EXT--P3X-888 FOREST, DAY
[The search team is still walking through the forest. Teal'c is at the
front followed by O'Neill, Carter and Rothman. O'Neill speaks into his
radio.]
O'NEILL
Sierra golf one-one-niner this is sierra golf one niner. Come in?
We're somewhere on your six joining the search, do you read?
(To Carter)
Where the hell is Hawkins?
CARTER
UAV will have run out of fuel by now.
ROTHMAN
Maybe an Unas got him.
[He takes a drink of water from his flask as Carter and O'Neill look
back at him.]
EXT--P3X-888, BANK BY BODY OF WATER, DAY
[A snake like being swims quickly past in the water. The Unas drags
Daniel away from the water. Daniel pulls back and stops.]
DANIEL
Hey!
[He points at the body of water with his bound hands.]
DANIEL
Water...I need water.
[The Unas scans round the area then approaches the river with Daniel.
Daniel kneels down and puts his mouth near the water to take a drink.
The Unas sees him do this and drags him up. Daniel stares angrily at
the Unas as it shows him to cup the water in his hands to drink away
from the water edge. Daniel shows the Unas his hands tied to the rope
preventing him from cupping the water. The Unas grudgingly puts the
rope down on the ground to let Daniel drink. Daniel takes some water
and drinks it and splashes it over his face. He then sees that the Unas
is not looking and grabs the rope and makes a run for it. The Unas
follows in pursuit.]
EXT--P3X-888 DIG CAMP, DAY
[The search team approaches the camp cautiously and fans out to inspect
the area for hostiles. O'Neill and Carter check inside the tents with
their weapons drawn whilst the others stand guard.]
EXT--FURTHER ALONG EMBANKMENT, DAY
[Daniel runs from the Unas. He hears it approaching and sees it come
near. Daniel backs into the water to get away from it as the Unas seems
to be scared of the water. Nearby, one of the snake-like creatures
watches watches Daniel as he backs into it. Daniel swims across the
river and approaches the opposite bank. But the Unas has circled around
and is waiting for him. Daniel stops and stares at the Unas. Suddenly
there is a ripple in the water and it is obvious that something in the
water is approaching Daniel. Daniel makes a decision and hurries out of
the water The being is Goa'uld symbiote, which leaps out of the water
at Daniel. Just as it reaches a shocked Daniel the Unas grabs it,
twists it and breaks its head off. He then grabs a scared looking
Daniel and smears the bright blue blood of the Goa'uld over Daniel's
face.]
UNAS
Keka, keka, keka!
[Daniel backs away slowly.]
DANIEL
(out of breath)
Keka. Keka means dead? Danger?
[The Unas growls, looks around, and pulls at Daniel's rope as he
attempts to edge towards the water.]
UNAS
Ka!
DANIEL
Ok, ka means no.
[The Unas strikes out and knocks Daniel to the ground. Daniel looks up
at him.]
DANIEL
Right, I won't do that again.
[The Unas pulls Daniel to his feet, and they set off again.]
EXT--P3X-888 DIG CAMP, DAY
[Rothman, O'Neill, Teal'c and the rest of the search team approach the
spot where Daniel and Loeder were attacked.]
ROTHMAN
(pointing)
Loeder was killed over there.
[O'Neill uses hand signals to get the others to fan out and secure the
area. Major Griff and another soldier approach the edge of the woods
where the body of Loeder lays.]
TEAL'C
He appears to have been killed by a being of great strength.
[Major Griff checks Loeder's body.]
O'NEILL
(to Rothman)
What was Loeder doing?
ROTHMAN
Packing up fossilised Goa'uld for transport back to earth.
[Major Griff looks in the soil around Loeder's body and picks up some
items.]
O'NEILL
You guys weren't doing anything that would have provoked an attack?
ROTHMAN
I, err...I don't know!
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
You know, Rothman, I'm so glad you came!
[Teal'c walks near to Loeder's body.]
ROTHMAN
Ok, then no, I doubt it very much. You see we'd been at the dig for
three weeks doing exactly what Loeder's been doing for three weeks.
[Major Griff approaches.]
GRIFF
Look at this.
[He shows them a handful of bullets.]
GRIFF
They got off a hell of a lot of shots.
TEAL'C
Our theory appears to be correct O'Neill. The stride, width, and
shape of these footprints appear to be consistent with that of an
Unas.
O'NEILL
Can you track it?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
[One of the soldiers who went into the forest approaches with a visibly
shocked Major Hawkins.]
SOLDIER
Colonel O'Neill! We found him just standing there, staring off into
space.
HAWKINS
Colonel?
[O'Neill approaches Hawkins cautiously.]
O'NEILL
Where's the rest of your men?
HAWKINS
We were attacked. Sanchez is dead for sure. I don't know what
happened after that. We got split up...I was hoping some of them
might have made it back.
[He stares around confused.]
ROTHMAN
Oh god!
CARTER
Major, we've been trying to contact you for the last few hours.
[Hawkins looks down for his radio that isn't there. They all look at
him in sympathy.]
HAWKINS
(to O'Neill)
My men are dead, aren't they?
[O'Neill puts a hand on his shoulder.]
O'NEILL
Look, Hawkins. I can't spare anybody to take you back to the
Stargate. You're going to have to stick with us. Can you do that?
HAWKINS
(in shock)
Whatever you say, sir.
O'NEILL
Let's move out!
[They set off again following the trail of the Unas.]
EXT--P3X-888 CAVE ENTRANCE, DUSK
[The Unas is dragging Daniel into a dark cave. It picks up a large
stick at the entrance.]
EXT--P3X-888, NEAR EMBANKMENT, DUSK
[The search team is near the river. Teal'c is examining one of the Unas
footprints there. Carter approaches O'Neill and points at Rothman who
is bending over and out of breath using his inhaler.]
CARTER
Sir, I think we should rest.
O'NEILL
All right, go to ground. Boots on. No fire!
[Carter nods.]
O'NEILL
I'll take first watch.
[They all walk into the woods and O'Neill sits down by the riverbank.
One of the Goa'uld in the river is watching him.]
INT--CAVE
[The dead Goa'uld is roasting on a spit above an open fire. The Unas
lifts the head up, and Daniel looks at it in disgust. The Unas puts it
back over the fire.]
DANIEL
Is this your cave...your cave?
[The Unas just looks at him and growls lowly.]
DANIEL
It's nice!
[The Unas takes the Goa'uld out of the fire and off the spit. He throws
it towards Daniel who just stares down at it. The Unas then takes the
other end of the Goa'uld for himself. He points at the Goa'uld in front
of Daniel.]
UNAS
Nan!
[The Unas then takes a bite out of the Goa'uld.]
DANIEL
Nan.
[Daniel picks up the Goa'uld head.]
DANIEL
Nan is Goa'uld? It's err...a symbiote?
[Daniel makes a sound and a signal of the Goa'uld flying through the
air. The Unas stares at him and growls.]
UNAS
Ka. Nan!
[He takes another bite of the Goa'uld while pointedly looking at
Daniel.]
DANIEL
Eat, nan is eat, of course!...No, you know, if I am the main course,
I'd rather you fill up on the appetisers.
[He throws the Goa'uld head on the floor.]
DANIEL
So no...err ka!
[The Unas picks up the Goa'uld head and throws it back at Daniel.]
UNAS
Nan!
[Daniel throws it away again.]
DANIEL
Ka!
[They do this about three times and Daniel begins to laugh. The Unas
also laughs.]
DANIEL
(laughing)
Right err...yes, toss the symbiote head! That's very, very popular,
very interesting. Yes, all the kids are doing this.
[Daniel throws it into the fire.]
DANIEL
Oh look out! In the fire but...
[Daniel reaches into his pocket and brings out a chocolate bar.]
DANIEL
Nan!
UNAS
Ka!
DANIEL
Now don't say ka until you've tried it!
[He unwraps the bar and the Unas sniffs at it.]
DANIEL
Nan!
[Daniel takes a bite of the bar.]
DANIEL
Mmmnnnn!
[The Unas tries to make a similar sound. Daniel offers him the bar. The
Unas sniffs it more and licks it. Then takes a bite. He attempts to
make a Mmmnnn sound.]
DANIEL
Mmmnnnn!
UNAS
Mmmnnnn!
DANIEL
That's funny, I err...met my father-in-law like this!
[The Unas continues making mmmnnnn sounds.]
DANIEL
Yeah, like that!
EXT-CAMP IN FOREST, NIGHT
[Members of the search team are asleep on the ground. O'Neill is awake
and sitting up next to a sleeping Rothman. Hawkins is asleep nearby
with his back to the others.]
O'NEILL
(whispering)
Rothman?
[Rothman murmurs in his sleep but doesn't wake up so O'Neill throws his
hat at him. Rothman sits up suddenly awake.]
ROTHMAN
(sleepily)
What? Colonel?
O'NEILL
Have you noticed anything weird about Hawkins?
ROTHMAN
(sleepily)
Weird?
O'NEILL
Different.
ROTHMAN
Different?
O'NEILL
Odd.
ROTHMAN
Odd?
O'NEILL
(annoyed)
Rothman!
ROTHMAN
Oh, I'm still not awake yet, Colonel. I'm sorry.
O'NEILL
Well, you work with him! Just tell me if you notice anything out of
the ordinary.
[Rothman pulls his glasses on and squints at Hawkins. Carter, who is
awake nearby, also looks at Hawkins who is still asleep.]
ROTHMAN
He seems like...Hawkins. I mean, that's the way he is.
O'NEILL
You sure?
ROTHMAN
No, it's not my thing.
O'NEILL
What isn't?
ROTHMAN
People. I mean, give me a million year old fossil, and I'll tell you
what it had for breakfast but I'm not too good at people. They're
too recent!
[He lies back down and goes to sleep. Carter and O'Neill exchange
looks. Back facing the rest of the group, Hawkins's eyes suddenly open
and glow like a Goa'uld.]
INT--CAVE
[The Unas sits near to the fire watching it. Daniel stands nearby
looking at paintings on the cave walls. His hands are still tied as he
activates the recorder and starts talking.]
DANIEL
I'm in a cave. There are crude drawings, pictographs. The Unas seems
to have a comprehension of Goa'uld symbiote species structure as
well as their ability to blend.
[He walks deeper into the caves, observing the drawings on the walls.]
DANIEL
Obviously the Unas who were taken over must have figured out how to
work the Stargate and left, but...why not all of them?
[Daniel turns and looks at his captor.]
DANIEL
This Unas wears a strange bony neckpiece. At first, I thought it was
purely ornamental, but now I suspect it must serve as some small
safeguard to protect against symbiotes penetrating the neck.
[He again looks at the paintings.]
DANIEL
Some of the aboriginal Unas must have realised that their kind were
being taken over and taken refuge in these caves!
[Daniel looks at the drawings on the walls depicting Unas hunting
captives. He edges further into the caves.]
DANIEL
This is a rite of passage. There are parallels in earth culture. For
example, the Massai warriors of Africa kill lions in order to be
recognised as adult warriors.
[A growl is heard from behind, and Daniel spins round to see the Unas
standing immediately behind him.]
DANIEL
I think I understand what it is you are doing!
[The Unas grabs Daniel and presses him against the wall.]
UNAS
Wok tah!
[He then uses his claw to cut a long scratch down Daniel's face,
drawing blood.]
DANIEL
Ka!
[The Unas lets him go from the wall and looks at him.]
DANIEL
Keka?
[The Unas pushes Daniel away from the wall and rubs the blood from
Daniel's face onto the cave wall next to a depiction of an Unas with a
captive human. Daniel stares on horrified.]
DANIEL
I think I've just been marked for death!
EXT--CAMP IN FOREST, DAY
[Teal'c is standing near the water's edge, looking over the water.
Carter approaches and calls to him.]
CARTER
Teal'c, we're moving out!
[Teal'c turns his back on the water. A symbiote in the water prepares
to attack. Teal'c senses this and activates his staff weapon. Just as
the symbiote flies out of the water at him, he fires on it killing it.
The others come running at the staff weapon noise. Teal'c aims the
weapon at them.]
TEAL'C
Come no closer!
[They stop and look at Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
What was that?
TEAL'C
Lower your weapons!
O'NEILL
What?!?
TEAL'C
One or more of you may have become host to a Goa'uld during your
watch!
[They all look surprised.]
CARTER
Teal'c, that doesn't make any sense! I don't sense...
TEAL'C
(interrupting)
You yourself may have been compromised.
O'NEILL
Well, what makes you think there are Goa'uld around here?
TEAL'C
These waters abound with them.
[The water is still bubbling where other symbiotes feed on the dead
Goa'uld.]
TEAL'C
Anyone who has ventured near the edge has put themselves at risk!
ROTHMAN
No, the Goa'uld fossils we found are a millions of years old! I've
been on this planet for weeks.
TEAL'C
Then perhaps you maintain the pretence of being human!
ROTHMAN
(sarcastically)
I think I would know if there was a snake in my head.
O'NEILL
Carter?
CARTER
I can't explain it, sir. I can't even sense the ones that are in the
water.
ROTHMAN
Daniel and I found no traces of Naquadah in the symbiote fossils.
Maybe that's why...
TEAL'C
(interrupting)
Enough! Relinquish your weapons immediately!
GRIFF
Hold on! How do we know you're not one of them?
CARTER
Symbiotes can't blend with a Jaffa.
GRIFF
Yeah, well look at my neck. Do you see a scar?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld may enter through the mouth leaving no visible scar.
Therefore it may be impossible to tell who among you has been taken
and who has not.
CARTER
Sir, Teal'c is right. He's the only one we can be sure of, including
you and me.
[O'Neill looks at Teal'c considering the situation. He then puts his
weapon on the ground.]
O'NEILL
Do as he says.
[The others comply with reserve.]
CARTER
What about Daniel?
TEAL'C
None of you can be trusted to proceed.
GRIFF
You think you can bring Daniel back alone?
TEAL'C
I do, and I will.
[Teal'c activates his radio to speak to Coburn and his team who are
still guarding the Gate.]
TEAL'C
(to Coburn)
Sergeant Coburn?
EXT-P3X-888 STARGATE, DAY
COBURN
(activating radio)
Coburn.
TEAL'C
(via radio)
One or more of our team may have been compromised by a Goa'uld
parasite.
[Coburn and the other soldier exchange worried glances.]
COBURN
How many?
TEAL'C
(via radio)
That may be impossible to determine until we return with them to
Earth.
EXT-P3X-888 BY WATER, DAY
[Teal'c looks at the others. His staff weapon is still aimed at the
search team.]
TEAL'C
I intend to restrain them at this location and proceed onward alone.
O'NEILL
What?!?
TEAL'C
(via radio)
I will leave this frequency open so that you may locate them and
return to the SGC. Take extreme caution.
COBURN
(via radio)
We're on our way. Coburn out.
[Teal'c takes restraints out of his pack and throws them at the feet of
Colonel O'Neill who looks down at them.]
TEAL'C
Bind their hands and feet tight with those. I will then do the same
to you, O'Neill.
[He stares at O'Neill.]
INT--CAVE
[Daniel lies on the floor of the cave awake. The Unas is asleep nearby.
Daniel sits up slowly and looks at the Unas. He picks up a large stone
to hit the Unas in the head. But then he looks at the sleeping Unas and
can't go ahead with killing it. He lets the stone fall to the ground
with a loud thump. The Unas wakes up and, seeing the stone, growls at
Daniel. Daniel holds his hands up.]
DANIEL
It's ok, it's ok.
[The Unas leans on its hand that was injured by the soldier's gunfire,
and reacts with pain.]
DANIEL
Look, I can help you with that, if you let me.
[He points at the wound on the Unas'hand.]
DANIEL
But you have to trust me!
[The Unas looks down at his hand, which is bleeding with a green blood.
He then looks back up at Daniel.]
EXT--P3X-888 CAMP BY WATER, DAY
[The others are already tied up. O'Neill is now being restrained by
Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
(quietly to Teal'c)
I'm tellin' ya, it's got to be Hawkins.
TEAL'C
Trust in me, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
What if I'm not O'Neill?
TEAL'C
Then I was not talking to you.
[Teal'c walks away, leaving them tied up.]
GRIFF
(annoyed)
What if one of those Unas come by? What do we do then?
CARTER
Teal'c didn't have any other choice, Captain!
GRIFF
(scoffing)
Yeah?
[Hawkins watches the others, looking mad.]
INT--CAVE
[Daniel works on the Unas's hand using some tweezers. The Unas is
breathing hard as Daniel pulls the bullet out.]
DANIEL
I don't suppose you know the story of Androcles and the lion?
[The Unas stares at the splinter.]
UNAS
(looking at Daniel)
Chaka!
[Daniel looks at him confused. He has a long wound on his cheek from
the Unas claw.]
DANIEL
What is Chaka?
[The Unas looks away.]
DANIEL
Look, obviously we don't need to be enemies here. I mean err...I
want to go home. I mean, don't get me wrong, it has been a hoot but
err...I did just pass up the chance to kill you so...
[The Unas pulls on the rope lead for the binding on Daniel's hands.
Daniel looks at him, annoyed.]
DANIEL
(quietly)
Please, let me go!
[Daniel picks up a piece of charcoal from the remains of the fire as
the Unas pulls him to his feet, and they set off further into the
caves. On the way past one wall, Daniel stops and quickly writes
something on it. The Unas looks at the writing confused and then drags
Daniel off again.]
EXT--CAMP BY WATER, DAY
[The search party, minus Teal'c, are still restrained and sitting at
the camp.]
ROTHMAN
This is ridiculous, I'm not a Goa'uld!
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Well then, why didn't you say so? We could have straightened this
whole thing out!
[Major Hawkins struggles quietly with his restraints. His wrists are
cut from the struggling.]
HAWKINS
So which one of you is it?
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
All right, anybody with a snake in their head raise their hands!
[Hawkins's eyes glow suddenly. He breaks his restraints and stands up.]
O'NEILL
Damn! Err...Teal'c!
[Hawkins makes his way over to O'Neill, picking up a weapon on the
way.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c...Teal'c...Teal'c!
[Hawkins prepares to fire at O'Neill. Just as he is about to shoot he
is shot in the back twice by a staff weapon. His eyes glow once more
and then fade out as he falls to the ground face first. Teal'c appears
from the forest and walks over to O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Well, that took you long enough.
[Teal'c leans down to release O'Neill of his bindings.]
TEAL'C
You are welcome, O'Neill. I knew if there was a Goa'uld among you he
would be strong enough to free himself.
[O'Neill nods as Teal'c goes to free the others.]
CARTER
You had to wait long enough to make sure Hawkins wasn't the only
one?
TEAL'C
(smiles briefly)
Yes!
GRIFF
(to Teal'c)
Are you satisfied now?
TEAL'C
I am.
[Teal'c goes to free Rothman.]
ROTHMAN
I'm glad that's over with!
[Teal'c frees Rothman's feet but as he goes to free his hands he
notices that Rothman too has been struggling to free his hands, and
there is blood around his wrists. Teal'c looks at him confused as
Rothman's eyes glow. Rothman breaks his wrist bindings, stands up,
knocking Teal'c to the ground, and grabs his staff weapon. He manages
to fire at Griff in the shoulder just as Griff is standing. As Griff
falls, O'Neill grabs his weapon and fires repeatedly at Rothman,
killing him. O'Neill stares at Rothman's body in shock. Carter runs to
help Griff, who is lying on the ground holding his shoulder in pain.
Teal'c recovers and goes to free Pierce. ]
O'NEILL
(to Griff)
You going to live?
GRIFF
(in pain)
Yeah, I think so!
O'NEILL
Meet up with Coburn. Head back to the Stargate.
GRIFF
Yeah! How long do you figure he was a Goa'uld?
PIERCE
Could have been the whole time, we just didn't know.
CARTER
They deserve a decent burial, sir.
O'NEILL
Yes, they do.
GRIFF
We'll take care of it, sir. Go find Doctor Jackson.
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Yeah.
INT-CAVE
[The Unas leads Daniel into a large cavern. Daniel is still making
markings on the walls. The sounds of other Unas are heard.]
EXT--CAVE ENTRANCE, DAY
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c enter the cave with their weapons drawn.
The find the remains of the fire, and Teal'c bends down to inspect it.]
TEAL'C
We are very close behind.
[They then discover the cave paintings and see the smear of Daniel's
blood next to a drawing.]
O'NEILL
It's red. There's not much of it. That's something.
TEAL'C
This way!
[Teal'c is looking at the markings that Daniel made. O'Neill approaches
and shines his light on the markings. They read 'this way' with an
arrow underneath them.]
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
You're good!
[They move further into the caves.]
INT-MAIN CAVERN
[The Unas leads Daniel into a large cavern that is obviously inhabited
by the Unas of the planet. There are fires and other items all over the
place.]
DANIEL
Look, I know we've got the beginnings of a beautiful friendship
here, but I'm not sure your folks are going to understand.
[A loud deep growl is heard and the shadow of a large Unas can be seen
from another entrance to the cavern. Daniel stops with his captor and
looks on in fear. The large Unas appears and approaches them growling
loudly. The young Unas cowers back.]
INT-CAVE TUNNELS
[SG-1 are following Daniel's markings to the cavern. They hear the
growls of the Unas nearby and hurry on.]
INT-MAIN CAVERN
[The alpha male approaches Daniel, but the young Unas steps in front to
talk to him.]
UNAS
Ka! Ka keka!
[The alpha male looks down at the young one growling.]
UNAS
Ka nan, tok! Chaka, ska nat, Chaka!
[At that moment SG-1 enter with their weapons drawn ready to fire.
Daniel sees them and puts his hands up to stop them.]
DANIEL
Don't, don't! Don't shoot!
[SG-1 stop and take defensive positions.]
[The alpha male sees the others and roars very loudly. Other Unas
appear from further inside the caves. They start to move forward but
the young Unas talks again. He is pleading with the alpha male for
Daniel's life evidently.]
UNAS
(to alpha male)
Cho'ee'che!
DANIEL
(to others)
This started out as some sort of rite of passage. I think the alpha
male was expecting the younger one to offer me up for some kind of
feast.
UNAS
(to alpha male)
Tok. Chaka, ka nan!
DANIEL
Instead I think the younger one's trying to bring me into his clan.
CARTER
Why?
DANIEL
We've communicated. We're friends!
O'NEILL
Friends?!?
[One of the other Unas approaches, swinging a club.]
UNAS
Ka!
[O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter aim their weapons. Daniel raises his hand
again to stop them.]
DANIEL
Don't! I think the younger one's trying to tell the clan that he's
found something good for them.
O'NEILL
And they're buying that?
DANIEL
No, I don't think so.
[The alpha male approaches Daniel to attack. Daniel raises his bound
hands to protect himself.]
DANIEL
Ka keka!
[The alpha male stops, surprised, and backs away slightly.]
O'NEILL
Daniel?
CARTER
What did you just say?
[Daniel is staring at the alpha male with a frightened look.]
DANIEL
I think I just asked him not to kill me!
[The alpha male suddenly attacks the young Unas knocking him to the
ground. He then goes for Daniel who ducks to avoid him. Just as the
alpha male approaches, O'Neill and Carter open fire on the alpha male
hitting him several times in the chest. The alpha male staggers back
only wounded and not dead. As it attempts to attack Daniel again the
young Unas recovers and attacks the alpha male. In its wounded state
the alpha male is overpowered and drowned by the young Unas in a
shallow pool. O'Neill and the others look on still ready to fire. The
other Unas from further inside the cave look at the young Unas who then
gives out a loud roar. The other Unas all bow at him.]
DANIEL
He's just become the alpha male.
[The young Unas growls at the others and they retreat back into the
depths of the caves. He then turns to Daniel.]
UNAS
Dan'el?
[The Unas gestures for Daniel to accompany him into the caves. Daniel
shakes his head.]
DANIEL
Ka. I have to go now. Thank you. Chaka.
[The Unas growls softly, turns, and leaves. O'Neill and Carter stand up
from their defensive positions and walk over to Daniel. As the Unas
leaves the cavern, it stops and looks at Daniel.]
UNAS
Chaka!
O'NEILL
What'd that mean?
DANIEL
I have no idea...but I think I've just been invited to come back one
day and find out.
[Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c look at Daniel as the Unas leaves the
cavern.]
FADE OUT
