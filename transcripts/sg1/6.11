[Following scenes are from 5.11 "Desperate Measures"]
CONRAD
The exits are sealed, Major.
CARTER
Who are you? What the hell am I doing here?
CONRAD
My name is Adrian Conrad. You're here because of me.
O'NEILL
(to Maybourne)
What was the three million dollars for?
MAYBOURNE
I acquired a piece of merchandise from the Russians and sold it to
Zetatron.
O'NEILL
What?
MAYBOURNE
A symbiote.
FRAISER
It would appear Adrian Conrad is in the late stages of an extremely
rare disorder known as Burchardt's syndrome. It is a condition that
affects the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to a host of
diseases. And, there's no known cure.
TEAL'C
Except the healing powers of a Goa'uld symbiote.
O'NEILL
(to Conrad)
Where are you going?
[Conrad's Goa'uld is in control of him.]
CONRAD
Shoot me and you'll kill the host.
[O'Neill is shot in the back by Simmons.]
SIMMONS
You want to live, you come with me. Now once you start delivering on
your end of our little bargain, I might be able to move you to
better accommodations.
CONRAD
You cannot offer anything of equal value to the knowledge I possess.
SIMMONS
I am not so sure about that.
FADE OUT
FADE IN TO CURRENT EPISODE
EXT--OUTSIDE A MODERN BUILDING, DAY
[Carter is leaving a building and walking to her car as a woman
approaches her holding a microphone, accompanied by a camerman.]
DONOVAN
Major Carter, my name's Julia Donovan. I'm with Inside Access. I was
wondering if we can have a few minutes of your time.
CARTER
I'm a little busy right now.
[She puts her briefcase in the back seat of her car.]
DONOVAN
Actually, your name came up in connection with a story I have been
working on. Over the past two years several billion dollars of
taxpayers' money has been funneled into a secret government project
called 'Prometheus'. In fact, it is so secret, the government
appropriated the money without the usual congressional oversight,
which I think my viewers might find rather interesting.
CARTER
I'm sure they would.
[She gets into her car.]
DONOVAN
Actually, I thought you might find this particularly interesting.
[She holdes up a small vile with something in it.]
DONOVAN
It is a metal alloy called Trinium. Supposedly it's being used in
connection with 'Prometheus'. I had my experts analyze it. They said
it's unlike anything they've ever seen before; at least on this
planet. Sure you wouldn't care to comment now?
CARTER
I'm sure.
[Carter drives away.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
CARTER
(to Hammond)
To tell you the truth, sir, I didn't know what to say. She caught me
completely off guard.
HAMMOND
You did the right thing, Major. Our official policy is to deny
everything.
CARTER
Unfortunately, in this case I don't think it's going to be good
enough.
HAMMOND
Do you believe the sample of Trinium is genuine?
CARTER
It's hard to say for sure, sir, but just the fact that she knew the
name indicates we've had a serious breach of security.
HAMMOND
The Pentagon has already initiated an investigation. We have tapped
Ms. Donovan's phone and e-mail accounts and we're tracking her
movements.
CARTER
Where is she now?
HAMMOND
She left Colorado Springs at 0930 this morning. She changed planes
in Denver en route to JFK. I am sending Major Davis over from
Washington to talk to her.
CARTER
Do we know when this report is scheduled to air?
HAMMOND
In four days.
EXT--NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHT
[A stretch limo turns a corner.]
DONOVAN
(inside limo, talking on her cell phone)
No, Tuesday's no good, I've got an interview with the Chinese
Ambassador. And then on Wednesday I fly out for the G-8 Summit. I'll
call you back.
(to limo driver)
Why are we stopping?
[Major Davis enters the limo.]
DAVIS
Good evening.
DONOVAN
What is this?
DAVIS
Major Paul Davis, United States Air Force.
DONOVAN
If you came to intimidate me out of running my story, it's not going
to work. Just the fact that you're here tells me it's too important
to let go.
DAVIS
Oh, it's more important than you know.
DONOVAN
Here comes the national security speech.
DAVIS
No, no speech. Just a simple fact: you run that story, you endanger
people's lives.
DONOVAN
All right, you tell me what 'Prometheus' is and I will reconsider.
DAVIS
I don't think so.
DONOVAN
I'm serious. I have unconfirmed reports that it's some kind of
fusion reactor. They are building it out in the desert.
DAVIS
Where'd you hear that?
DONOVAN
I'm not ready to reveal my source.
DAVIS
Ms. Donovan, by revealing classified information, your source is
violating about 17 federal laws.
DONOVAN
Is that a confirmation?
DAVIS
It's a warning.
DONOVAN
You should know, Major, I've made arrangements. If anything happens
to me, the report gets released.
DAVIS
Have a good evening, Ms. Donovan.
[Davis puts on his hat and exits the limo.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Davis and Hammond are walking down the corridor and enter Hammond's
office.]
DAVIS
She's stubborn, Sir.
HAMMOND
Do we know where the leak came from?
DAVIS
We're working on it, but so far we've got nothing. It could be
anything from a technician working on the project to Senator Kinsey.
HAMMOND
How much does she know?
DAVIS
She thinks Prometheus is some kind of fusion reactor.
HAMMOND
Then maybe we don't have a problem.
DAVIS
She also has a money trail, Sir and the Trinium. If she can get that
much, odds are she can get a lot more.
[Hammond picks up his red phone.]
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond. Get me the President.
EXT--NETWORK OFFICES, DAY
INT--TELEVISION NETWORK OFFICE
[Donovan is speaking as she enters and office with a large conference
table.]
DONOVAN
Al, we need to talk about this production schedule.
(seeing Davis and Carter seated at the table next to Al)
What the hell is this?
MARTELL
Take it easy, Julia.
DONOVAN
No, if you think you can kill my story by going over my head to my
producer, you're wrong.
MARTELL
Just sit down, please.
[She sits at the table.]
MARTELL
The head office has decided that for the time being it is in their
best interest not to run the story.
DONOVAN
You mean they caved.
DAVIS
It was a personal request from the President to the chairman of the
corporation that owns this network.
DONOVAN
I don't believe this.
CARTER
We're going to need all of the material you have on this story.
Tapes, notes, interviews...
DONOVAN
You can't force me to give you anything.
DAVIS
Actually we can, but we were just hoping that you'd be willing to
cooperate given that your story is dead.
DONOVAN
You see, that's where you're wrong. All I have to do is make a
couple of phone calls to some foreign broadcasters. I'm sure they
would be very interested.
DAVIS
I'd advise against it.
MARTELL
Okay, okay, look, maybe there's a compromise here. Whatever this
thing is, I figure it is too big to stay secret forever. Am I right?
Eventually, you're going to go public. You let Julia take a camera
crew to document 'Prometheus', top to bottom. When the time is
right, we get a world exclusive.
CARTER
I don't think so.
MARTELL
Everyone will sign a Nondisclosure Agreement, including me. The
videotape will be the property of the United States Air Force.
You'll be in complete control.
DONOVAN
Forget it, they're gonna sit on this thing for 50 years.
MARTELL
Julia, when the President of the United States kills your story,
that's it, game over. You go foreign with this, they could charge
you with treason.
[Donovan appears defiant.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 and Hammond are listening to a briefing by Davis.]
JONAS
Do you think that she would really go through with it?
HAMMOND
We have no way of knowing. And the fact is, we can't take the
chance.
DAVIS
There's also the question of where she's getting her information. If
we kill the story without plugging the leak, there is no guarantee
this won't happen all over again.
JONAS
What are you suggesting?
DONOVAN
Once Ms. Donovan left the meeting, her producer agreed to reveal the
source in exchange for a tour of the facility.
HAMMOND
(seeing O'Neill's incredulity)
The Pentagon feels this is the best way to contain the situation.
Once we've confirmed we have the source, we destroy all videotape
and any related materials.
JONAS
So, essentially we're just double crossing them.
HAMMOND
We have no choice.
DAVIS
Without any hard evidence, the only place she'll be able to run the
story is in the tabloids.
O'NEILL
(emphatically)
This is an insanely bad idea.
HAMMOND
The decision has been made. Major, I want you and Jonas to take care
of this.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
Dismissed.
INT--SOMEWHERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT
[A small building painted in red and white checks is surrounded by a
fence. Two silver SUV's drive up to meet four people standing in front
o the fenced building: Carter, Jonas, and two SF's. Donovan and Martell
get out of one SUV and approach the team.]
CARTER
Ms. Donovan.
DONOVAN
Major.
CARTER
This is Jonas Quinn. He will be joining us on the tour.
MARTELL
(looking at the small building)
I guess a couple billion dollars doesn't buy what it used to.
JONAS
You'd be surprised.
CARTER
Shall we?
[Carter leads them to a door to the building, which she opens to reveal
an elevator door. Carter, Jonas, Donovan and Martell enter the
elevator.]
INT--ELEVATOR AT PROMETHEUS SITE
DONOVAN
How far down are we going?
CARTER
Several hundred feet.
INT--LARGE UNDERGROUND HANGAR
[They exit the elevator.]
CARTER
This is Prometheus, otherwise known as the X-303.
[They see a very large, grey ship sitting in the hangar.]
DONOVAN
Hope you brought a lot of tape.
INT--INSIDE THE X-303
[They are walking down a corridor, now followed by the television
station's film crew.]
DONOVAN
This is a joke. It would take at least 20 Saturn rockets to get this
thing off the ground let alone into orbit.
CARTER
Prometheus is the third in a series of designs that incorporates
both human and alien technology.
MARTELL
You're saying little green men helped you build this?
CARTER
Actually, they're gray. All the key systems were reverse engineered
from a ship that crashed a hundred miles north of Fairbanks, Alaska
in 1978. It was only in the last few years that our technology
evolved to a point where we could take advantage of what we had.
[Carter gestures for them to enter a room as she and Jonas remain in
the corridor.]
JONAS
(quietly)
Fairbanks.
CARTER
Better than Roswell.
INT--BRIDGE OF THE X-303
[There are three command-type chairs and a vertical lighted display.]
DONOVAN
It doesn't look very alien to me.
CARTER
The controls are all standard design. Some of the key systems use
crystal technology rather than wires and chips. The hard part's
making them compatible.
DONOVAN
(to the film crew)
All right, let's set up in here.
(to Carter)
I'd like to see more.
[They exit the bridge, leaving the film crew behind.]
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
CARTER
The ship will be capable of reaching orbit in under 30 seconds.
DONOVAN
What about G forces?
CARTER
Well, if the inertial dampeners and artificial gravity are
functioning properly, it shouldn't feel like much more than a ride
in a fast elevator.
MARTELL
How long until this thing is ready to fly?
CARTER
It'll be a while. A number of the support systems are still being
assembled.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[The film crew is unpacking their cameras and a laptop. Smith takes a
zat from the inside of a movie camera. Jones opens an access panel on
the ship.]
SF SERGEANT
What are you doing?
[He starts to approach them. Smith fires on him and on another SF.
Jones continues to work on her laptop.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Carter ushers Donovan and Martell in from the corridor.]
DONOVAN
What is this?
CARTER
The engine room.
[They walk around and look through interior windows at the hyperdrive
system itself.]
MARTELL
How fast does it go?
CARTER
Using sublight engines, the ship can accelerate to 110,000 miles per
second. It's over half the speed of light.
JONAS
Of course it is nowhere near fast enough to achieve interstellar
travel. For that, we need the hyperdrive.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[The crew is dragging away the unconscious SF's as Jones accesses the
ship's computer system via her laptop.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[There is a high-pitched beeping alarm. Carter goes to a console to
check on it. The console shows "simulation interrupted... system busy"]
JONAS
What is it?
CARTER
I'm not sure. The computer was running a series of hyperdrive
simulations, but they've been interrupted.
JONAS
So?
CARTER
So, there are no other tests scheduled for today.
(into comm system)
Engine room to the bridge. Sergeant Gibson, this is Major Carter,
come in.
JONAS
Maybe the comm system isn't finished yet.
CARTER
I'll go go check it out. Keep an eye on these two.
[She leaves.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[Two crewmen enter with guns, probably taken from the SF's.]
JONES
I think I got it. We're in business.
SMITH
(to the other 2 crewmen)
Go get the others.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[The two meet up with Carter.]
REYNOLDS
Major Carter.
CARTER
Aren't you suppose to be on the bridge?
SANDERSON
We had a little trouble with the equipment. We're going to need to
get another battery from the truck.
[Carter notices something is wrong as Reynolds pulls a gun. She hits
and kicks both of them, knocking their guns away. She runs away down
the corridor as Smith fires the zat at her. Smith and the others get up
to pursue her.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Jonas is accessing the ship's systems.]
DONOVAN
What is it?
JONAS
Someone's trying to lock down the ship. I can't stop them, but I
think I can slow them down.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[The film crew is chasing Carter.]
SANDERSON
Where is she?
SMITH
This way.
[Under pursuit, Carter ducks into a storage room and lowers the door
closed. The others arrive just as it closes and can't get in.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
SMITH
(via a radio)
Jones, come in.
JONES
Go ahead.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
SMITH
(into radio)
I need you to seal a room for me, Charlie Charlie 4-1-0-7.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
JONES
Done.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
SMITH
Let's go.
[They leave Carter sealed in the room.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Jonas enters a command into the console.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
JONES
(seeing a readout on her screen)
Full diagnostic? No, no, no.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Jonas opens a drawer and removes a crystal from the assembly.]
MARTELL
What is that?
JONAS
The control crystal.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
CARTER
(talking into the ship's intercom)
This is Major Carter, can anybody hear me?
[She begins to survey the bits of equipment in the room.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[The film crew rushes into the engine room with weapons drawn.]
DONOVAN
What the hell's going on?
SANDERSON
Shut up.
(gesturing for them to move behind the console)
Over there.
JONES
(via radio)
Smith, come in.
SMITH
(into radio)
Yeah, go ahead.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
JONES
We've got a problem. The computer's been tied up with a diagnostic
program. I need you to shut it down.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
SMITH
Yeah, we got it.
[Sanderson makes inputs at a console.]
SANDERSON
(into radio)
The controls are frozen.
JONES
(via radio)
If you don't close that program, I'm not going to be able to
establish a lock down, and we're going to be overrun by security.
MARTELL
He removed the control crystal.
[Martell takes the control crystal from the overhead bin where Jonas
had hidden it.]
DONOVAN
Al, what are you doing?
MARTELL
It must link the computer to the alien systems.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Carter is looking through the items in the storage room. She finds a
screw driver and removes a cover plate from an electronics box near the
door.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[The console shows the diagnostic test ending.]
JONES
There we go.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Sanderson is working at the computer console. Smith walks over to face
Donovan, still holding a zat.]
DONOVAN
What's happening?
JONAS
They're activating the hyperdrive generators.
DONOVAN
While we're on the ground? Is that such a good idea?
JONAS
No, it's not.
[There is the sounds of engines coming to life.]
JONAS
Unless you're deliberately trying to create an overload.
DONOVAN
I don't understand.
JONAS
The hyperdrive generators create an enormous amount of energy, and
if it's not channeled into creating a hyperspace window, it can
cause some serious problems.
DONOVAN
You mean it could explode.
JONAS
With enough force to turn the entire state of Nevada into a smoking
crater, yes.
SMITH
That's right, but I wouldn't worry about it. As long as our demands
are met, it won't come to that.
EXT--SURFACE ABOVE SHIP'S BASE, DAY
[There is a command center set up with an open-sided tent and
equipment. The rear of a large truck opens and many armed soldiers jump
out and take up positions around the small red and white building. A
silver SUV arrives and O'Neill jumps out and heads toward the command
tent. He is wearing civilian clothing and sunglasses.]
O'NEILL
(yelling)
Major Davis!
[Davis hears him and leaves the tent to meet him.]
O'NEILL
(yelling)
What the hell happened?!
DAVIS
Approximately 0900 this morning, the X-303 was put into lock down
mode. At 0920, we received a communication from someone inside the
ship informing us that they had destabilized the hyperdrive. They're
threatening to blow it.
O'NEILL
I don't believe it.
(yelling)
I do not believe this!
DAVIS
We are getting energy readings that confirm an overload building in
the ship's generator.
O'NEILL
(yelling)
This is supposedly the most secure facility on the face of the
planet!
DAVIS
We think it was the camera crew, Sir.
O'NEILL
Did anyone bother with a background check?
DAVIS
Yes, Sir and they were clean. They're cameraman was a decorated
marine in Somalia. Every member of that crew has been at the network
for well over a year, Sir. This plan has obviously been in the works
for some time.
[A staff sergeant arrives and waits to get their attention.]
O'NEILL
(to sergeant)
What?
TECHNICAL SERGEANT
Sir, we're receiving a transmission. It's from the hijackers.
O'NEILL
Patch it through.
[The enter the command tent.]
DAVIS
(into radio)
This is Major Davis, go ahead.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
SMITH
I assume by now you've confirmed the status of the hyperdrive, so
you know we're not bluffing.
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
DAVIS
What do you want?
SMITH
You are currently holding two prisoners we want released. Colonel
Frank Simmons and Adrian Conrad. You have exactly three hours to
deliver them, or we blow up your ship.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Carter finishes rigging a radio.]
CARTER
(into radio, over static)
This is Major Carter, can anyone hear me?
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
DAVIS
(into phone)
Yes Sir, perfectly clear, Sir. We're doing everything we can. Thank
you.
(to O'Neill)
The Joint Chiefs are calling an emergency meeting.
TECHNICAL SERGEANT
Sir, we are picking up a signal from inside the ship. But it's on a
different frequency.
DAVIS
Patch it through.
CARTER
(via radio)
Repeat, this is Major Carter, is anyone reading this.
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Carter, it's O'Neill. What's your status?
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
CARTER
I'm locked in a storage room on Deck 7.
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
[O'Neill gestures for the sergeant to get the plans for the ship.]
O'NEILL
What happened in there?
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
CARTER
It was the TV crew; they had a zat.
DAVIS
Major, the hijackers are demanding the release of Colonel Simmons
and Adrian Conrad. We believe this is a rogue NID operation.
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
O'NEILL
Carter, is there any chance they can get that ship off the ground?
CARTER
It's not finished, Sir. It could lose structural integrity.
O'NEILL
Will it fly?
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
DAVIS
Major Carter, the sublight control relay is right above you on Deck
8. If you can get to it and sever the connection, that will ground
them for sure.
CARTER
I found a plasma cutter in here, but it will take me a while to get
through the Trinium alloy.
DAVIS
We have less than three hours to deliver the prisoners before they
blow the ship.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
CARTER
Copy that.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Donovan and Jonas are sitting on the floor as Martell paces.]
DONOVAN
Al, why are you doing this?
MARTELL
They're paying me.
DONOVAN
We're supposed to be friends.
MARTELL
They're paying me a lot.
JONAS
Hey, you know there's only two ways off of this ship, don't you?
Handcuffs or a body bag.
SANDERSON
Who says we want to get off?
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Carter puts on a welding helmet and activates the plasma cutter, and
begins to try cutting through the door.]
EXT--NEVADA DESERT
INT--A LARGE BLACK VAN
[Davis and Simmons are inside the van along with some soldiers.]
SIMMONS
You know, I hate to say it, Major, but if I had been in charge, none
of this would've ever happened. It seems to me you brought me down
here to figure out a way to retake the ship.
DAVIS
These individuals are threatening to blow up the X-303 unless their
demands are met.
SIMMONS
Yeah, what do they want?
DAVIS
You.
SIMMONS
Me?
DAVIS
They're also demanding we bring them one of your former associates,
Adrian Conrad.
SIMMONS
I hardly think of him as an associate. He's a Goa'uld, after all.
DAVIS
You helped him escaped when we had him trapped.
SIMMONS
I thought it would be best if we kept him in our custody.
DAVIS
Sure you did. The two of you made some kind of deal didn't you? We
know what the Goa'uld wants from you Colonel. He wants to escape.
What we don't know is what he offered you in return.
SIMMONS
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be able to help you.
DAVIS
Colonel, you either give me what I need and we make arrangements, or
we make a U-turn and I take you right back to your box.
SIMMONS
It seems to me that you're in a bit of a bind now aren't you?
Fortunately for you I am willing to board the X-303 in the interest
of saving lives. Of course I'm going to need a change of clothes.
Something nice.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[Smith enters.]
SMITH
The delivery is on its way. We're moving to Phase Two now.
SANDERSON
We've got a problem. Somebody recalibrated the ignition module. The
settings we have are all wrong.
JONAS
Don't look at me.
SANDERSON
We need the new settings. If we're off by as much as 1%, the engines
won't start and the module will burn out. We'll be stuck.
SMITH
(to Jonas)
Give me those settings now.
JONAS
I don't know what you're talking about.
SMITH
(taking a gun from Reynolds and pointing it at Jonas)
I'm not fooling around here.
MARTELL
(stepping in front of Smith)
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell are you doing? This wasn't part of
the plan.
SMITH
I'm improvising.
MARTELL
I was told no one would get hurt, that was the deal. So, quit waving
that gun around.
[Smith shoots Martell twice in the abdomen, killing him.]
SMITH
(to Jonas)
Now, where were we?
JONAS
All right.
[Jonas gets up and moves to a console.]
SMITH
No mistakes. If those engines don't start, both of you die.
EXT--SURFACE ABOVE SHIP, DAY
[Teal'c arrives and approaches the command tent.]
TEAL'C
Adrian Conrad has arrived.
DAVIS
Did he say anything to you?
TEAL'C
He was uncharacteristically silent for a Goa'uld. Have we received
word from Major Carter?
O'NEILL
No, not yet.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Carter is making slow progress with the cutting torch.]
SERGEANT
Sir, we're approaching deadline.
DAVIS
Radio the hijackers. We're sending in the prisoners.
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Carter is still working with the cutting torch.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
JONAS
There, it's done.
SANDERSON
Sublight engines are on line.
JONAS
This doesn't change anything. Even if you get this ship off the
ground, they are going to track you wherever you go.
SMITH
You're forgetting about the hyperdrive.
JONAS
Well, the hyperdrive is far from operational and that is something
that I cannot help you with.
[Adrian Conrad enters.]
CONRAD
(in the voice of his Goa'uld)
Perhaps not, but I can.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[Simmons enters.]
SIMMONS
Are we set?
JONES
All systems are go.
SIMMONS
Then release the docking clamps.
[She moves to comply as he sits in a command chair.]
INT--HANGAR BAY
[Huge docking clamps release from the sides of the ship.]
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
TECHNICAL SERGEANT
Major, they're preparing to take off.
DAVIS
Thank you.
O'NEILL
She is running out of time.
TEAL'C
Major Carter may still succeed in disabling the ship once they reach
orbit.
DAVIS
Teal'c, Deck Seven isn't pressurized. The airlock in that section is
still under construction. By the time they reach orbit, she'll be
dead.
[Teal'c and O'Neill look concerned.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
SIMMONS
(into radio)
Major Davis, this is Colonel Simmons. We'd like to leave now. Would
you be so kind as to retract the roof?
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
DAVIS
(into radio)
Colonel, you're going to have to wait a couple of minutes. We're
having problems with the hydraulics.
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
SIMMONS
Nice try, Davis. You have 30 seconds or we're going to detonate the
hyperdrive.

around her. She makes it into a vertical access shaft and shuts the

TECHNICAL SERGEANT
They're entering low earth orbit.
DAVIS
Now what?
TEAL'C
Does the ship not possess a docking bay capable of receiving the
X-302?
DAVIS
We don't have any ready to fly.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
We've got the death glider from Anubus.
[O'Neill and Teal'c begin to jog away.]
DAVIS
(raising his voice as they run away from him)
The radar system on the X-303 is still incomplete. Fly through the
lower bay. They'll never see you coming.
EXT--SPACE ABOVE EARTH
[The X-303 is in orbit about Earth.]
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
[Jonas, Donovan, and the SF's are being held in a different storage
room.]
DONOVAN
So that guy with the weird voice, he was an alien, wasn't he? You
might as well tell me. We're probably not going to survive this
anyway.
JONAS
We've been in tighter spots.
[The door opens and Simmons and Reynolds enter. Everyone stands.]
SIMMONS
Ms. Donovan, I-I-I just had to come down here and say hello. I'm a
big fan of your work.
DONOVAN
Terrific.
SIMMONS
And you, Sir, you must be Jonas Quinn, our new alien friend.
DONOVAN
You're an alien, too? I don't believe this.
JONAS
Where are you taking the ship?
SIMMONS
Oh, well, you don't worry about that, all right? You just sit tight
and you'll be released when everything's over.
JONAS
Do you really think it's wise to be working with a Goa'uld?
SIMMONS
He's fixing the hyperdrive. It's in his best interest. We'll deal
with him later.
JONAS
Yeah. What about Major Carter?
SIMMONS
Major Carter. Major Carter should've stayed with the group. But she
wanted to play the hero and she got herself killed.
[Simmons exits, shutting the door.]
INT--VERTICAL ACCESS TUBE
[Carter is climbing a ladder. She comes to a horizontal access tube and
enters it, moving on hands and knees then stopping and removing an
access panel.]
EXT--SPACE
[The death glider is moving along the underside of Prometheus.]
INT--HORIZONTAL ACCESS TUBE
[Carter pulls a cable and shorts out some circuits in the wall.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[Most of the film crew is there. Simmons arrives and takes a seat.
There is a beeping sound.]
SIMMONS
What is that?
JONES
The sublight engines are off line.
SIMMONS
What does that mean?
JONES
We still have full power, but I've got no control.
SANDERSON
(checking his monitor)
The circuit's been cut. Access tube, Deck Eight.
SIMMONS
It's Carter. I want you boys to get down there. And leave me your
gun.
[Sanderson leaves his gun on the console.]
JONES
Sir, we don't have enough altitude. If I don't get engine control
back soon, our orbit's gonna start to decay.
SIMMONS
(into radio)
Bridge to engine room, come in.
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
CONRAD
What is it?
SIMMONS
Are we gonna get into hyperdrive anytime soon here?
CONRAD
I'm working on it. The design is incredibly crude. It amazes me that
a race as backward as yours would even think of attempting
interstellar travel.
SIMMONS
Spare me the supervillain riff. We're on the clock, here.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[Sanderson is walking down the corridor. Carter comes out from hiding
and hits him. Smith and Reynolds come around the corner and point their
weapons at her.]
SMITH
(to Carter)
That's enough.
[Smith approaches Carter, aiming the zat at her. Suddenly he,
Sanderson, and Reynolds are zatted from behind. O'Neill and Teal'c come
walking down the corridor and Carter gives them a slight smile.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
JONES
Orbit's starting to decay.
CONRAD
(over radio)
Engine room to bridge, the hyperdrive is operational.
SIMMONS
Can we open up a window from low orbit?
JONES
Yes, Sir.
SIMMONS
Then do it. Use the coordinates the Goa'uld gave us.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c are moving down the corridor and hear the
hyperdrive engines start up.]
INT--X-303 STORAGE ROOM
DONOVAN
What is that?
JONAS
The hyperdrive.
DONOVAN
That's bad, isn't it?
EXT--SPACE
[A hyperspace portal opens and the X-303 enters it, disappearing.]
EXT--COMMAND TENT, DAY
TECHNICAL SERGEANT
Sir, we're getting a report from AF SATCOM. The X-303 just
disappeared from Earth orbit.
EXT--SPACE
[The ship is moving through hyperspace.]
INT--X-303 ENGINE ROOM
[O'Neill and the others search the room.]
O'NEILL
Clear.
(to Carter)
Can you shut down that hyperdrive?
CARTER
The computer's been reprogrammed, and I don't have the access codes.
O'NEILL
All right, let's find the others.
[They move slowly out of the room.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
SIMMONS
(into radio)
Smith, Sanderson come in. Come in dammit.
(to the others)
Wait here.
[As he begins to leave, Conrad attacks him and knocks him to the
ground. Conrad gets up.]
CONRAD
You're finished here.
[Conrad hits Jones then begins to choke Simmons. Simmons shoots him
multiple times with his pistol. Conrad's eyes glow. O'Neill, Carter,
and Teal'c enter the bridge to find Conrad and Jones down.]
TEAL'C
(checking on Jones)
This one is injured, but alive.
O'NEILL
(checking Conrad)
Toast.
TEAL'C
(to Jones, who is rousing)
Where are the hostages?
JONES
Supply room, Deck Four.
TEAL'C
(to O'Neill)
Supply room.
[O'Neill and Teal'c get up to leave and walk over the Carter, who is
guarding the entrance.]
O'NEILL
Carter, keep an eye on the bridge.
CARTER
(in warning)
Simmons.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I know.
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Teal'c are moving down the corridor. Simmons hits Teal'c
from behind then goes after O'Neill and they exchange blows. Simmons'
eyes glow indicating Conrad's Goa'uld is now inside him. Simmons stuns
O'Neill. Teal'c gets up and begins fighting Simmons. Simmons grabs a
large wrench and holds it over Teal'c.]
SIMMONS
I'm going to savor this moment.
EXT--SPACE
[The ship exits hyperspace.]
INT--X-303 CORRIDOR
[The ship vibrates and O'Neill hits Simmons. Then he goes to a control
panel and opens an external door just behind Simmons. Simmons is sucked
out, and O'Neill grabs Teal'c to prevent him from following. O'Neill
shuts the door, helps Teal'c up, and pats him on the chest before they
move away.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[The hostages, SG-1, and Jones are on the bridge.]
JONES
Where's the rest of my team?
O'NEILL
Just never you mind about the rest of your team.
CARTER
Sir, I have no idea where we are.
JONES
There should be a planet here.
CARTER
What planet?
JONES
Back when Colonel Maybourne was running our off world op, we found a
tablet written in the language of the Ancients. It described a large
cache of weapons and technology hidden in a secret location. Colonel
Simmons wanted it bad. Only problem was we couldn't translate the
coordinates.
TEAL'C
Therefore Colonel Simmons enlisted the aid of the Goa'uld.
JONES
After that, it was just a matter of waiting until we could get
transportation.
O'NEILL
Okay, let's go home.
CARTER
Well, Sir, it's possible when the hyperdrive was brought on line, no
one fully accounted for the instability of the naquadria.
O'NEILL
Well, who does?
CARTER
Well, what I'm saying is if I don't know where we are, I can't plot
a course for home.
DONOVAN
So, what do we do now?
EXT--SPACE
[The ship is moving slowly through normal space.]
INT--X-303 BRIDGE
[Jonas arrives from a corridor.]
JONAS
Gibson and Finney are checking the food supply, but it doesn't look
very good.
CARTER
Sir, based on the amount of time we spent in hyperspace, I'd
estimate we are at least 1,200 light years from Earth.
O'NEILL
How does that help us?
CARTER
Uh, it doesn't.
JONAS
(indicating the front view screen)
Colonel.
[An Asgard ship exits hyperspace right in front of Prometheus.]
CARTER
It's the Asgard.
[A hologram of Thor appears; he is sitting in his command chair.]
O'NEILL
(excited)
Thor, buddy, nice timing.
THOR
It has been some timing, O'Neill. I owe you all a debt of gratitude
for rescuing me from my Goa'uld captors.
O'NEILL
Ahh. Hey, I thought you were going for the new body?
THOR
I did.
O'NEILL
It's nice.
CARTER
So, how did you find us?
THOR
The Asgard monitor all hyperspace activity in the vicinity of Earth.
We have been tracking you since you left orbit.
O'NEILL
Excellent, can you help us out here?
THOR
In fact, it is we who need your help. The Asgard homeworld has been
overrun by the Replicators. We have need of both you and your ship.
[O'Neill looks surprised and concerned.]
