The Curse
TEASER
INT--ROOM FULL OF ARTIFACTS
[Dr. Jordan is sitting at his desk examining a beautiful Egyptian Isis
jar under a desk lamp. Steven approaches the desk.]
STEVEN
Dr. Jordan?
DR. JORDAN
Steven!
STEVEN
What are you doing here so late?
DR. JORDAN
Actually, I was just about to go down to the lab. We finally have a
chance to do a resonance scan on the Osiris jar.
STEVEN
Great. Great.
DR. JORDAN
Another couple of weeks, and we never would have known what was
inside.
STEVEN
Well, we could always break the seal, and take a look. Joking. Well,
half joking.
DR. JORDAN
The Egyptian government expects these items returned intact. If we
were in their place, I'm sure that we...
STEVEN
Sir, you watch. The scan will reveal that that unopened jar contains
the mummified heart of a 3000 year old pharaoh, and we're just
handing it over.
DR. JORDAN
I know. I know.
STEVEN
It's the find of a lifetime, Professor.
DR. JORDAN
Yes, yes it is. You coming?
STEVEN
Yeah, I just have a few things, I'll see ya down there.
DR. JORDAN
All right, then.
[Steven picks up a small gold Amulet from the artifacts. Studies it.
Sighs.]
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Daniel enters carrying an armful of folders and a mug of coffee.
O'Neill is seated at the table reading a magazine.]
DANIEL
Morning.
O'NEILL
Hey.
DANIEL
What's that?
O'NEILL
Um...it's...Teal'c's into this stuff. I don't get it. A great week
is in store for you...You'll be going on a trip--
DANIEL
Let me see that.
O'NEILL
Okay!
DANIEL
Oh, my God!
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
He's dead!
O'NEILL
Who?
DANIEL
My archeology professor.
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CEMETERY
[A funeral is in progress. There is a small group of people standing
around a coffin.]
STEVEN
Dr. David Jordan was a teacher, a celebrated author, a much revered
expert in the field of Archaeology. And yet, to the end, he remained
first and foremost, a student, guided by the simple desire to
discover, and understand.
[Daniel walks around behind the crowd.]
STEVEN
It's fitting, then, that a man, who dedicated his life...Who
dedicated his life to reviving the wonders and majesty of long-dead
civilizations, should himself gain a measure of immortality thru
that very accomplishment. I worked with Dr. Jordan for close to 15
years. He was like a father to me. Through his many successes, and
some of his bitter disappointments. I'll remember him always as a
dedicated archaeologist, a kind, and generous man, and a true
friend.
EXT--CEMETERY-END OF THE FUNERAL
[Cars are leaving. Daniel approaches the casket.]
STEVEN
The prodigal son returns!
DANIEL
Steven? Sarah.
SARAH
Daniel. It's good to see you.
DANIEL
Yeah. Despite the circumstances.
SARAH
I know. I can't believe he's gone.
DANIEL
So, what exactly happened? I mean...uh...the paper I read attributed
his death to the curse of Osiris.
STEVEN
According to the police...
(sighs)
there was a slow gas leak in the lab, and something must have caused
a spark, the whole place went up, he was killed instantly.
SARAH
We would have called you, but, nobody knew where to find you.
DANIEL
That's...that's okay.
SARAH
I'm glad you're here. So, how long has it been? Four years?
DANIEL
Five.
STEVEN
What have you been up to?
DANIEL
Uh...I've been busy.
SARAH
Really? I've looked for signs of you out on the fringes. There's
been no papers, no research projects. It's like you fell off the
face of the earth.
DANIEL
Yeah, it is a little like that, isn't it?
STEVEN
As I recall, the last time I saw you, you were giving a lecture to
an empty room.
DANIEL
Well, it was full when I started.
STEVEN
Well, maybe the world wasn't ready to hear that the pyramids were
built by aliens...or was it men from Atlantis?
SARAH
Steven, please!
DANIEL
Yes, Steven. Please.
STEVEN
Why did you come? You manage to stay away all this time. If you're
looking for closure, Daniel, I'd say you're a little late.
[Steven walks off.]
DANIEL
All ways a pleasure, Steven! So, are you doing anything, or...
SARAH
No, I'm all yours. I'm sorry. He's not usually like this. Last
couple of days have been really hard on him.
DANIEL
Steven? No, he's right. I should have come back sooner. I guess I
was afraid I wouldn't be welcome.
SARAH
Are you joking? Even after everything that happened, Dr. Jordan
never thought any less of you. You were his best student.
DANIEL
Yes, that became the laughing stock of the Archeological community.
SARAH
He kept hoping that you'd find proof. Something to shut everyone up.
DANIEL
No, he thought I was nuts.
SARAH
That's not true. Look, why do you think it's so hard for Steven to
see you here? He's always been in your shadow. Even after you left.
DANIEL
I hear his book's on the bestseller's list.
SARAH
I know. He's...getting a Porsche.
DANIEL
Ow!
SARAH
I know. Look, I have to admit. I thought you didn't come back
because of me.
DANIEL
No. No, that's not it.
SARAH
We could have ended it better than we did.
DANIEL
Maybe. The truth is, I got caught up in something...incredible.
SARAH
You found something, didn't you? Something that supports your
theory? Tell me. Come on.
DANIEL
I can't.
SARAH
Daniel!
DANIEL
Okay. Let's just say...that what the world knows about ancient Egypt
barely scratches the surface. The truth is more incredible than any
of us ever imagined.
SARAH
Now, that's the Daniel I remember. Come on, I want to show you
something.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond walks into the room. Teal'c, O'Neill and Carter are seated
around the table]
HAMMOND
As you were.
O'NEILL
So, General. Who's getting assigned to SG-1?
HAMMOND
No one. I've decided to reschedule your next mission until Dr.
Jackson returns. You're all long overdue for some personal leave.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir. But the leaving part has been the problem.
HAMMOND
Oh, I think you'll make it to the front door before we realize we
can't do without you. Dismissed.
O'NEILL
Thank you, Sir.
[Carter gets up and walks around the table.]
O'NEILL
Carter! You finally ready to take me up on that fishing trip?
CARTER
Er...actually, Sir, I have a few projects on the go.
O'NEILL
Come on. Are you really trying to tell me you'd rather work in a
dark, dank, dismal underground than sit on a dock with your feet
perched up, sippin' a cold one, and casting for that ever
elusive...crappie?
CARTER
Strange as it may sound, Sir, yes. Have a good time.
O'NEILL
To each his own! Her! I meant her...I think. So, Teal'c! This'll be
great! Just you and me. What do you say? Come on! The Loons! Don't
forget the loons!
INT--DR. JORDAN'S OFFICE.
[Sarah and Daniel walk in through the door.]
SARAH
I thought you might like to see what we were working on before the
accident.
DANIEL
Wow! This stuff is incredible!
SARAH
I only wish we had more time with them. The Egyptian government's
made a formal request for their return. We've been desperately
trying to learn as much as we can before the deadline.
[Daniel picks up a piece of paper and reads from it]
DANIEL
"Woe to all who this, my final resting place."
SARAH
Careful, now. All these artifacts are cursed. Well, that's what they
say.
DANIEL
Yeah, I...read something like that.
SARAH
Every member of the original expedition in 1931 died within a year
of the dig. Then the ship transporting these artifacts to American
sank off the coast of New Jersey six months later.
DANIEL
The Steward Expedition.
SARAH
Yes.
DANIEL
Those deaths were attributed to mold spores that were released from
the unsealed chamber.
SARAH
Mold spores aren't exactly front page material.
DANIEL
No, I guess not. Er...if these things went down with the ship in
1931, how'd they wind up here?
SARAH
They found the wreck a couple of months ago. All these artifacts
were still in their packing crates. They brought it up and they
shipped them to the museum. We just got them last week.
DANIEL
Well I can stay for a couple more days if you need help cataloging
these.
[Sarah starts to hunt around on the desk for something.]
DANIEL
What?
SARAH
Something's missing.
DANIEL
Are you sure?
SARAH
Positive. A gold amulet. Daniel, I've got to find it.
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill, Teal'c and Hammond are walking along quickly. Teal'c and
O'Neill are dressed in civies]
O'NEILL
Just so we're clear on this, Sir. It's going to be me, Teal'c, and
the great outdoors. That means no cell phones, no fax machines, not
another living soul for miles. We'll be unavailable, inaccessible.
HAMMOND
Incommunicado.
O'NEILL
Minnesota, Sir.
HAMMOND
I stand corrected.
[O'Neill and Teal'c step into the elevator. O'Neill keeps talking to
Hammond as the doors close]
O'NEILL
If there's an emergency back at the base, you better plan ahead and
tell me now. If Thor needs me, he's going to have to beam me up! If
the Tok'ra, forget it!
EXT--MUSEUM
INT--ARCHIVE BASEMENT
[Curator and Daniel walk in and around shelves full of labelled
artifacts]
CURATOR
Excuse the state of things. Budget cuts. I'm straightening the mess
out, but these things take time.
DANIEL
Oh, I understand.
CURATOR
What am I looking for?
DANIEL
An artifact that went missing from the Steward Expedition.
CURATOR
The Isis jar.
DANIEL
Er...No, actually, I'm...uh...referring to a...a gold amulet with a
little ebony...Um...uh...uh, it's listed as item 14C.
CURATOR
That was sent up to Dr. Jordan along with the rest of the artifacts.
DANIEL
You're sure?
CURATOR
I sent it myself. I can show you the paperwork.
DANIEL
No, um...what's this...uh...Isis jar you were talking about?
CURATOR
I'll show you. The damn crate was mislabeled when it came in. I only
found it a couple days ago.
DANIEL
Uh...this one?
[Daniel lifts an Isis jar down from a high shelf]
CURATOR
Oh, yeah, yeah. Never seen those symbols before, have you?
DANIEL
Uh, yes. I'm going to need to do a translation.
CURATOR
Well, if ya need me, I'll be in the back cataloging the Polynesian
death masks.
INT--SGC, CARTER'S OFFICE
[Carter and Siler are working on a Harley Davidson motorcycle. Phone
rings. Carter answers the phone.]
CARTER
Carter.
DANIEL
Sam, it's me.
CARTER
Hang on a sec. Thanks for your help, Sergeant.
SILER
Yeah, no sweat, Major.
[Siler leaves the office.]
CARTER
Where are you?
INT--BASEMENT ARCHIVE AT THE MUSEUM
DANIEL
I'm still in Chicago. I'm in the basement of a museum looking at
what appears to be an Egyptian burial jar...
CARTER
Okay?
DANIEL
Which may not be out of the ordinary in a museum, granted, but
there's something else beside the usual hieroglyphs. There's a
second set of markings. They're Goa'uld symbols.
EXT--A LAKE
[O'Neill is sitting fishing. Teal'c is standing next to him staring at
a rod.]
TEAL'C
There appears to be no fish here, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
T, it's not about the actual fish themselves. The fish are not
important in this context, it's about fishing! The act of fishing.
TEAL'C
I see.
[Sound of a cell phone ringing. O'Neill looks around.]
O'NEILL
You didn't!
TEAL'C
By request of General Hammond.
[O'Neill reaches around into a bag behind him and picks out the phone.
He answers it.]
O'NEILL
What? Yes, Daniel. He's right here! Please hold.
[O'Neill hands the phone to Teal'c]
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson...We have caught nothing. We are fishing.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE IN THE SGC
DANIEL
Right. Um, listen, I need a little help with a translation. I've got
a line here that reads "Hako kra terak shree."
TEAL'C
Banished to oblivion.
DANIEL
Right. Okay, er...thank you.
EXT--THE LAKE
TEAL'C
If you require assistance, I would be more than happy to return to
the SGC.
DANIEL
No, thanks. I think I can take it from here.
TEAL'C
Are you certain?
O'NEILL
Gimme that!
[O'Neill takes the phone from Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Goodbye, Daniel!
DANIEL
Uh...no, wait, wa...
[O'Neill ends the call. He takes the battery from the phone and throws
it over his shoulder. He hands the phone back to Teal'c. Teal'c uses it
to splat a bug on his neck.]
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel is pacing, holding a scroll. Hammond and Carter are listening]
DANIEL
During the ritual of mummification, the ancient Egyptians would
remove the vital organs of the deceased and place them in jars,
which would then be buried with the sarcophagus so that they could
be accessed in the after life.
HAMMOND
Is that what we're looking at here?
DANIEL
That's what I thought at first, but according to the record of the
original expedition, no sarcophagus was found. The Hieroglyphs
identify the jar as belonging to Isis, who was the Egyptian Mother
Goddess.
CARTER
A Goa'uld?
DANIEL
That's possible. See, Isis was a consort of Osiris, supposedly the
first Pharaoh of Egypt. According to legend, he was placed in a
magic box, and dumped into the Nile by his brother Seth.
HAMMOND
Now, that name I recognize.
DANIEL
The Goa'uld symbols indicate that Isis and Osiris suffered some sort
of punishment, or...banishment.
CARTER
Where to?
DANIEL
I have no idea.
HAMMOND
Major, I want the contents analyzed.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
DANIEL
Uh, now I'd be careful if I were you. For all we know, it could be
some sort of Goa'uld bobby- trap left behind by Osiris as a means of
revenge. Also, it's...it's cursed, so...
CARTER
Thanks for the warning.
[Carter leaves the office.]
DANIEL
General, there's something else. The inventory of the Steward
Expedition lists two jars.
HAMMOND
Can you find the other one?
DANIEL
Well, I can try. I was going to head back to Chicago tonight.
EXT--MUSEUM AT NIGHT
[Daniel enters a dark room.]
DANIEL
Hello? Hello?
[Daniel tries the light switch. Nothing. He finds a flashlight. sound
of someone passing. Daniel turns the flashlight on Steven.]
STEVEN
Do you mind?
DANIEL
What are you doing here?
STEVEN
What are you doing here?
DANIEL
I asked first.
STEVEN
I work here, Daniel. Remember? I'm looking for the breaker box,
whereever the damn thing is!
DANIEL
Uh...right! Um...I had a few questions for the curator.
STEVEN
I don't think she's here. The lights were out when I came in. What
did you want to ask her about?
DANIEL
I needed some information about items from the Steward Expedition.
There's something missing.
STEVEN
There's nothing missing.
DANIEL
Er...A canapic jar with some hieroglyphs, and some unusual markings.
STEVEN
The Osiris jar.
DANIEL
Yes.
STEVEN
Destroyed in the explosion.
DANIEL
You're sure about that?
STEVEN
Yes, positive.
DANIEL
OK. Well, what about this gold amulet?
STEVEN
Daniel, if you're looking to get back together with Sarah, that's
your business, I really couldn't care less, but I do have a problem
with you coming here and involving your self in my work!
DANIEL
Don't you mean Dr. Jordan's work?
STEVEN
No! My work! Sarah and I were Dr. Jordan's assistants. You haven't
been involved since you walked out on him.
DANIEL
I didn't walk out on him. I was...trying to protect him.
STEVEN
You mean you distanced yourself in order to spare him the
embarrassment of being associated with you. Daniel, you really
should not have come back.
[Daniel find the breaker and switches on all the lights.]
DANIEL
Look, I don't want to get into this with you right now, but you need
my help.
STEVEN
Why? Do you think there might aliens involved.
[The elevator rises. The Curator is dead inside.]
STEVEN
Oh, God!
INT--SGC, CARTER'S LAB
[Hammond and Carter are watching a computer scan of the Isis jar.]
CARTER
Preliminary analysis of the jar indicates the exterior is ordinary
ceramic. It also appears as if the seal has been damaged.
HAMMOND
Any indication of what might be inside?
CARTER
Well, hopefully a computer-enhanced MRI will tell us something.
HAMMOND
Is that what I think it is?
[On the computer screen is the scan of the inside of the jar. Scan
reveals a Goa'uld symbiote.]
CARTER
Yes, Sir. That's Goa'uld symbiote.
INT--DR. JORDAN'S OFFICE
[Daniel and Sarah are reading some papers]
DANIEL
The police said the museum curator suffered a fatal blunt trauma to
the skull.
SARAH
They don't think that you had anyth...
DANIEL
No, they don't think that, but, of course, Steven didn't do anything
to dissuade them from suspecting me, but fortunately, I know a
few...people. Anyway, they found some bricks at the bottom of the
freight elevator shaft, and they think that they came from the wall
above...A freak accident.
SARAH
You know the papers are saying the Curse of the Mummy strikes again.
DANIEL
You have any pictures of the Osiris jar? The one that was destroyed
in the explosion?
SARAH
Yeah, here.
DANIEL
I can't make out the inscription around the collar.
SARAH
We were unable to identify the symbols, but Dr. Jordan copied them
in his notebook. Those markings are unlike anything we've ever seen
before. They're not Egyptian.
DANIEL
No, they're not Egyptian.
SARAH
So what are they?
DANIEL
What are they?
SARAH
You know! How?
DANIEL
Let's just say I can't really go into it right now, but this is
really important. Did Dr. Jordan do any kind of preliminary tests on
the jar?
SARAH
Not that I know of, but he kept all his lab results on the computer.
INT--SGC, LAB
[Hammond is present. Carter and Fraiser are opening the Isis jar inside
a quarantine cubicle. Fraiser brings a dead symbiote out of the jar
with forceps]
FRAISER
It's dead. We can relax.
[Fraiser cuts open the symbiote.]
FRAISER
Do we know how long it's been inside the jar?
CARTER
According to Daniel, several thousand years.
FRAISER
Well, it's perfectly preserved. It could have died yesterday.
INT--DR. JORDAN'S OFFICE
[Daniel and Sarah looking at Dr. Jordan's computer.]
SARAH
Something's wrong.
DANIEL
What?
SARAH
Dr. Jordan's files are gone. Everything's been wiped clean.
Including his e-mail account.
DANIEL
Do you keep backups?
SARAH
Yeah, they're not here.
DANIEL
What are you doing?
SARAH
The system marks file spaces being deleted as Tombstone. At regular
intervals it scours the database looking for tombstone values and
marks them as being ready to be overridden. There's usually a window
of about 30 days before that happens, so I might be able to retrieve
the files before the tombstone values replicate through the network.
Got something! The Professor received one message on the night he
died. Well, I'm guessing he never got around to reading it.
DANIEL
That's the results of carbon dating analysis done on the ebony
portion of item 14C.
SARAH
The missing gold amulet.
SARAH
Oh, my God. Daniel. It's over 10,000 years old! This means you were
right all along.
DANIEL
Yeah, I know.
SARAH
The Egyptian civilization must be thousands of years older that
we've ever assumed!
DANIEL
Sarah, you can't...tell anyone about this.
SARAH
What are you talking about? This is exactly the evidence you've been
looking for! This completely validates your theories!
DANIEL
Look, all we've got are the results of one carbon dating on a
missing artifact.
SARAH
So, we can contact the technician who preformed the analysis.
DANIEL
What?
SARAH
Dr. Jordan wasn't the only one to get these results. Steven.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Fraiser is giving a presentation to Carter and Hammond.]
FRAISER
By all right, the Goa'uld symbiote should be a dried-up, desiccated
husk, but instead, it's in perfect condition. Now, at first, we
thought it had been preserved, like a specimen in formaldehyde, but
now, we are not so sure.
HAMMOND
What do you mean?
CARTER
Well, Sir. The outside of the jar is ceramic. The inside is a
technologically advanced containment vessel. There's a tiny naquada
power source that's designed to emit a low-level electrical charge.
HAMMOND
Why?
CARTER
Well, we can't be certain yet, Sir, but I would guess the jar is
some sort of stasis chamber.
FRAISER
From what we've been able to gather, Sir, we think that the symbiote
was alive when it was placed inside.
HAMMOND
Why would it allow itself to be removed from its host and placed in
stasis?
CARTER
I don't believe it had a choice, Sir.
FRAISER
You see, the liquid inside the jar seems to have sedative
properties. Now if it's maintained at the proper temperatures, if it
is provided with sufficient electrical charge, it could probably
keep the symbiote alive indefinitely.
HAMMOND
Then why is it dead?
CARTER
The seal was broken, presumably during transport.
HAMMOND
Major, if what you're saying is true, and the second jar survived
the trip unscathed...
CARTER
Yes, Sir! There could be a Goa'uld out there.
EXT--MUSEUM
INT--BASEMENT ARCHIVES
[Daniel is studying more artifacts.]
SARAH
Daniel? There you are! I've been looking all over for you!
DANIEL
Yeah, I'm just doing a little extra research.
SARAH
I went by Steven's place, and he's gone. He's packed up everything
and left.
DANIEL
I know.
SARAH
You think he stole the amulet, don't you?
DANIEL
Yes.
SARAH
To stop your theories from being proven correct?
DANIEL
It's possible. Anyway, I have to find him.
SARAH
Well, I'll come with you.
DANIEL
No...No, it's...too dangerous.
SARAH
We're talking about Steven here.
DANIEL
Sarah, there have been three deaths already.
SARAH
Three?
DANIEL
They found the body of the technician that did the carbon dating on
the amulet.
SARAH
Daniel, I know Steven. He may be capable of a lot of things, but
he's no murderer.
DANIEL
Well, you might not know him as well as you think you do...at
least...not anymore.
SARAH
What's that supposed to mean? Oh, let me guess...you can't explain,
right?
DANIEL
Sarah...
SARAH
Well, what do you expect, Daniel? You show up after five years, but
you can't say where you've been! You've got this mysterious ability
to be able to read this ancient language nobody's ever seen before,
but you can't explain how! Then, when we finally find the evidence
to vindicate you to the entire archeological community. you want to
cover it up! What is going on? This is me, Daniel.
DANIEL
I know.
SARAH
Then, why can't you trust me? What have you been doing for the past
five years?
DANIEL
I want to tell you, Sarah. Really I do, believe me. I wish you could
see some of the things I've seen. But the world is not ready to
know. Not yet.
SARAH
I'm not asking you to tell the world. I'm asking you to tell me.
This is my life's work, too, Daniel. So, you're working for the
government, what? Daniel!
DANIEL
I'm sorry!
SARAH
You're just going to disappear again, aren't you?
DANIEL
Yes.
SARAH
I think Steven was right. You never should have come back.
INT--SGC, DANIEL'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
So you believe this Steven Rayner has been taken over by a Goa'uld?
DANIEL
Well, it makes sense.
CARTER
So how do we find him?
DANIEL
Right now, this is our only lead. It's the amulet that was stolen
from Dr. Jordan's office. Now, by Earth standards, it's a priceless
relic, but I'm assuming that a Goa'uld isn't interested in it's
monetary value, so...
CARTER
Then why take it?
DANIEL
That's a good question. It's a pretty standard representation of
Osiris. He's carrying a crook and flail, which are the septers of
kingship, and in the center is an aunk, which represents
immortality.
HAMMOND
Could it be some sort of Goa'uld device.
DANIEL
It's possible.
CARTER
That might explain why it was the only item taken.
DANIEL
Well, I checked the other artifacts for any indication of naquada,
which is usually a sure sign of Goa'uld technology, and I came up
empty.
HAMMOND
Assuming this Goa'uld is Osiris, what does he want?
DANIEL
He's been out of the loop a long time, He doesn't know what happened
to Seth or Ra. He could be looking for the Isis jar.
CARTER
Or a way off the planet.
HAMMOND
I've already put the base on alert.
INT--SGC LAB
FRAISER
I managed to synthesize the liquid from the jar so on its own it
should act as a powerful sedative. One dart should be more than
enough to knock out an adult Goa'uld.
CARTER
Do we really want this thing alive?
DANIEL
Well, even though it's been in stasis for that last several thousand
years, it could still be a valueable source of information.
HAMMOND
I want you to hold that option in reserve. Your first priority is to
stop the Goa'uld with minimum risk to yourselves.
[Sound of phone ringing. Fraiser answers.]
FRAISER
Frasier. Yes, He's right here.
[Fraiser hands phone to Hammond.]
FRAISER
Sir?
HAMMOND
Hammond. Yes. All right, thank you.
[Hammond hangs up the phone.]
HAMMOND
We got a lead on Steven Rayner. He boarded a flight to Cairo four
hours ago.
DANIEL
He could be headed back to the temple in Egypt where the jars were
first discovered. If we move fast, we could head him off, Sir.
HAMMOND
I can alert the Egyptian authorities. This needs to be a low-profile
operation. Dr. Frasier will accompany you.
EXT--DESERT
[A Jeep comes over the horizon. Daniel, Carter and Fraiser are having a
bumpy ride. Daniel is driving.]
FRAISER
I think I know why this place doesn't get any tourists.
CARTER
According to the GPS, we've still got another ten miles.
INT--TOMB
[Steven is looking around. He takes the amulet and places it in a slot
on the wall. The wall opens to reveal a red light and a ribbon device.
Steven takes it and slides it on.]
EXT--DESERT
[Daniel, Carter and Fraiser arrive outside the tomb. Armed, they go
inside cautiously.]
INT--TOMB
[Steven is lying on the floor inside.]
DANIEL
It's Steven!
CARTER
I'm not sensing anything. He's not Goa'uld.
[Fraiser checks Steven. He is alive.]
DANIEL
Steven.
FRAISER
He's bleeding internally.
DANIEL
Steven, it's me.
STEVEN
Daniel?
DANIEL
What happened?
STEVEN
I took the amulet. It's over 10,000 years old. You...were right all
along. I'm sorry. Ahhh!
FRAISER
Just take it easy, okay? I need you to hold still.
DANIEL
(to Steven)
It's okay! She's a friend. What about the jar?
STEVEN
Huh?
DANIEL
The Osiris jar. Did you open it?
STEVEN
No.
DANIEL
Why did you come here?
STEVEN
I figured out the amulet was a key. There's a hidden chamber. I
wanted to make the discovery.
FRAISER
Daniel, we have to get him out of here!
DANIEL
Steven, who did this to you?
[Sarah enters. She's dressed in white. Her voice is Goa'uld.]
SARAH/OSIRIS
I did!
[Daniel aims the gun at Osiris.]
DANIEL
Sarah?
[Sarah ribbons Carter and Fraiser against the wall. Daniel fires. He
misses. As he reloads, Osiris walks forward and grabs him around the
throat.]
OSIRIS
Daniel Jackson. You seem to know much of the Goa'uld, much more than
any other human I have more than any other human I have encountered
since my awakening. Now tell me, where is the Stargate?
DANIEL
I don't know what you're talking about.
OSIRIS
Insolence.
[Osiris throws Daniel down against the floor.]
OSIRIS
This temple was once filled with worshippers.
DANIEL
Yeah? Well, times have changed.
OSIRIS
So I have observed. Where is my brother, Setesh?
DANIEL
Ah, you mean Seth. Uh...He's dead. Yeah, we killed him.
OSIRIS
You lie!
DANIEL
No! No, we also killed Ra, and Hathor, and uh...who else? Ah, Sokar!
OSIRIS
Then you have done me a great favour. I will rule without
opposition.
DANIEL
No! No, you won't rule at all. You see, we don't worship false gods
anymore.
OSIRIS
You have come far, it is true. But you are still weak. Even though
you are torn between your desire to kill me, and your concern for my
host, she who freed me from my long sleep. What do you know of my
queen?
DANIEL
Um...She was trapped, like you. We have the jar.
OSIRIS
Where is it?
DANIEL
I'm not going to tell you.
OSIRIS
You are mistaken.
[Osiris puts her ribbon device above Daniel's head and starts to ribbon
him. In pain, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dart.]
OSIRIS
Where is my queen? Tell me!
[Daniel takes the dart, uncaps it and sticks it in Osiris' leg. Osiris
stops the ribbon device.]
OSIRIS
What is this? What have you done?
[Osiris takes the dark from her leg.]
OSIRIS
You will pay for this impudence!
[Osiris opens the same slot Steven found and activates something. The
sand above the tomb starts to clear to reveal a pyramid Goa'uld ship.]
OSIRIS
Make no mistake, Osiris will return, and the rivers of the earth
will run red with blood.
[Osiris presses the top of the ribbon device. Carter comes round and
reaches for her gun. The ring transport rings come down. Carter fires.
The bullets bounce off the rings. Osiris vanishes. Carter goes to
Daniel who is crouched on the ground in obvious pain.]
CARTER
You all right?
DANIEL
Oh, yeah! Yeah! I think I'm...getting used to that thing!
FRAISER
Where's Osiris?
CARTER
Gone.
DANIEL
Steven?
FRAISER
If we get him out of here right now, I think he'll make it.
DANIEL
I guess we'd better make up a story to tell him.
[The ship leaves Earth.]
