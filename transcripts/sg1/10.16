EXT--TRUST WAREHOUSE, DAY
[Vala escapes from a burning warehouse.]
INT--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE
[Vala is tied to a chair.]
VALA
What exactly do you want from me?
ATHENA
The code. To an Ancient tablet.
VALA
Do I know you?
ATHENA
You did. A long time ago.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
DANIEL
(referring to pages in an Ancient book)
Athena, Greek goddess of war. Qetesh double-crossed her when they
partnered up to search for the Clava Thessara Infinitas. Now,
according to legend, it would allow he who possesses it entry to a
vast storehouse of riches hidden away by the Ancients prior to their
ascension.

TEASER
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1 minus Carter are sitting at the table with Landry. Daniel has a
briefing folder in front of him.]
DANIEL
The Clava Thessara Infinitas. The Key to Infinite Treasure. A cache
of Ancient wealth and weapons.
MITCHELL
You do realize the last cache of Ancient stuff we picked up is what
got us in trouble with the Ori in the first place.
DANIEL
So what? Just leave it out there for someone else to find?
TEAL'C
I thought you believed the Clava Thessara Infinitas to be a hoax,
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
I did, yes, but the research Athena did is actually quite
compelling. Now, after cross referencing her research and our
cartouche, I was able to generate a gate address.
MITCHELL
Possible location of the treasure.
DANIEL
I'm not sure, but we sent a MALP to P4M-328, and the images it sent
back are particularly interesting.
[He pulls some pictures from the briefing folder.]
DANIEL
Now, the hieroglyphs on the wall are all out of order and from
various different dynasties. At first glance, they don't make any
sense.
VALA
(reaching for the pictures)
It's a code!
[Daniel hands the images to Landry after pushing her hand away.]
LANDRY
Sounds like it's worth checking out. Go ahead.
TEAL'C
Should we not wait until Colonel Carter returns from Washington?
LANDRY
She's still there briefing the President on the scenario that played
out in the alternate reality where the Stargate was made public.
MITCHELL
Well that's taking longer than it was supposed to.
DANIEL
It could be a good way to examine what might happen here.
LANDRY
Sounds like President Hayes is having a hard time just getting past
the fact that he wasn't President.
[Landry smiles and stands.]
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM, P4M-328
[SG-1 minus Carter arrive through the gate. The MALP is sitting dormant
off to the side. The room is dark, so everyone turns on their
flashlights.]
DANIEL
Well, I'm gonna set up my camera and take some high-res stills of
these glyphs.
[Daniel walks over to one of the walls with hieroglyph panels as the
others check out the immediate area.]
MITCHELL
(to Vala)
Give Ansel Adams there a hand. Teal'c and I'll check out the
perimeter.
VALA
Right. Well, I'm sure that's a very witty popular culture reference,
but I--
DANIEL
He's a photographer best known for his black and white images of
California's Yosemite Valley.
VALA
(falsely, calling after Mitchell)
Oh! Ha, ha. Good one!
[Mitchell and Teal'c have stepped into a contemporary-looking hallway
with display cases full of artifacts. The structure looks like modern
Earth.]
MITCHELL
Is it me, or did we just step into an architectural time machine?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
MITCHELL
(examining it with his flashlight)
This is a display case. Hey, can you read that?
[He shines his flashlight on a pedestal with writing on it. Teal'c
walks over to it.]
TEAL'C
Hmm. I do not recognize the language.
MITCHELL
Well, we ain't in a pyramid. We're in a museum.
TEAL'C
(looking down the hallway)
Colonel Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Yeah.
TEAL'C
Do you hear music?
MITCHELL
No... Yes.
[There is a faint rhythmic sound.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[The hall has high ceilings and is set up for a party, with roped-off
exhibits as well as some tables. There is a cocktail reception going
on. People are dressed in formal clothing and what appear to be
uniforms of some sort. There is music playing. A young woman pulls a
young man away from the crowd and to the side of the room. Behind a
divider, Mitchell and Teal'c look on.]
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM, P4M-328
[Mitchell and Teal'c come jogging in to the room; Daniel and Vala are
taking photos.]
MITCHELL
Pack it up!
DANIEL
What?
MITCHELL
Pulling the plug.
VALA
But we haven't even got started yet.
TEAL'C
This is not a tomb.
MITCHELL
It's a museum!
DANIEL
Well that would explain why the hieroglyphs are all jumbled.
MITCHELL
And there's a pretty big party going on next door, so...
[He gestures with his hands for everyone to get ready to go.]
DANIEL
Right!
[Daniel starts packing up.]
VALA
(intrigued)
What kind of party?
[Mitchell is at the DHD, checking it as he speaks. Vala takes pictures
of Mitchell with a small digital camera. She tilts it at all angles.]
MITCHELL
The kind we do not invite ourselves to. This is a first contact
situation. When a civilization reaches a certain level of
development, we don't do those in person. We send the MALP to make
contact and, if they are into the idea of extra-terrestrial
visitors, then we get to go to the party, not before. Basic
protocol.
(reacting to Vala's picture taking)
Cut that out.
VALA
What's the harm. We're already here. We could go and just not tell
them we're alien.
MITCHELL
It's not gonna happen.
VALA
(looking at her camera review screen)
That wasn't a good one.
MITCHELL
(to everyone)
Clear out.
[They move out of the splash zone of the gate. Mitchell starts pushing
glyphs on the DHD, but nothing happens. One of the glyphs comes loose
in his hand. It is merely plastic. He shows it to Daniel then tosses it
to the floor. He bends down to the base of the DHD and tilts it. The
plastic glyphs fall to the floor. The DHD is clearly a prop, not real.]
MITCHELL
Okay, that's not good.
[They four exchange amazed looks.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
[The team is gathered around the false DHD.]
MITCHELL
If they found a gate, they most likely found a DHD, no?
DANIEL
We didn't.
MITCHELL
Well they knew enough to build a pretty convincing replica, so they
must have one lying around here somewhere, no?
DANIEL
No, they could have just fabricated it from drawings.
TEAL'C
If indeed they did possess an authentic DHD, would they not display
it near the authentic gate?
MITCHELL
Good point. Good point.
DANIEL
We're stuck.
VALA
No we're not!
[They all look at her.]
VALA
Well, when we fail to make the scheduled check-in, General Landry
will dial in, at which point we'll ask him to send a naquadah
generator and a laptop with a dialing program and that's that!
DANIEL
We knew that! I-I-I thought that when I said that we're stuck, that
you would know that I meant "until then."
VALA
Well, then you should say what you mean.
DANIEL
I don't think you want me to start doing that.
VALA
I don't think you want to start thinking what I think.
DANIEL
Anywho! FYI, we don't need the dialing computer. Worst case
scenario, we can always dial the gate manually.
MITCHELL
Right, kick it rotary style. We still need a power source. What
about the MALP?
DANIEL
No.
MITCHELL
Seaweed.
DANIEL
Don't go there.
MITCHELL
Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.
DANIEL
(checking his watch)
So, therefore, next check-in is in just under six hours.
VALA
Good. Muscles, that means that we have time to go to the party.
[She starts to walk away until Mitchell's voice stops her.]
MITCHELL
No, it does not! It means we stay here out of sight and remain as
inconspicuous as possible. With a bit of luck, the people on this
planet will never even know we were here.
[The couple who had left the party before arrive in the gate room and
are now just a few feet away from the team. They begin kissing
intensely.]
WOMAN
(pushing him away for a moment)
Don't tell Sylvana. She is like a sister to me.
HEREN
Never.
[The resume kissing. They stop and begin to walk toward the gate, where
they finally see the team. Mitchell waves casually.]
MITCHELL
Hi. There's nothing to be alarmed about. We um--
[The woman begins screaming then turns and runs out of the room, the
man following her. She is still screaming. Teal'c and Mitchell head out
after them, and Vala tries to follow, but Daniel holds her back.]
VALA
How come they get to go?
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[The party continues. The couple comes running in, the woman still
screaming. They run to the crowd, stop, and turn. She stops screaming.
Mitchell and Teal'c run in and see the large crowd of people, then stop
short. The people stare at them in silence.]
MITCHELL
Hi.
SYLVANA
(screaming)
They're rebels!
[Some of the men are security and reach for weapons, both pistols and
automatic rifles. Mitchell holds out his arm and starts to withdraw
back toward the hallway.]
MITCHELL
Whoa, no! No! No!
[He and Teal'c turn to run. The security men start fire at them. The
civilians start screaming and scattering. Mitchell and Teal'c take
cover behind some large pillars. At least four men continue firing. The
crowd retreats, followed by the shooters. As one shooter is leaving,
his bullets hit a large display case, setting off the museum alarms.
This causes metal grated doors to drop into place, sealing off the
room. Some of the civilians and security personnel are trapped within
the room. One shooter comes around behind Teal'c and is about to shoot
him. Mitchell shoots the man once in the lower leg, disabling him.
Teal'c turns at the shot and checks the injured guard. Mitchell goes
into the hall, seeing one man trying to reload. He aims his P-90 at the
man.]
MITCHELL
Drop the weapon and kick it over.
[Teal'c jogs in, aiming his P-90 and the rifle belonging to the man
Mitchell just shot.]
MITCHELL
I'm not gonna ask twice.
[The man puts his gun on the floor and slides it over. A security guard
watches what is going on from the balcony above the hall. He pulls his
small handgun, then sneaks away.]
MITCHELL
(to a man dressed formally)
Get on the ground!
(to the remaining civilians)
That goes for everybody!
[The people come cautiously forward to sit on the floor. Mitchell walks
around and notices someone hiding under the buffet table.]
MITCHELL
You two, under the table!
[It is the couple who first discovered SG-1. She starts screaming
again.]
MITCHELL
Stop screaming already and get out here!
[The pair come out and lie down on the floor.]
MITCHELL
(to everyone)
All right! Now, we're not gonna hurt anyone, but I need you to stay
calm, quiet, and on the ground, until we figure this out!
[Daniel and Vala come running in.]
DANIEL
What...the hell happened?!
MITCHELL
We had a little misunderstanding.
DANIEL
Yeah, I can see that!
VALA
Might have been easier to just pose as party guests.
MITCHELL
They thought we were rebels.
DANIEL
What does that mean?
MITCHELL
I don't know; I didn't get a chance to ask a lot of questions.
VALA
Why are all the outer doors sealed off?
MITCHELL
One of their guys shot that case. He must have triggered a lockdown.
And for the moment, it would be good if it stayed that way.
DANIEL
Wonderful.
MITCHELL
See what you can do.
VALA
Okay.
[Vala walks away. The formally dressed man stands up.]
CHANCELLOR
Excuse me.
[Mitchell, Daniel, and Teal'c all aim their guns at him.]
CHANCELLOR
Don't shoot!
MITCHELL
Then don't stand!
[He remains standing but holds his hands up for a moment.]
CHANCELLOR
Please! Uh, let all these other people go. I'm the one that you
want.
MITCHELL
No offense, buddy, but you're not.
[Vala has found a circuit box and opened it.]
CHANCELLOR
Well, the Viceroy and all the other Chancellors were able to escape.
I'm all that's left. Keep me; free the others.
MITCHELL
Listen--
CHANCELLOR
Look, I know you believe that bringing us to our knees will make you
heroes, that the people will follow your lead and rise up against
us, but-- but harming innocent civilians will get you nowhere!
[While he speaks, Vala connects a tablet laptop computer to the circuit
box. She smiles when it lights up with a schematic of the museum,
showing door locations and status.]
DANIEL
Ah, I know you're gonna find this hard to believe, but we're not
rebels. Ah, we're explorers.
CHANCELLOR
What?
DANIEL
You see, we're from another planet. Actually, a whole other star
system, really.
CHANCELLOR
(patronizing)
Wha-wha-wha wait! Another planet?
DANIEL
You see, you have a large ring back there in an exhibit. It's called
a Stargate, and it's an interplanetary transporter.
[As he speaks, a man on the floor listens with great interest.]
CHANCELLOR
I understand. You don't want to make your demands to me. But please,
I implore you, you are not gonna get what you want by hurting
people!
[A voice comes over a radio.]
LOURDES
(over radio)
This is Lourdes Maylay. I'm a member of the council security detail,
and I'd like to talk to whoever is in charge.
[A security man on the ground pulls his radio from his belt and hands
it to Daniel.]
DANIEL
(to Chancellor)
Could you just...?
[He gestures for Chancellor to get back on the floor. The Chancellor
complies.]
DANIEL
(into radio)
Hello?
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
[A special operations squad is set up outside the museum with tanks and
large torch-lights aimed at the building.]
LOURDES
(into radio)
We have a senior negotiator on his way. I'd just like to let you
know we're going to do everything in our power to get you what you
need.
[As he speaks, men equipped in riot-type gear deploy into position.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
We don't need anything.
LOURDES
(over radio)
I'm sorry?
DANIEL
(into radio)
Look, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. You see, we're not
rebels.
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
LOURDES
(into radio)
Then release the hostages.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(to his teammates)
That's not a bad idea.
VALA
It's a terrible idea.
DANIEL
(turning toward Vala, irritated)
Why?
VALA
It doesn't matter what we say to them. They think we're rebels. We
shot a security guard. We took hostages. If we let those people go,
they're gonna come in here and kill us.
MITCHELL
The lady's making a lot of sense.
DANIEL
(restraining himself from yelling)
This is not how you make first contact with people!
MITCHELL
Not intentionally, no. But all we gotta do is stall for
five-and-a-half hours 'til Landry dials in. Then we bolt, and those
people can believe what they wanna believe.
VALA
And no one gets hurt.
TEAL'C
I too believe that to be the best course of action.
VALA
(nodding)
Uh hmm.
DANIEL
(to all three of them)
Okay, do you understand how dangerous this could be? This is an
alien culture of which we have no knowledge. We don't know how
they're gonna handle a situation like this. We don't know whether
they're gonna wait six hours. Once we start posing as kidnappers,
there's no turning back. And if we get captured, we are hooped!!
MITCHELL
Jackson! I hear what you're sayin'...but I don't think we have a
choice. As far as I can see, these people are not gonna be open to
the idea that we are peaceful aliens out on a jolly jaunt just to
look around.
[Daniel sighs but gives in.]
DANIEL
(into radio)
I can't free them quite yet.
LOURDES
(over radio)
If this is some kind of mistake, I suggest you release them, now.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Listen, one of your people has been seriously injured. I suggest you
send in medical personnel to take him out of here.
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
LOURDES
You've sealed off the museum. How do you expect us to get in?
INT--ROOM IN MUSEUM
[The government forces are torching through the last of a series of
bars in the metal grating so there is a space large enough for them to
enter the museum. Teal'c stands guard. Once the last bar is removed,
Teal'c ushers in two medics with a stretcher and shows them down the
hall to where the injured man is. Daniel and Vala are waiting there.
The injured man is sitting up against a wall.]
DANIEL
(to medics)
We managed to stop the bleeding, but you should get him to a
facility as soon as possible.
[The second medic touches Daniel on the chest with some device, causing
a yellow electrical discharge. Daniel cries out in pain and collapses.
The medic holds him sitting up on the floor, pulls a gun from his
medical bag, and aims it at Vala. Mitchell in turn aims his P-90 at the
medic.]
MITCHELL
Let him go.
[The medic lowers his weapon and lowers Daniel to the floor. Daniel is
grimacing and moving slightly. At Mitchell's gesture, the medics go
down on their stomachs on the floor. Vala kneels beside Daniel and
checks his pulse.]
MITCHELL
(to Vala)
Jackson?
VALA
He's okay.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Mitchell drags a tied up medic to the crowd of people sitting on the
floor. He is yelling into the radio at the same time.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Are you people out of your minds or are you just plain stupid? Do
you know anything about hostage negotiations? This is no way to gain
our trust!
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
[A high-level official is now speaking into the radio.]
QUARTUS
(into radio)
My name is Quartus. I've taken command of this operation.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Mitchell walks toward Daniel as he talks.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Look, we have one of your people here who needs help. We're willing
to let him go and this is how you repay us!
[Daniel is lying unconscious, his head pillowed on one of the medic's
bags. Vala is beside him.]
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
QUARTUS
(over radio)
I am the Chief Negotiation Officer for the Federal Security Council.
I promise you things will be different. My only concern is meeting
your demands and freeing the hostages.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
MITCHELL
(into radio)
See, that's funny; that's what the last guy said.
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
QUARTUS
(into radio)
I can offer you many things, but if any of the hostages die--
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Just don't try any more stupid stunts.
(emphatic)
We don't want to hurt anyone.
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
QUARTUS
Good, good. If that changes, you should know that there's no escape.
We have you completely surrounded.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Sometime later, Mitchell and Teal'c are pacing the area.]
VALA
Hey. Mitchell!
[Daniel is waking, putting a hand to his eyes. Mitchell walks over.]
MITCHELL
Jackson! You okay?
VALA
They zapped you.
DANIEL
(putting on his glasses)
Oh I got that, thank you. What did I miss?
[Mitchell puts out a hand and helps Daniel to stand.]
MITCHELL
Well, the real negotiator got here. He wants to know what our
demands are.
DANIEL
Mmmm. Any ideas?
MITCHELL
A jet to Algeria?
VALA
How about a real DHD.
DANIEL
No, we need these demands to make sense, I mean, something these
rebels would actually say.
[The man who had been paying close attention speaks up from the crowd.]
CICERO
Excuse me? Did you really come through the ring?
DANIEL
Yes, we did.
CICERO
It's a portal, isn't it? To other worlds.
MITCHELL
Yeah. I'd be happy to show you how it works...once we get it up and
running again.
CICERO
You want them to free your friends.
MITCHELL
I'm sorry, what?
CICERO
Your demands. If you want to pose as the rebels, the first thing
they usually do in situations like this is ask for the freeing of
their imprisoned compatriots.
SYLVANA
Don't talk to them.
CICERO
No, it's okay.
[Mitchell, Daniel, and Vala stand in front of Cicero and the other
seated hostages.]
DANIEL
What's your name?
CICERO
Cicero. I'm a researcher here at the museum...and I believe you.
MITCHELL
You wanna get on the radio and explain that to the folks outside?
CICERO
Oh, I've tried. I've suspected as much for years. I've published
dozens of papers, written a book. No one listens. My colleagues
think I'm a bit of a joke.
VALA
Oh Daniel, you've found a kindred spirit.
DANIEL
Uh, on most planets, found along with the ring, is what we call a
DHD. It's a dialing device. It's similar to the one you have back in
the exhibit. Do you have the real one here?
CICERO
We found fragments of it, but the one in the pyramid room is a
reconstruction from some diagrams we found.
MITCHELL
Yeah we know, that's why we're stuck.
VALA
Well, if one of the fragments is the power source...
MITCHELL
Cicero? Stand up.
[Cicero stands.]
MITCHELL
I need you to take us to your lab.
CICERO
Of course!
DANIEL
Wait a second. I'm gonna need a primer on these rebels first.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
[Quartus has moved inside a room with several other men in uniform.
There are blueprints of the layout of the museum on the wall as well as
communications equipment. Quartus listens to Daniel on the radio.]
DANIEL
(over radio)
And after they're freed, we'd like the Viceroy to call a referendum
on dissolving his government. And finally, we wanna make a public
statement on the...
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(reading from a notepad)
...Gaynord transmitters, to address the people of this proud nation.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
That's unacceptable.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Excuse me?
QUARTUS
(into radio)
Believe me, I want this to end well for both of us, but as you
should know from previous attempts at political terrorism like this,
the Viceroy would rather sacrifice the hostages before bowing to
such demands.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Daniel closes his eyes in frustration and turns to Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Remind me to thank Cicero for his wonderful intel.
(into radio)
What about freeing the imprisoned rebels?
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
That'll take time.
DANIEL
(over radio)
Oh, absolutely! We recognize that, so you-you take all the time you
need. Yeah! You run that through the proper channels; you talk to
who you need to talk to. We're in no rush.
QUARTUS
(into radio, somber)
I'm sure the hostages would disagree with that.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio, certain)
They're fine! We're not gonna hurt them.
[He turns toward Teal'c, who gives him a stern look.]
DANIEL
(feigning being threatening)
Unless you get cute! In which case there's gonna be killin'
and...whatnot.
[Teal'c rolls his eyes.]
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
All right. I'll see what I can do.
[An aide gets word from another team member.]
LOURDES
Sir, we have a man on an auxiliary channel. Claims to be inside the
museum. Says he's a security guard.
[Quartus changes his radio to a different frequency.]
QUARTUS
(into radio)
Who am I talking to?
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
[The man who had witnessed the initial confrontation is making his way
stealthily through the museum.]
JAYEM
(into radio)
Jayem Seran, sir.
[He pulls a gun as he comes around a corner.]
JAYEM
(into radio)
Night Guard. Second class.
QUARTUS
(over radio)
And you're inside the museum right now?
JAYEM
(into radio)
Yes, sir.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
How did you escape the initial attack?
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
Uh, I wasn't there, sir. I was doing my rounds. By the time I got on
the scene, the fight was over. There was nothing I could do, sir.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
No need to apologize. Engaging them would have been a mistake.
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
[Jayem is making his way with exaggerated caution down the hall.]
JAYEM
(into radio)
I always wanted to serve on the Council's Guard, sir. But some
mistakes I made when I was a kid messed up my record.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
Listen...
JAYEM
(over radio)
I've been a guard at this museum for ten years now. I know it like
the back of my hand.
QUARTUS
(into radio)
We have a complete set of schematics out here. Not to worry.
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
Well, I'm sure you do, but I am on the inside. I can be your ears.
Your eyes.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio)
You know what would be the most help?
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
Standing by for your orders...sir.
QUARTUS
(over radio)
Find a safe place. Stay there and wait until this whole thing is
over.
JAYEM
(into radio, surprised)
Well, what are you gonna do?
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUARTUS
(into radio, firmly)
That's not your concern, guardsman. Our plan just doesn't involve
you. Don't get in the way.
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(doubtful)
Very well. Jayem out.
[He turns off his radio and begins walking, somewhat defeated. After a
moment he stops, as if he has realized something.]
JAYEM
(to himself)
Our radios must be compromised. He doesn't want me to stand down. He
just needs it to look like I'm standing down!
[He raises his gun and moves off.]
INT--CICERO'S LAB IN MUSEUM
[The lab is small and cluttered. Cicero pulls a box from a shelf as he
talks to Mitchell and Vala. They have been searching the items for a
power source for the DHD.]
CICERO
The Viceroy's attempt to separate the Governing Council from the
Circle of Heavens is controversial, but the majority of the people
are on his side.
MITCHELL
Ha--Hang on! They think we're some kind of radical religious sect?
CICERO
That's right. The rebels are growing stronger every day.
Unfortunately, you couldn't have picked a worse time to be mistaken
for them.
MITCHELL
How's that?
CICERO
They've had a string of successes against the Council and its
members. The Viceroy needs a win to show his might. If this is
handled badly, it could turn into a bloody mess very quickly.
MITCHELL
(putting his hand to his face in frustration)
I'll keep that positive thinking going, Cicero.
(to Vala)
Anything?
VALA
Uh, nope!
CICERO
My co-worker has an archive on the other side of the building. It's
possible other pieces we found are stored there.
MITCHELL
(gesturing for him to go)
Lead the way.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[The hostages all sit on the floor in a group. Daniel looks impatiently
at his watch as Teal'c patrols. A woman sits beside the couple who had
stolen away from the party and discovered SG-1. The man, Heren, sits in
the middle.]
SYLVANA
What were you and Heren doing in the hallway?
WOMAN
What?
SYLVANA
In the hallway. Before you came out screaming. What were you doing?
WOMAN
Looking at some of the other exhibits.
SYLVANA
(challenging)
But the museum is closed. We were told everything outside the lobby
is off limits.
WOMAN
We were?
SYLVANA
(to Heren)
Did she kiss you?
HEREN
What, me? No...
SYLVANA
(to the other woman)
You did, didn't you?
WOMAN
(defensive, angry)
You hardly spoke to him all night. I didn't think you were
interested anymore.
SYLVANA
(nearly yelling)
Why do you always do this? Why must you always try to take
everything that is mine and try to make it your own?
WOMAN
He was hardly yours.
SYLVANA
I hate you!
[Sylvana grabs her former friend, and they start pulling each other's
hair and fighting.]
DANIEL
(amazed and very irritated)
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!!
[The stop fighting.]
WOMAN
She started it!
SYLVANA
Hah! I think you started it when you kissed Heren.
[Daniel leans over them.]
DANIEL
(exasperated, nearly crying in frustration)
Shut up! Shut up! You're hostages! This is like a life and death
situation here! Start acting like it.
SYLVANA
Oh, please! You're not rebels! We're not deaf, you know. Everyone in
this room knows it.
DANIEL
That doesn't matter! You're hostages! We're your...we're your
captors! We're heavily armed! There's rules! There's a whole school
of etiquette to this!
[Sylvana closes her mouth but gives him a glare.]
DANIEL
(pointing an admonishing finger)
Don't eyeball me.
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
[Cicero leads Mitchell and Vala across the museum. The latter two use
their flashlights to light the way through the dark hallways.]
CICERO
An artificial stable wormhole. Fascinating.
MITCHELL
Yep! Pretty darn nifty, huh?
CICERO
And the galaxy is populated. Other people on other planets?
VALA
A couple of galaxies as a matter of fact.
CICERO
Amazing.
MITCHELL
Hey, when you guys found the uh, gate in the pyramid, there wasn't a
stash of advanced alien weapons, was there?
CICERO
No, I'm afraid not.
MITCHELL
Yeah, just a shot in the dark, anyway.
VALA
You know, if we--well, will you look at that.
[She has seen something in a display case.]
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
MITCHELL
Is that what I think it is?
VALA
No, it's a Goa'uld naquadah bomb.
MITCHELL
For the record, that's what I thought it was.
VALA
(patronizing)
Yes, I'm sure you did.
[They arrive at the glass display case and examine what's inside. It is
a large golden Goa'uld case with a green sphere inside: the bomb.]
VALA
Well, it seems in pretty good shape. If it's real and if the
naquadah core is intact... I assume these cases are connected to the
security system.
CICERO
Yes.
VALA
So we can't get into the case.
CICERO
(referring to the card reader on the wall)
You won't be able to access it without a security card.
MITCHELL
And you have one of those. No?
CICERO
Not for these exhibits, no.
MITCHELL
(disappointed)
Hmm.
VALA
Well, not to worry. You happen to be standing next to one of the
best thieves in two galaxies.
CICERO
(looking at Mitchell)
Ah!
VALA
No, not him. So if anyone can get this bomb out with no security
card, it is me. Watch and learn, boys. Removal of treasure from a
sealed glass enclosure.
[She pops her knuckles and kneels down in front of the display case.]
VALA
Step one: identify the tamper circuit and try to bypass it.
[The circuit is embedded in the glass.]
VALA
When circuit proves inaccessible, go to step two. Cut a
treasure-sized hole in the glass.
[She pulls a large suction cup from her backpack and attaches it to the
glass.]
MITCHELL
You just happen to carry one of those around with you?
[She uses the piston to suction the cup onto the glass.]
VALA
One must always be prepared to liberate treasure, Cameron.
[She uses a hand cutter to score the glass around two suction pads and
within the tamper circuit. Mitchell pulls the glass out using the
suction cup's handle.]
VALA
Step three: examine the base of the object for pressure switch. When
found, bypass it.
[She cuts a wire to the pressure switch.]
VALA
And finally, we reach in...
[She begins to reach in. Mitchell grabs her and yanks her back out of
the way just as a metal grating falls from the ceiling in front of the
glass. They collect themselves and approach the inaccessible bomb.]
VALA
All right. Removal of treasure from a sealed metal enclosure.
MITCHELL
(impatient)
Nooo...
[Up the hallway, Jayem pokes his head out from the curtains and hears
Mitchell and Vala talking.]
MITCHELL
You rushed it.
VALA
Ah! I did not.
MITCHELL
You were showing off and you rushed it.
[Jayem heads toward the voices, his pistol raised.]
VALA
This is an alien security system that I've never experienced before,
and the fact that I got this far is very impressive.
[Cicero points and nods in agreement.]
MITCHELL
How do we get one of those cards?
CICERO
Oh--
[Jayem has snuck up on them and aims his pistol at them.]
JAYEM
You don't! Throw your guns to the floor. Now!
[Mitchell and Vala unhook their P-90s from their vests and lower them
to the floor.]
JAYEM
And the little ones on your legs.
[Mitchell and Vala pull out their pistol and zat and put them on the
floor.]
JAYEM
Well don't just stand there, Cicero.
CICERO
Huh?
JAYEM
(nodding toward the weapons)
Pick them up.
CICERO
Oh, right!
[Cicero bends and picks up all four weapons.]
JAYEM
Good, now come stand over here.
[Cicero stands beside Jayem.]
CICERO
Thanks! They uh, tried to make me get them a key card.
JAYEM
Yeah, I heard.
(to Mitchell)
Toss over your communicator.
MITCHELL
(trying to be calming, unhooking his radio)
Okay, relax. You got us. You're in control.
JAYEM
That's right. I am.
[Mitchell puts his radio on the floor and slides it to Jayem, who picks
it up and begins to fiddle with it.]
MITCHELL
You press the big button to talk.
JAYEM
(with false bravado)
Yeah, I know how to use it.
[He pushes the button.]
JAYEM
(into radio)
Murderous rebels. Come in, please.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio, puzzled)
Speaking?
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
I have your two friends. Let the hostages go, or I'm going to kill
them.
[Mitchell and Vala look unconcerned.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Excuse me?
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio, speaking quickly)
Your friends? I have them at gunpoint. If you don't let the rest of
the hostages go, I'm gonna kill them.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Who's calling?
JAYEM
(over radio)
Who I am is of no importance.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Oh, I disagree.
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(to Mitchell)
Tell him.
[He tosses the radio to Mitchell.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Jackson.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Mitchell, what's goin' on?
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Well, we've got ourselves a bit of a John McLane here.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
What? What are you talkin' about?
TEAL'C
(walking past Daniel)
"Die Hard."
DANIEL
Oh.
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
MITCHELL
(into radio)
A security guard got the drop on us, and I think he wants to trade.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
How do you wanna play this?
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Well, the two of us for all those hostages doesn't seem quite fair
now, does it?
JAYEM
(gesturing for the radio)
Now that's enough. Slide it over.
[Mitchell slides the radio back over.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
JAYEM
(over radio)
Okay, there. You've got proof that I've got them. Now let the
hostages go.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Uh...no.
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
You heard me, right? I'm gonna kill them.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Yeah, but if we let the hostages go we're all dead, so...no.
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
JAYEM
(into radio)
But...
[He releases the radio button and talks to those with him.]
JAYEM
Oh, I see.
[Jayem looks around suspiciously.]
CICERO
What is it?
JAYEM
They must know where we are. They've probably sent someone to come
rescue them already. Ah, they're quick, I'll give 'em that.
CICERO
Really?
JAYEM
Yeah. I just gotta stay one step ahead of them. You any good with a
gun?
CICERO
I've never fired one.
JAYEM
Oh, no, of course not. Uh, okay, okay--
[He lowers his guard for a moment, then points his pistol suddenly and
nervously at Vala, who holds her hands up dramatically but without
fear.]
JAYEM
Yes, okay. I'm going to go get into position down the hall, and when
their friends come looking for us, I'll get the drop on them, as
they say.
CICERO
Seems like the smart thing to do.
JAYEM
Yeah. All right, if those two try anything, shoot 'em.
CICERO
(pointing one of the pistols at Mitchell and Vala and nodding)
Of course, yeah.
[Jayem cocks his pistol and moves down the hall and around a corner.
Cicero hands Vala Mitchell's pistol and Mitchell her zat, which they
exchange with each other as he hands them their other weapons.]
CICERO
Sorry about that.
MITCHELL
It's all right. Happens all the time.
CICERO
He's a night security guard. Has been since I started working here.
He would never have killed you.
VALA
Yeah, we got that.
CICERO
He means well.
MITCHELL
Yeah, I'm sure he does, but we can't have him running around out
there. We'll be right back.
[Mitchell and Vala start walking the direction Jayem had taken.]
CICERO
Can I do anything?
[Looking back to reply.]
MITCHELL
No, we got it covered. Just...stay here.
[Cicero turns back to the display case then heads off down the hall.]
INT--HALLWAY OF MUSEUM
[In a different hallway, Jayem peers around a corner, pointing his
weapon ahead of him, although no one is there.]
JAYEM
Halt!
(trying again)
Disarm, rebel dogs!
[Mitchell and Vala have snuck up behind him and have their weapons
pointed at him. He slowly realizes and looks at them.]
MITCHELL
(to Vala)
He left himself wide open from behind. That was a mistake.
[Vala nods. Jayem slumps a bit.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Teal'c walks in.]
TEAL'C
One of the hostages is a nurse. She was able to stabilize the
wounded guard.
DANIEL
Oh, finally some good news.
CHANCELLOR
(speaking quietly to hostages around him)
It is my belief these men in fact are not rebels, but common
thieves. Now, if we rise up against them--
[Teal'c zats him, and he falls unconscious. Sylvana screams. Teal'c
crouches down in front of them and retracts the zat.]
TEAL'C
(nearly smiling)
Please remain calm...as we attempt to rectify this most unfortunate
circumstance.
INT--HALLWAY NEAR NAQUADAH BOMB IN MUSEUM
[Mitchell and Vala walk Jayem back, his hands now bound in front of
him.]
JAYEM
What have you done with Cicero? You killed him, didn't you?
MITCHELL
No he... Actually, where is Cicero?
VALA
I don't know.
JAYEM
What did you do with his body?
MITCHELL
He's fine! Probably just went to the bathroom or something.
JAYEM
Try selling your lies to someone else. Filthy rebel scum!
VALA
Okay. This display case, we need to get into it. You're security;
where's your access card?
[She holds out her hand for it.]
JAYEM
It's safe. Hidden away in a place you'll never find.
[Vala approaches him and starts rooting around in his pants pocket.]
JAYEM
No, no, no, no!
[She pulls the card out. Jayem sighs in defeat. Vala runs the card
through the card reader. Nothing happens.]
VALA
Hmm.
(smiling, to Jayem)
Enter your access code, please.
JAYEM
That is a rare, priceless artifact...and if you think I'm just gonna
stand here and let you steal it, you're out of your minds! Do
whatever you want to me. I'll never tell.
[He looks away defiantly.]
MITCHELL
(losing patience)
It is not a rare and priceless artifact. It's a bomb! Now we don't
want to hurt anyone, but we need its power source to get home, and
the sooner we do that, the sooner everyone can leave. So, what do
you say?
JAYEM
You'll have to kill me first!
[Vala hands the security card to Mitchell. He indicates for her to go
ahead. She takes a breath and stretches her fingers, then reaches in
and starts pushing buttons on the naquadah bomb's control panel.]
JAYEM
What are you doing?
VALA
(somberly)
I'm activating it.
JAYEM
(nervous)
Why? Wh-wh-wh why would you do that?
VALA
Well, if we can't have this device, we have no reason to live.
MITCHELL
Agreed. So what, do you think it'll take down the whole building?
VALA
Oh, absolutely. I mean, anyone within a few miles will probably be
incinerated. Maybe more.
MITCHELL
(with mock sadness)
And all because he wouldn't give us the code. Shame.
JAYEM
You're crazy!
MITCHELL
You ever meet a sane rebel?
JAYEM
Well, you make a good point.
MITCHELL
Make your peace with your maker.
[The light and glyph-based timer on the bomb is counting down.]
JAYEM
Ah! Okay, okay, I'll do it.
[He goes to the keypad of the card reader and enters his code. Vala and
Mitchell step away from the grating. The light on the card reader turns
green, and the grating lifts up into the ceiling. Now the bomb is
reachable through the hole Vala had carved in the glass.]
MITCHELL
You made the right choice.
[Vala steps up and a series of inputs to the bomb control panel, then
repeats it several times.]
VALA
That's interesting.
MITCHELL
What?
VALA
Well I'm not sure I can turn this off.
MITCHELL
(disbelieving)
You actually turned it on?
VALA
Yes!
MITCHELL
Why would you do that?
VALA
Well a number of reasons. Firstly, to see if it was real and
secondly, we needed to make it look convincing.
MITCHELL
(trying to understand)
We did.
VALA
We needed to fool him.
MITCHELL
(irritated)
What does he know? He wouldn't have been able to tell the
difference, Vala!
JAYEM
Um, actually, I probably would have.
MITCHELL
Oh please! You didn't know it was a bomb until I told you so.
JAYEM
I had suspected it.
MITCHELL
No, you didn't!
JAYEM
Check my service logs.
MITCHELL
Stop talking!
JAYEM
I specifically made a note--
[He stops talking in response to Mitchell's order. Mitchell takes
Vala's arms and spins her around to face the bomb.]
MITCHELL
What's the countdown clock set to?
VALA
Um, an hour, give or take...
(turning back to Mitchell)
a few minutes.
[Mitchell glare speechlessly at her, but she gives a big smile back.]
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Mitchell and Jayem carry the large golden box that holds the naquadah
bomb into the gate room.]
VALA
It's not that big a deal.
MITCHELL
Oh, really.
VALA
Once we interface it with the gate, establishing a secure connection
should completely deplete its power source, which would mean it
won't explode.
MITCHELL
We now have less than fifty, give or take a few minutes, to get that
done!
VALA
Maybe more.
MITCHELL
Count on less.
[The men set the box down beside the gate.]
INT--STORAGE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Cicero enters the security code into a keypad next to a door to the
outside. He opens the door to the glaring lights of the government
forces. He steps into the light and puts his hands into the air as
troops surround him, telling him to do so.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Daniel looks at the laptop connected to the security system of the
museum.]
DANIEL
Teal'c, the door on the south side just opened up.
[Teal'c jogs to the metal gate to investigate. Daniel covers him with
his P-90. Through a window, Teal'c sees Cicero forced to lie on his
stomach on the ground and hears the soldier yelling at him.]
SOLDIER
(outside)
Stay on him!
DANIEL
What do you see?
TEAL'C
Cicero. It would appear he has escaped.
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Mitchell talks to Daniel on his radio.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
He what?
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
He left. He just left. Why would he do that?
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Mitchell signs off. Jayem speaks up from where he is sitting with his
hands tied behind his back. Vala is working on connecting the bomb as a
power source to the gate.]
JAYEM
Hah! Looks like he slipped right through your fingers.
MITCHELL
He was working with us, you idiot! How do you think we got our guns
back?
JAYEM
It's so sad that you feel the need to lie to me.
MITCHELL
(to Vala, desperate)
What the hell does Cicero think he's doing?
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
[Cicero talks with great urgency to Quartus, who has his back to Cicero
and rolls his eyes in annoyance.]
CICERO
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. The pyramid ring acts as a
connection point between many worlds. Many of us have thought so for
some time, but were unable to activate it, to prove it. They aren't
rebels. They don't know anything about our world.
QUARTUS
Their demands would prove otherwise, Cicero.
CICERO
I told them what to say. I told them what to demand.
[Quartus angrily turns toward Cicero.]
QUARTUS
You did what?
CICERO
All they need is time. Our ring is broken. Once their friends
realize they're stuck here, they'll send help.
QUARTUS
Their friends? Others are on the way?
CICERO
Yes. They just needed to stall a bit, so I told them what to say. I
know, it maybe wasn't the best thing to do. But a chance for us to
actually communicate with beings from another world? This may be the
greatest day in the history of our planet.
[Quartus appears worried.]
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Vala works on the bomb. Mitchell keeps watch over Jayem.]
DANIEL
(over radio)
You guys, I'm starting to get a little worried.
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Welcome to the club.
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
No, this Quartus guy has checked in with me every ten minutes like
clockwork.
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
MITCHELL
And?
DANIEL
(over radio)
And it's been over twenty minutes now. The silence is starting to
make me feel uneasy. How goes it on your end?
MITCHELL
(to Vala)
How goes it on our end?
VALA
I think I have it. Maybe.
MITCHELL
Vala?
[Vala is seated next to the box. There are leads going from crystals on
the side of the box to the gate.]
VALA
There's a seventy percent chance that if we dial manually, we'll be
able to establish a connection and a fifty percent chance the bomb
will just go off.
MITCHELL
That's a hundred and twenty percent.
VALA
Well there's some crossover, where we establish a wormhole and it
blows up.
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Jackson, did you catch any of that?
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
DANIEL
(into radio)
Yeah, one hundred percent chance we should have brought someone that
knows what they're doing. Yeah, I heard. Daniel out.
[Daniel paces in front of the hostages.]
INT--GATE ROOM OF MUSEUM
VALA
Well, I'm gonna need your help dialing this thing.
[She stands. Mitchell follows.]
VALA
(pointing to a glyph and gesturing upward)
Okay, this one. Up the top.
INT--GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTER
LOURDES
Have you spoken with the Viceroy?
QUARTUS
(quiet and determined)
Yes. The Viceroy has denied all of their demands... We have to end
this...now.
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Vala and Mitchell spin the inner ring of the gate by hand. Four
chevrons are already lit. Now a fifth chevron lights.]
JAYEM
What does that thing do? Is that a bomb? Why is it lighting up like
that? Are you activating it? You're gonna kill us all, aren't you?
[Fed up, Mitchell grabs a roll of tape and approaches Jayem.]
JAYEM
Your restraints won't hold me forever. You might as well set me free
and turn yourselves in. 'Cause if you don't, I'm--
[Jayem makes a muffled scream then stops after Mitchell sticks a length
of electrical tape over his mouth.]
VALA
Much better.
[Mitchell brushes his hands together in satisfaction.]
MITCHELL
Don't know why I didn't think of that earlier.
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
[The special ops forces are mobilizing and running toward the
building.]
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson. We are about to have company.
DANIEL
(into radio)
Guys, we need to get out of here now.
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[They are still pushing on the inner ring.]
VALA
Just a little bit more!
[The last chevron locks. Vala pulls Mitchell out of the way of the
wormhole back-splash.]
EXT--OUTSIDE MUSEUM, NIGHT
[The forces begin to enter the door that Cicero had exited, and other
doors as well.]
SOLDIERS
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go!
INT--MAIN HALL OF MUSEUM
[Daniel hears beeping on the laptop and rushes over to it, confirming
the assault has started.]
MITCHELL
(over radio)
Teal'c, Jackson, fall back to the gate. We have a connection.
DANIEL
Timing!
[He rushes over to the hostages.]
DANIEL
Okay, I wanna thank you guys for all your patience today. I suggest
you stay on the floor with your hands on your head until your police
have figured out you're not the bad guys.
[Glass in the ceiling breaks and falls down into the room, causing some
hostages to scream. The assault forces begin firing on Daniel and
Teal'c, who are running out of the room. Some soldiers rappel down into
the room on ropes. They all begin following Daniel and Teal'c.]
INT--HALLWAY IN MUSEUM
SOLDIER
They're heading down the north hallway!
[Daniel and Teal'c two make it around a corner just as the forces stop
to fire on them. The pursuit continues.]
INT--GATE ROOM IN MUSEUM
[Mitchell runs to the corner near the exit and raises his weapon.
Daniel arrives first, yelling for Mitchell to move.]
DANIEL
Run!
[They all run for the wormhole but are stopped by armed soldiers who
have entered from another door and now bar their way. The team raise
their arms. More soldiers and Quartus enter from behind. Jayem makes
his way from where he has been sitting to Quartus, making as much noise
as he can with the tape over his mouth. Quartus rips the tape off.]
JAYEM
Ow! They've got a bomb, sir. It's set to go off.
VALA
Relax. Umm.
(setting her gun down)
Connecting a wormhole to the gate has depleted the naquadah core to
a point where it's no longer a threat.
JAYEM
Don't believe them, sir. They're devious. And they speak in code to
each other.
MITCHELL
Cicero told you who we are, didn't he?
[Quartus takes a radio from a soldier and activates it.]
QUARTUS
(into radio)
Let him in.
QUARTUS
He told us who he thinks you are.
[Cicero enters and sees the active wormhole.]
CICERO
Oh my.
DANIEL
Look, we never wanted to hurt anybody. We just want to go home,
okay? And that ring is how we do that. Please just let us leave. All
we have to do is walk through that. Once we're gone, it will shut
down and no one will be harmed, I promise.
QUARTUS
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
MITCHELL
(exasperated)
Oh crap. Look, we all know what you're going through! We-We've all
been there. Hell, when I first heard there were alien worlds and
races out there, I...freaked...out. I was afraid. Afraid of how
advanced they might be. Afraid of what their intentions were. Afraid
they might come to my world and kill me. And I'll be honest with
you, there are worlds and races out there who do mean you and your
people harm, but we're not one of 'em, and you're lucky you ran into
us before you ran into them. Now, I will admit that our first
contact was not ideal. In fact, it could well be our worst.
[He looks at Daniel, who grimaces and wags his hand as if to say it
isn't quite the worst.]
MITCHELL
But you do not want your first foray into interplanetary relations
to be a violent one.
[He holds up his hands but approaches Quartus, who signals for his men
to stay back.]
MITCHELL
(calm but threatening)
We're a peaceful people, but we do not take acts of aggression lying
down. So you let us walk through that ring, and when and how we meet
again, will be under your control. Prevent us from leaving, and it
won't be.
CICERO
Please, Quartus. This is the future of our people.
QUARTUS
Lower your weapons.
[The soldiers lower their weapons.]
MITCHELL
Thank you.
[Mitchell pulls out his GDO and activates his radio.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
This is Colonel Mitchell. SG-1 is returning a little early.
Transmitting iris code now.
[He enters the code into the GDO then steps up to the wormhole. The
others follow, and Quartus moves closer. SG-1 enters the wormhole, and
it shuts down.]
JAYEM
(amazed)
It's true. Everything they said was true. I don't believe it.
QUARTUS
(determined)
And neither will anyone else.
JAYEM
What?
QUARTUS
You are a hero, Jayem Seran, Nightguard Second Class.
JAYEM
I am?
CICERO
He is?
QUARTUS
Four rebels attacked a private function with several key councillors
in attendance. But you foiled their plan. You killed them all and
saved all of the hostages.
CICERO
You're going to cover this up? You can't do this!
QUARTUS
(threatening)
I could easily say, he saved all but one of the hostages.
CICERO
I want to talk to the Viceroy.
[They walk away,leaving Jayem alone looking at the Stargate; his hands
are still tied behind him.]
JAYEM
(very pleased)
I'm a hero!
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Landry walks with Daniel, Vala, Mitchell, and Teal'c.]
DANIEL
We tried making a connection twice, sir. No luck.
LANDRY
Could it be a problem with that gate, say, as a result of some
tampering with the gate to get a connection?
[He glances back at Vala.]
VALA
Hey! I saved our hides, thank you very much.
DANIEL
We don't think so, sir. Our attempts to dial the gate should have
worked.
TEAL'C
They have undoubtedly buried the gate.
LANDRY
So they just stuck their heads in the sand? Even after everything
you told 'em?
MITCHELL
Maybe they figure they got their own issues to deal with before they
start dealing with the ones out here, sir.
LANDRY
Unfortunately, we don't have that option, do we?
[They arrive at the gate control room.]
