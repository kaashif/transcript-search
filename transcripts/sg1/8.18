TEASER
PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE SG-1
[Flashback from "Divide and Conquer" Season 4.]
CARTER
Something neither one of us can admit given our working
relationship, our military ranks?
[O'Neill and Carter look at each other from either side of the force
field.]
[O'Neill is strapped into the Zatarc detector chair.]
O'NEILL
I didn't leave... because I care about her.
[Flashback from "Grace" Season 7.]
JACOB
It's time to let go of the things that prevent you from finding
happiness. You deserve to love someone.
[Carter is in tears.]
[Flashback from "Chimera" Season 7.]
[O'Neill and Carter are in an elevator.]
O'NEILL
What's his name?
CARTER
Now, why would...?
O'NEILL
Humming.
[Carter looks at O'Neill briefly then turns away.]
CARTER
Pete.
O'NEILL
Pete.
CARTER
Pete Shanahan, he's a cop.
[Flashback from "Affinity" Season 8.]
[Pete shows Carter a ring box, containing a diamond ring. Carter is
completely surprised.]
CARTER
Oh, my God!
[Pete looks at her, smiling slightly.]
[Flashback from "Meridian" Season 5.]
DANIEL:
Maybe I did something good every now and again, but nothing I've
ever done seems to have changed anything.
OMA
There is really only one thing we can ever truly control. Either we
are good or evil.
[Daniel turns to look at Oma.]
[Flashback from "Full Circle" Season 6.]
ANUBIS
I know who you are Daniel Jackson, but you know not who I am.
[Anubis' face starts to glow. He is an ascended being.]
[Daniel raises his hands and directs energy at Anubis. The energy is
blown back as Anubis raises his hand to defend himself. Her'ak cowers
on the floor.]
DANIEL
No. Don't do this!
[Daniel is spirited away.]
[Flashback from "Fallen Part 1" Season 7.]
[A man is lying naked on the ground.]
O'NEILL
Last year, you died.
DANIEL
I'm dead?
O'NEILL
Actually, you...ascended to a higher plane of existence.
[Flashbacks from "Reckoning Part 1" and "Reckoning Part 2" Season 8.]
[Replicators swarm through the ship. They zoom in on Daniel and beam
him away.]
BRA'TAC
He was beamed away before our very eyes.
[Replicator Carter and Daniel are in a tent, which suddenly changes to
the inside of the Replicator ship.]
OMA
The human-form Replicator is attempting to probe your mind as we
speak.
[Daniel is encased by Replicator blocks which retreat into the wall,
freeing him.]
OMA
When she is done she will destroy you. And when that time comes you
will be faced with a choice.
[Daniel walks towards Replicator Carter but her hand transforms into
the huge knife which she used to kill Yu. She stabs Daniel, the knife
going completely through his body.]
[Ba'al is in Anubis' temple.]
BA'AL
A force of rebel Jaffa have managed to take control of the temple at
Dakara.
ANUBIS
Have the fleet disengage their battle with the Replicators. Take it
back at all cost.
[Carter and Jacob find the inner room containing the Ancient weapon.]
TEAL'C
We have found the Ancient weapon on Dakara.
[A huge energy wave is released from the Ancient weapon and all
Replicators are destroyed.]
[Daniel is lying dead on the Replicators ship. Replicator Carter looks
up as the energy wave approaches and destroys the ship.]
[Carter and O'Neill are in his office.]
CARTER
You think Daniel had something to do with it?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
[Carter nods.]
[End flashbacks.]
EXT--ANUBIS' PLANET
INT--ANUBIS' TEMPLE
[Ba'al enters and walks to Anubis, who is sitting on his throne.]
ANUBIS
You have failed me.
BA'AL
We've known for some time that the Jaffa cannot be trusted any more.
The remaining army of Kull Warriors still stand an excellent chance
of retaking Dakara.
[Anubis, blisters around his mouth, raises his hand to stop Ba'al.]
ANUBIS
Worse than failure. Worse than cowardice.
[Anubis stands, taking a step closer to Ba'al.]
ANUBIS
You have betrayed me. Did you not think I would know what you have
done? How can you still underestimate my powers?
BA'AL
Your methods were ultimately unnecessary. Not when there was another
way of defeating the Replicators.
ANUBIS
I will spare your life for the moment, only so that you may witness
the fruits of your labours. First, I will retake Dakara, then,
thanks to the modifications you've made to the Stargate, I will
destroy every living thing in this galaxy, including you, all at
once.
BA'AL
I do not understand. You could have modified the Stargate yourself.
ANUBIS
You have no way of knowing what is necessary and what is not, in the
grand design.
[Ba'al looks puzzled.]
BA'AL
Whose grand design?
ANUBIS
Mine!
[As Anubis leaves, Ba'al stares at him.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter enters the briefing room and walks towards O'Neill's office.
She pauses as a woman's voice is heard from the office. O'Neill and the
woman are standing by the corridor door, then the woman leaves. Carter
appears uncomfortable. O'Neill shuts the corridor door, turns to his
desk and sees Carter. He beckons her in. Carter grimaces slightly, then
walks into the office.]
INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE
CARTER
Sorry, Sir. I saw you were with someone. I didn't want to interrupt.
O'NEILL
What's up?
CARTER
Who was that?
O'NEILL
Um, Kerry Johnson. CIA.
[O'Neill sits, while Carter stands at the side of the desk.]
CARTER
I've heard the name. Oh, she was heading up the investigation into
Goa'uld still at large after the incident with The Trust.
O'NEILL
Yeah.
CARTER
Sir, I wanted to talk to you about...
O'NEILL
Carter.
CARTER
We haven't heard from him in a week.
O'NEILL
Doesn't mean anything.
CARTER
Sir, we know he was captured by Replicators. Chances are he was
onboard a replicator ship when it disintegrated.
O'NEILL
All we know for sure is that he's missing.
CARTER
Sooner or later...
O'NEILL
Forget it! I'm not falling for it this time!
CARTER
Falling for it?
O'NEILL
Yeah. How many times have you thought he was gone and then he shows
up... in one form or another. I'm sorry, but we're not having a
memorial service for someone who is not dead.
[He looks up at the corner of the room.]
O'NEILL
(shouts)
Do you hear that? I'm not buying it!
[Carter looks around the room then looks at O'Neill, surprised. O'Neill
also looks around the room, waiting for a response from Daniel. He
looks at Carter, seeing that she is staring at him, bemused.]
O'NEILL
What?
[Carter raises her eyebrows then looks down.]
O'NEILL
He's just waiting for us to say a bunch of nice things about him.
Next thing you know, he'll come waltzing through that door. Like,
right now.
[O'Neill gestures to the corridor door. Both he and Carter look at the
door and wait.]
O'NEILL
Waltzing.
[Carter turns to look at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Now.
[As nothing happens, O'Neill turns to find Carter once again looking at
him in amazement.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel enters a diner from a sunlit street. The diner is busy, with
many customers at the booths and staff bustling around. A 'Please seat
yourself' sign is just inside the entrance. Daniel looks around,
frowning and walks further into the diner. He looks around at the
customers then sits in a booth. A waitress walks up to him.]
OMA
So, what can I get for you?
[The waitress is Oma Desala. Daniel stares at her, shocked.]
INT--DAKARA TEMPLE
[A number of Jaffa are in the temple. Teal'c, Bra'tac and Tolok stand
before them.]
TOLOK
Brothers Bra'tac of Chulak and Teal'c of the Tau'ri. For your
enduring courage and vision, for the strength of will that has
brought us to freedom from the Goa'uld, a future we have yet to even
comprehend, but one that will be determined by our own unfettered
will, I hereby bestow upon you the highest honour any Jaffa can
know.
[Tolok places the tip of a staff weapon to their shoulders.]
TOLOK
From this day forward, you shall both be known as blood kin, to all
Jaffa!!
[The Jaffa cheer. Tolok raises his hand to silence the Jaffa, who all
kneel to Teal'c and Bra'tac. They both look at each other, unhappy to
see the Jaffa kneeling. Bra'tac walks up to Tolok and, taking his arm,
makes him rise.]
BRA'TAC
Brothers!
[The other Jaffa rise.]
BRA'TAC
From this day forward, no Jaffa shall bow before anyone, and never
again before a false God.
[Teal'c nods at Bra'tac and Tolok. Tolok turns to the assembled Jaffa.]
TOLOK
Hail, Brother Bra'tac! Hail, Brother Teal'c!
[The Jaffa yell out in response, and a horn is blown. Teal'c and
Bra'tac, hands to their hearts, turn to walk out.]
BRA'TAC
Be proud, Teal'c. Today we are free.
TEAL'C
This day is not yet over with.
[They walk to the entrance to see thousands of Jaffa gathered below,
who raise their arms and shout.]
BRA'TAC
Then I shall be proud for you, and of you.
[Teal'c and Bra'tac turn to each other, smiling slightly.]
EXT--DAKARA
[A number of ships hover over the planet, while more fly overhead the
thousands of Jaffa.]
EXT--SGC COMPLEX DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter is standing in the corridor outside an elevator, appearing
nervous. The elevator opens to show Pete and an Airman.]
PETE
Hey!
[Pete steps out of the elevator.]
CARTER
Hi! Thank you, Airman.
[As the Airman walks away, Pete kisses her on the cheek.]
PETE
So, this is exciting. What's the surprise?
CARTER
You'll see.
[They start to walk along the corridor.]
PETE
Do I get to go through the Stargate? I mean, what planet are we
going to?
CARTER
You don't get to go through the Stargate.
PETE
Okay. I'm a little disappointed. Still, full security clearance and
an all access pass to the SGC? This must be big.
CARTER
Oh, it's big.
INT--SGC GUEST QUARTERS
[Carter knocks on the door then enters, Pete behind her. Jacob is
sitting in a chair and rises as they walk in.]
CARTER
Pete Shanahan. Jacob Carter. Dad, this is Pete.
[Pete appears stunned.]
PETE
Dad?
JACOB
Not quite yet. You have to actually marry my daughter before you can
call me that.
[Carter grins.]
PETE
I was just... I meant...stammer, stammer. It's an honour to meet
you, Sir.
[Pete steps forward to shake Jacob's hand.]
PETE
Really.
[He turns to Carter.]
PETE
Why didn't you tell me?
[Carter is grinning nervously.]
CARTER
I didn't want you to be nervous.
PETE
Why would I? I wouldn't. I... I've been dying to meet you.
JACOB
I think it was Sam that was nervous.
PETE
How did not telling me help?
CARTER
It didn't.
[Pete and Jacob look at each other. In the silence, Carter looks
uncomfortable. Jacob looks serious as Pete continues to smile.]
PETE
This is great! You really got one of those things in your head?
[Carter looks at Pete, the question wiping the smile off her face.]
JACOB
If by one of those things, you mean a 2,000 year old Tok'ra
symbiote. Yes.
PETE
Seriously. Come on... that has got to freak you right out sometimes.
It's weird.
[Carter smiles and shakes her head, while Jacob simply looks at Pete.
As Jacob looks at Carter, she again smiles nervously, turning to Pete
who is still grinning.]
INT--DINER
[Oma, notebook in hand, is standing at Daniel's table. A man (Jim),
sitting at the counter, turns round to speak to Oma.]
JIM
Hey!
[Oma and Daniel turn to look at him.]
JIM
What do I have to do to get some more coffee around here?
OMA
Find your enlightenment.
[Oma turns back to look at Daniel, obviously waiting for him to order.]
DANIEL
Menus?
OMA
We don't need them here, just order what you'd like.
DANIEL
Okay, I'll have the truth with a side order of clarity, please.
OMA
The replicator version of Sam was in your head trying to access the
knowledge buried in your subconscious. But you gained control of her
instead. She killed you to stop you. That's where I stepped in.
How's that?
DANIEL
Pretty clear.
OMA
Well, we aim to please. Customer comes first, you know.
DANIEL
So I'm ascended again.
OMA
Not exactly. Sort of a stop along the way. You have to make that
choice for yourself.
DANIEL
Waffles.
OMA
Bacon on the side?
DANIEL
No, I remember this place.
OMA
You should, it came from your mind.
DANIEL
My Grandfather brought me here after my parents' funeral. I had
waffles.
OMA
Waffles it is!
[Oma turns to leave.]
DANIEL
Wait. How do I know it's really you this time. How do I know this
isn't some trick Replicator Sam's playing to stop me from
controlling her?
[Oma steps back to Daniel.]
OMA
How deep is the river if you cannot see the bottom?
[Jim turns, waving his coffee mug.]
JIM
Deeper than the coffee in my cup, I'll tell you that.
OMA
(to Daniel)
Excuse me.
[Oma walks away.]
OMA
Frank, I need a Noah's boy in a blanket, two hen fruit wrecked on a
shingle with a mystery in the alley.
[Daniel looks bemused.]
OMA
A warm Eve with a moldy lid and two checkerboards, all right?
[Oma walks behind the counter and places the order on a hook.]
OMA
Oh yeah, hold the pig.
EXT--DAKARA
[A couple of ships fly past the temple.]
INT--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM
[Teal'c is standing by the Ancient computer as Bra'tac walks up to
him.]
BRA'TAC
We have dreamed of this day for so long. Fought so hard for it and
sacrificed so much. Now that it is here...
TEAL'C
It is not here, brother.
BRA'TAC
The balance of power has shifted, Teal'c. Our victory here at Dakara
has turned the tide. Jaffa everywhere are abandoning the old ways,
coming to see the Goa'uld for the false Gods they are.
TEAL'C
We are foolish to rejoice in conquest over the Goa'uld when they are
not all dead. Anubis' claim to be a God is false, but his powers
most certainly are not.
BRA'TAC
It is agreed. He must be dealt with. But for once, there may be
greater concerns than the eradication of all the Goa'uld. So
consumed were we in attaining freedom, that we did not plan nearly
enough for its aftermath. The Jaffa have fought with each other for
so long that uniting them as one may prove as difficult a task as
convincing them to free themselves from the Goa'uld. Generations of
war and mistrust will not be healed overnight.
TEAL'C
Indeed. If we do not organize quickly freedom will become anarchy.
BRA'TAC
The High Priests are proposing a leadership be assembled.
TEAL'C
That is wise.
BRA'TAC
They wish both of us to sit on the council.
[Teal'c nods briefly.]
BRA'TAC
You know that will take you from the Tau'ri.
[Teal'c looks concerned. Bra'tac turns and puts his hand on Teal'c's
shoulder.]
BRA'TAC
Your purpose in joining them was to one day free the Jaffa. Now that
day is upon us. You must not abandon your people when we need you
most.
TEAL'C
Of that I am aware.
[Bra'tac pats Teal'c on the shoulder and turns to walk away. He stops
and turns back to look at Teal'c.]
BRA'TAC
The Council will preside from the new Jaffa homeworld, where a great
city is to be erected, a haven for all those who have chosen
freedom. Here, on the holy ground of Dakara.
[Bra'tac leaves.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel is sitting in the booth, looking around. Jim gets up from the
counter, holding a newspaper, and walks over to Daniel.]
JIM
Hey, I know you.
[Jim points at Daniel.]
DANIEL
Really?
JIM
Yeah. The guy from the paper, Doctor Daniel Jackson.
[Jim puts the paper down on the table, pointing to an article. The
newspaper is called The Ascended Times and the leader is entitled
"Jackson Still Undecided", with a large photo of Daniel. Daniel looks
at the headline, then back up at Jim.]
JIM
It's okay, keep it. I'm done.
DANIEL
Thanks.
[At the bottom of the front page of the paper, another headline reads
"Anubis plans to retake Dakara", with the additional headers of
"Exclusive information on his quest to destroy all life in the Milky
Way galaxy" and "He's back again and he's badder than ever." Other
headlines read, "Astral diner to be given infinite status", "Wraith on
their way to Atlantis", "Yoga, Not the path to enlightenment",
"Ethereal awareness seminar to be held in Talnak Quadrant." Daniel
reads the Dakara headline, then looks up, frowning.]
INT--SGC MESS HALL
[Carter and Jacob are sitting at a table, eating.]
CARTER
So, you gonna visit Mark and the kids this trip?
JACOB
Tomorrow.
[Jacob smiles at Carter.]
CARTER
Is everything okay?
JACOB
I'm just not very hungry.
[Jacob puts down his cutlery.]
CARTER
You've been pretty quiet.
JACOB
I'm fine.
[Jacob picks up a bottle of water and sips from it.]
CARTER
Dad...
[Jacob smiles.]
JACOB
What?
CARTER
It's been two hours since Pete left, you haven't said a word.
JACOB
I did so.
CARTER
'He seems nice'?
JACOB
I believe that's three words.
CARTER
I'm gonna marry him.
JACOB
I know. I just met him. What do you want me to say? I know how happy
he makes you. That's all that matters to me.
[Carter nods slightly.]
CARTER
Okay.
JACOB
Selmak really liked him.
CARTER
Selmak?
JACOB
Yeah, and he's a great judge of character.
CARTER
Well, okay.
JACOB
Look, Sam, I'm tired. It's been a long day. I think I'm gonna turn
in early.
CARTER
You sure nothing else is wrong?
JACOB
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
CARTER
Goodnight.
[Jacob gets up and Carter watches him as he leaves. She looks
concerned.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE DAY
INT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--BEDROOM
[The phone rings and a hand searches on the bedside table and the floor
for the phone. O'Neill, in bed, picks up the phone and turns it on.]
O'NEILL
What?
[He is obviously still half asleep.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Carter is on the phone, Teal'c standing behind her.]
CARTER
Sorry to wake you, Sir. Teal'c's back and it sounds like we have a
problem.
INT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--BEDROOM
O'NEILL
I knew it. Alright, I'll be there as soon as I can.
[He switches the phone off and drops it to the floor.]
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Crap.
[He sits up, turning to Kerry who has just woken. She stretches up
against him as he places his hand on her head.]
KERRY
What was that?
O'NEILL
Trouble in Jaffa-land.
[Kerry groans.]
O'NEILL
Gotta go.
[Kerry nods. O'Neill places his hand on the side of her face.]
O'NEILL
Sorry.
[O'Neill leans down to kiss her. He then gets up and Kerry looks at him
as he walks away.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel is reading the paper as Oma comes over to place a plate of
waffles on the table. He shows her Dakara headline in the paper.]
DANIEL
You know about this?
OMA
Yes.
DANIEL
And you're not going to do anything about it?
OMA
You know I can't.
DANIEL
Well, I'm certainly not going to just sit here and let this happen.
[Daniel stands and walks away from the table]
OMA
You can't leave, you're not ascended yet.
[Daniel stops and turns back to face Oma, obviously not happy.]
OMA
You walk through that door, you're choosing the alternative.
[Daniel looks at the door.]
DANIEL
You're saying I'll be dead.
OMA
Pretty much.
[Oma grimaces and nods her head.]
DANIEL
Okay. Ascend me.
OMA
It doesn't mean you'll be able to help your friends. You know the
rules.
DANIEL
Yes, but once I'm ascended, I can choose to take human form again,
just like last time.
OMA
Technically, yes, but you can't take that paper with you. You won't
have any of the knowledge that you've gained here, and good luck
ever ascending again. I'm certainly not going to help you a third
time.
DANIEL
So you're saying I can know Anubis is plotting to destroy all life
in the galaxy and all I can do about it is stay here and contemplate
my own enlightenment?
OMA
You can eat your waffles.
[Oma walks away. Daniel sighs.]
DANIEL
(loudly)
No syrup?
[He walks up to the counter and sits next to a woman eating pancakes.]
DANIEL
Hi, how's it going? I'm Daniel Jackson.
[He holds up the paper with his picture on the front page. The woman
ignores him. He sets the paper down on the counter.]
DANIEL
Sorry to bother you, I just wanted to know if I could borrow your
syrup.
[The woman turns a page of a book she's reading.]
DANIEL
Although technically, I know it's not going to be borrowing, 'cos
I'm not actually going to give back what I've used.
[Daniel smiles then grimaces. The woman continues to ignore him. Daniel
sighs.]
DANIEL
Enjoy your meal.
[He grabs the paper, gets up and walks over to a group of three men at
a booth. He slaps the paper down on the table.]
DANIEL
Hi guys! How's it going?
[The men ignore him. Daniel waves his hand in front of one of them. Oma
walks up to him.]
OMA
They're not going to talk to you.
DANIEL
Why not? Who are they?
OMA
Others. You're not one of them yet.
DANIEL
You mean Ancients?
OMA
A couple of them.
DANIEL
What are they doing here?
OMA
Watching.
DANIEL
Me.
OMA
Me too. I told you before, they're always watching.
[She holds up a jug of syrup.]
OMA
You wanted some motor oil?
[She hands the syrup to him and walks away.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Bra'tac, Teal'c, O'Neill, Jacob and Carter are sitting around the
table.]
O'NEILL
I still wish you guys had blown that thing up when you had the
chance.
CARTER
We had to at least be sure that all the Replicators really were
eliminated.
JACOB
And even though we apparently did get rid of them all in this
galaxy, there may still be more elsewhere that could be a threat
again.
CARTER
So, we wanted to try to figure out how the device worked in case we
ever needed something like it again.
O'NEILL
Great. Well, now the Jaffa have something that can blow up the
entire universe with the push of a button.
BRA'TAC
The Jaffa will defend Dakara with their lives.
O'NEILL
You want to explain to me why they don't want to wreck it?
BRA'TAC
The ruins at Dakara have become a symbol of freedom.
TEAL'C
Much more, the Jaffa believe that the device's power helped free
them, by destroying the Replicators. They also believe that
controlling this power will help ensure their freedom in the future.
O'NEILL
And get them virtually anything they want.
BRA'TAC
The Jaffa would never use it to that end.
JACOB
Jack is right. No-one should have that kind of power at their
disposal.
[Bra'tac sighs. Carter's mobile rings. She moves quickly to answer it,
slightly embarrassed.]
CARTER
Sorry! I thought I'd turned it off.
[She checks the display, turns it off, then grimaces. She puts the
phone back in her pocket.]
O'NEILL
So, we're all in agreement? One way or another, it's got to go.
Correct?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
BRA'TAC
If you are suggesting we destroy this device against the wishes of
the High Council, I must point out that would not be a good first
step in relations between the Tau'ri and the newly formed free Jaffa
nation.
[O'Neill looks at Jacob.]
O'NEILL
Why don't you do it? They already hate the Tok'ra.
JACOB
To be honest, a plan may already be in the works.
[Teal'c and Bra'tac look at each other, unhappy.]
JACOB
But as you know, Selmak and I aren't fully in the loop any longer.
O'NEILL
Mm.
[Harriman enters. He stands behind O'Neill and clears his throat.
O'Neill turns to look at him.]
O'NEILL
Yes?
HARRIMAN
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.
[He turns to Carter.]
HARRIMAN
Colonel? There's a call for you. Apparently it's urgent.
[Harriman leaves as O'Neill turns to look at Carter, who nods slightly,
looks at the others, then gets up. She is obviously embarrassed.]
CARTER
(quietly)
Sorry.
[She gets up, walks to a desk and picks up the phone.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Carter.
[O'Neill looks at Carter and raises his eyebrows.]
BRA'TAC
Teal'c and I have arranged another meeting of the Jaffa Council.
TEAL'C
Our hope is to continue strengthening the bond between previously
warring Jaffa by focusing on a common enemy.
[O'Neill looks over at Carter, who is standing with her back to the
room, still talking into the phone. She turns to look at the others
around the conference table.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Yeah, I know, it's just that it's not a good time right now.
TEAL'C
There are still many Goa'uld that remain a threat.
CARTER
(into phone)
I know, I'm sorry. I don't know, it could be an hour, it could be
all day. Yeah, okay. Yeah, me too. Bye.
[She hangs up the phone then turns back to the table.]
CARTER
Sorry about that, Sir.
O'NEILL
Emergency?
[All the men at the table have stood up.]
CARTER
No, no. Just a misunderstanding.
JACOB
Hey, weren't you supposed to meet Pete at the florist this morning?
[O'Neill looks up as Carter glares at Jacob.]
CARTER
(through gritted teeth)
No...Dad.
JACOB
No, I'm sure that's what you said. For the wedding.
CARTER
(through gritted teeth)
I know!
[She shakes her head at him.]
O'NEILL
Go ahead, Carter. It's supposed to be your day off, anyway.
CARTER
It's okay, Sir.
O'NEILL
Teal'c and Bra'tac are meeting with the Jaffa. There's nothing to do
around here. Go pick flowers!
[He smiles at her and leaves the room, while Carter sighs and glares at
Jacob.]
JACOB
What?
INT--DINER
[Oma walks over to Daniel's booth with a jug of coffee. Daniel, head
resting on his hand, is reading the paper. ]
OMA
More coffee?
[Daniel looks up.]
DANIEL
Sure.
[Oma fills his mug.]
DANIEL
Can you sit a minute?
OMA
Okay.
[Oma sits at the table.]
OMA
Ooh... how am I supposed to put it? 'Man, are my dogs, tired.'
DANIEL
That's good.
OMA
How are your waffles?
DANIEL
Best I ever had. Can you tell me why you stopped me from killing
Anubis the last time I was ascended?
OMA
Because if I didn't stop you, the Others would have. And they
wouldn't have been as nice about it.
DANIEL
You mean, they wouldn't have erased my memory and left me naked on a
planet?
OMA
That was your choice.
[Daniel simply looks at Oma.]
OMA
Okay, maybe not the naked part.
[Daniel smiles slightly.]
OMA
But I didn't totally erase your memory even though I was supposed
to.
DANIEL
There... okay. Why is it okay to break some rules, and not others?
[Jim enters the diner, whistling. He has another newspaper.]
DANIEL
Look, if you knew I had a problem following the rules the last time,
why offer me ascension again?
[Oma is watching Jim as he walks to the counter and sits down. He is
still whistling, loudly.]
OMA
Because I didn't want to see you die without at least giving you a
second chance. Look, I have trouble following the rules. I'm not
really supposed to help people ascend. You're supposed to do it on
your own.
DANIEL
But you do it.
OMA
I walk the line. Believe me, I crossed it a few times and paid for
it dearly.
[Oma glances at Jim, briefly.]
OMA
My point is, you just need to be willing to put your prior human
existence into the proper context.
[Jim is still whistling.]
OMA
Sorry, I've got to get back to work.
[She gets up and grabs the coffee pot. She walks past Jim and around
the counter.]
JIM
Coffee, please.
INT--PETE'S CAR--DAY
[Carter is in the passenger seat of the car, with Pete driving. She
gazes out of the window, looking pensive.]
PETE
Chocolate or vanilla?
CARTER
I'm sorry, what?
PETE
Chocolate or vanilla? The cake. Just in case you can't make the
meeting with the caterer.
CARTER
Oh, I'm sorry. I really do want to be a part of this.
PETE
I hope so. It's your wedding too.
CARTER
I know.
[Pete grins.]
PETE
I realise this must be weird for you. Worrying about place settings
when we could be destroyed by aliens at any minute.
CARTER
A little,
PETE
We're not about to be destroyed by aliens, are we?
CARTER
No.
PETE
Cos, you seem a bit distracted.
CARTER
I'm sorry.
PETE
So, your Dad like me?
CARTER
Of course! Why wouldn't he?
[Carter looks away and down.]
PETE
Tough guy to read.
CARTER
You just have to get to know him.
PETE
How about Selmak?
CARTER
Ah! He thought you were very charming.
PETE
For a human.
CARTER
Well, generally speaking, that's my type.
[They both smile.]
PETE
Good. Did I tell you I also have a surprise for you?
CARTER
No, what is it?
PETE
Tricky. You'll see.
[Carter smiles.]
INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is sitting behind his desk, with Bra'tac and Teal'c sitting in
front of him.]
BRA'TAC
The Council remains unwilling to destroy the weapon, for fear it
will weaken the resolve of the Jaffa to stand united against the
remaining Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
You realise we have to consider that thing a threat to our security?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
BRA'TAC
The Council recognises the danger and has decided to take action by
aggressively seeking out and killing Anubis. Once that threat has
been eliminated they will reassess the decision to destroy the
device.
O'NEILL
Well, we don't even know if Anubis can be killed yet, do we?
TEAL'C
We must not suggest to the Jaffa that he cannot be. At the very
least, we can eliminate the remainder of the forces of Anubis.
BRA'TAC
I believe this quest will unite many of the still fractured armies
by giving them focus on a common goal.
O'NEILL
Got anything to go on?
TEAL'C
Many of the Kull Warriors were killed in battle with the Replicators
but intelligence gathered indicates that Anubis may be marshalling
the remaining Kull Warriors on Tartarus.
BRA'TAC
A pre-emptive strike is being prepared.
INT--DINER
[Daniel pours sugar from a jar into his coffee. He turns to see Oma and
Jim speaking at the counter, Oma gesturing angrily. Oma's words are
indistinct. Oma walks away from Jim, into the rear of the diner. Daniel
walks over to Jim, who is stretching in his chair. A woman is sitting
at the counter two seats down from Jim. She is reading a book. ]
DANIEL
Hey.
JIM
Hey! Daniel. How's it going?
DANIEL
Do we know each other? I feel like I know you.
JIM
Call me Jim. We ran into each other last time you were ascended.
DANIEL
Ah. Nice to meet you, again.
[They shake hands and Daniel sits between Jim and the woman.]
JIM
Still haven't made up your mind, huh? Death or everlasting
enlightenment. I don't really see the choice, myself.
DANIEL
Of course, I don't want to be dead, it's just that...uh. Listen, the
reason I came over here was to ask you... why are you talking to me?
JIM
Oh, you mean because these other snobs won't even look at you. I'm
different, like Oma.
DANIEL
Really? Because I kind of have the impression that you two don't
quite see eye to eye.
JIM
What? That little... that was nothing.
[Jim looks quickly around to make sure that no-one is listening. He
moves closer to Daniel.]
JIM
(quietly)
We both operate somewhat outside the normal rules and regulations.
Sometimes we disagree on how far outside we should go, that's all.
[They both look at Oma as she steps up to take plates away from the
food counter.]
DANIEL
Really?
JIM
Yeah. As long as these other guys don't strike me down, I figure I'm
okay.
DANIEL
I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. I mean, I... I feel
like, if I agree to ascend, I'm signing a contract that I don't even
know what it says. Obviously, I had a little trouble with the fine
print the last time.
JIM
You sure did.
DANIEL
You know about that?
JIM
It's all out there.
DANIEL
I just don't see how I can agree to stand by and let Anubis destroy
every living thing in the entire galaxy.
JIM
Yeah, that's a tough one. Speaking of which, have you seen the
latest?
[Jim slides a newspaper over to Daniel. The headline reads "Secret Plan
Revealed. Anubis' dastardly plot to regain Ancient Weapon of
Destruction."]
JIM
He's a crafty one. Really knows the ins and outs of the rules.
[Daniel continues to read the article.]
JIM
I give him 3-1 odds to succeed. You want to know the irony of it
all? That device was originally used by the Ancients to create life
in the Milky Way. Well, recreate it, after the whole plague thing.
No kidding. Now it all gets undone with the push of one button,
leaving Anubis to recreate things all over to his own liking.
There's a waste of a million odd years of evolution, huh?
[He turns to the Others, seated around the diner.]
JIM
(yelling)
I say someone should really do something to stop him!
[The Others ignore him. Jim turns back to Daniel, waving his hand at
the Others in disgust.]
JIM
No-one will. Can I get a coffee?
INT--PETE'S CAR
[The car stops outside a house with a For Sale sign. Carter steps out,
her eyes closed.]
CARTER
Can I open them now?
[Pete walks around from the driver's side.]
PETE
Almost.
[Carter shuts the car door. Pete takes her hand and takes her forward a
few steps.]
PETE
Okay, now.
[Carter opens her eyes, then looks shocked. Pete smiles at her. They
are standing outside a large house. Pete has his hand on her back.]
PETE
What do you think?
CARTER
Uh, well, uh...
PETE
Speechless, huh?
CARTER
Yeah. Yeah
PETE
Isn't it great? Remember our first night together? You described the
house you always wanted?
CARTER
I can't believe this.
[They start walking towards the house.]
PETE
The kitchen isn't yellow, but we can paint. 'Come on, I'll show you.
[Pete walks on, leaving Carter in the middle of the lawn.]
PETE
And you're not gonna believe the back yard. The dog's gonna love it.
CARTER
Dog? Oh.
INT--DINER
[Daniel is still reading the paper.]
DANIEL
This is bad.
JIM
Yeah. This pie is great, and there's nothing to wash it down with.
[He upends his empty mug.]
DANIEL
Is there anything you can do to stop Anubis? I mean, you did say
someone should do something.
JIM
I did, didn't I. Well, as far as what can be done, it's kind of
complicated.
DANIEL
Yeah, so Oma tells me.
JIM
Yeah, well, I don't think she's told you everything.
DANIEL
What does that mean?
JIM
I'm saying...
[Jim looks uncomfortable.]
JIM
I've already said too much.
DANIEL
No, you haven't. In fact, you've hardly said anything at all.
JIM
You gave up eternal enlightenment, all the knowledge and power of
the universe. Why do you think you did that?
DANIEL
To fight for humanity, any way I could.
JIM
Yes, very big of you. You rejected everything Oma offered you, and
now she just gives you another chance? Based on the goodness of her
heart?
DANIEL
Well, that is the point isn't it? I mean, she is ascended, she is
good.
JIM
Sure, best intentions.
DANIEL
Do you know what happened between me and Oma? Why did I choose to
take human form again?
JIM
You should ask Oma.
[Daniel sighs.]
EXT--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--DAY
[Carter is sitting in her car staring at the house. She sighs, then
gets out and walks towards the house. O'Neill is in the backyard,
barbecuing. Carter walks around the corner of the house.]
CARTER
Hi, Sir.
O'NEILL
Carter!
CARTER
Look, I'm sorry to bother you at home like this, but um...
O'NEILL
How did you know I was here?
CARTER
I saw the smoke.
O'NEILL
Oh, yeah.
[O'Neill wipes his sweater and face.]
CARTER
Look, is this okay? I mean, I could have called first.
O'NEILL
No, yeah. I mean, it's fine. So, um... what brings you to this neck
of the woods on such a fine day, in my backyard?
CARTER
Well, actually, I've... ummm...
[Carter clears her throat.]
CARTER
I've been sitting in your driveway for the last ten minutes, trying
to work up the nerve to come and talk to you.
[O'Neill looks at her, eyebrows raised.]
CARTER
The truth is, I've been trying to work up the nerve for a lot longer
than that.
O'NEILL
Oh?
CARTER
Pete put a down-payment down on a house.
O'NEILL
Well, that's great!
CARTER
It's a beautiful house.
O'NEILL
But...
CARTER
The... the truth is, I'm having second thoughts about the wedding.
[O'Neill looks surprised.]
O'NEILL
Why?
CARTER
See, the thing is, the closer it gets, the more I get the feeling
that I'm making a big, huge mistake.
[O'Neill, looking slightly uncomfortable, glances into the house.]
O'NEILL
Look, Carter, I don't know what...
CARTER
I'm sorry to bother you with this, but uh, see, there's actually a
very good reason that I'm bothering you with this, and if I don't
tell you now, I might never...
[The back door opens and Kerry Johnson comes out of the house.]
KERRY
Jack, I looked everywhere, but I could not fi...
[Kerry sees Carter, who looks embarrassed. She turns to look at Kerry.
They both smile politely at each other.]
KERRY
Colonel Carter.
[O'Neill gestures at Kerry.]
O'NEILL
Miss Johnson.
CARTER
Yeah, I..I didn't...
O'NEILL
We were just meeting here, in my backyard on this fine day, to
discuss the state of affairs.
KERRY
Well, this is awkward.
CARTER
Ya think?
KERRY
Jack didn't want anyone at the SGC to know about... us.
CARTER
No! Look, I..I...uh...I'm sorry, this is my fault, I really, I
shouldn't have come by unannounced like this.
KERRY
Well, you know, now that the cat's out of the bag, you're here, why
don't you just stay? I'm sure there's enough charred meat on the
grill for all three of us.
[O'Neill gestures at Kerry with a burnt sausage.]
CARTER
No, thank you, I um...
[Carter's phone rings. She takes it off her belt and checks the
display.]
CARTER
It's the SGC.
[She answers the phone as Kerry walks over to O'Neill, who offers her a
beer. They look at each other, before turning to look at Carter.]
CARTER
Colonel Carter. What? When? Okay, I'm on my way.
[Carter switches off her phone then turns to O'Neill and Kerry.]
CARTER
I gotta go. It's my Dad.
[She runs down the steps and around the corner, O'Neill and Kerry
looking after her. They turn to each other, frowning.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel is sitting at the counter reading the Ascended Times. Oma walks
behind the counter and comes up to Daniel.]
OMA
Well, you can't stay here forever, you know. Actually, I suppose you
could, I just don't know why you'd really want to. Except for the
great service.
[She turns to get the coffeepot refills his mug.]
DANIEL
Look, obviously I don't want to just die. Don't suppose there's any
other options?
OMA
I can't get into it. What's stopping you from ascending?
DANIEL
I don't know.
OMA
Must be something holding you back, making you doubt yourself.
DANIEL
Maybe it's not me I'm doubting.
OMA
Look, whether you choose to accept living on a higher plane of
existence has nothing to do with me or anything that I can or can't
tell you. It's all up to you.
DANIEL
But there is something you're not telling me.
OMA
Is that what Jim said? You shouldn't be listening to him.
DANIEL
Why not?
OMA
Because.
DANIEL
Good answer.
OMA
Yes.
[Oma smiles slightly and walks away.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter walks into the infirmary.]
CARTER
Dad?
[She walks up to a bed. A nurse, who was standing at the bedside,
leaves.]
JACOB
I'm sorry, kiddo. We both are.
[Jacob is sitting up in the bed.]
CARTER
About what? What's going on?
JACOB
I don't want to ruin everything like this.
CARTER
Dad?
JACOB
It's Selmak. He's dying.
CARTER
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!
JACOB
It's okay. He's okay. He led a pretty full life.
CARTER
I didn't live with Jolinar that long, but I think I have some idea
of what it's like.
JACOB
Well, this is a little different, Sam. As you know, when a Tok'ra
symbiote dies, they can prevent their host from dying, as Jolinar
did with you.
[Carter nods.]
JACOB
The problem is, that last selfless act requires a certain amount of
energy and a conscious effort.
CARTER
What are you saying?
JACOB
By all rights, Selmak should have been dead weeks ago. I wouldn't
let him go. I thought we needed him, that I needed him to help you
stop the Replicators.
CARTER
Dad?
JACOB
He hung on as long as he could. Then he slipped into a coma just
after we activated the weapon on Dakara.
CARTER
You've known all this time, since then?
JACOB
I didn't want to spoil your wedding. Now, I thought we could make
it.
CARTER
(emotionally)
We?
JACOB
He's barely alive. I'm gonna die with him, Sam.
[Carter begins to cry.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel is sitting at the counter. Jim walks up and sits next to him.
He looks around.]
JIM
Where is she?
DANIEL
I don't know. Off doing whatever it is she does when she's not here.
JIM
You ask her?
DANIEL
Yep.
JIM
Wouldn't tell you.
DANIEL
No.
JIM
Had to find out for yourself last time, too. Man, were you pissed.
DANIEL
About what? Tell me.
[Jim looks around the diner then leans towards Daniel.]
JIM
What do you know about Anubis?
DANIEL
I know he's half ascended, whatever that means.
JIM
There are many planes of existence, between human existence and
ascension. Basically, the Others use their collective powers to keep
him from affecting anything on a grand, cosmic level.
DANIEL
But it's okay for him to destroy an entire galaxy.
JIM
It's okay for him to do anything he could have done, back when he
was a regular, old Goa'uld.
DANIEL
I see. What does this have to do with Oma?
JIM
Goa'ulds are bad. Anubis is as bad as they come.
DANIEL
And?
JIM
And?
DANIEL
And ascension requires that someone be pure of spirit. One must be
good to the very core to achieve enlightenment. So how does someone
like Anubis ascend?
JIM
Now he's getting it!
DANIEL
Oma helps people ascend but she'd never help somebody like Anubis!
JIM
Maybe not on purpose.
DANIEL
Are you saying he tricked her somehow?
JIM
Rule number one! No lone ascended being shall help a lower, ascend!
Lowers are what we call humans and such. If you deserve to be here
you should be able to get here on your own. If there's an exception,
for whatever reason, a majority vote by the collective can get you
in. But Oma thinks she knows better, and she's taken her licks for
it. I admit for the most part, she's brought good people onboard,
but as the old saying goes, nobody's perfect. Not even us higher
beings.
DANIEL
Oma helped Anubis ascend.
[Jim clicks his fingers and points at Daniel. Oma walks up to them,
angry.]
OMA
(to Jim)
Get out. Get out, now.
[Jim turns to her, than looks at his watch.]
JIM
Oh, look at the time. Gotta go kid, business to attend to. It was
nice talking to you.
[Jim pats Daniel's leg, stands and puts on his jacket. He glances at
Oma then walks away, whistling. Oma turns and glares at him as he
leaves the diner. She turns back to look at Daniel who is looking at
her, uncertain.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter is sitting at Jacobs bedside, holding his hand.]
CARTER
A number of the Tok'ra have responded. They want to pay their
respects.
JACOB
They can come.
CARTER
I can't believe there's nothing they can do. They can remove a
Goa'uld. In the last few years you've almost perfected the process
of saving the host.
JACOB
That process instantly kills the symbiote before it releases toxins.
It's too late for that, Sam. I'm sorry. I hate to do this to you,
but I should have been dead four years ago. Since then, I've been
all over the galaxy. I've done things most men never dream of.
CARTER
I've heard that before.
JACOB
I just want to know you're gonna be happy.
CARTER
I am.
JACOB
Don't let rules stand in your way.
CARTER
What are you talking about?
JACOB
You joined the Air Force because of me.
[Carter smiles.]
CARTER
I love my job.
[Jacob nods and puts his hand on her cheek.]
JACOB
You can still have everything you want.
CARTER
I do, Dad.
[Jacob sighs and looks at her fondly. Carter holds one of his hands in
both of hers.]
CARTER
Really.
INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is sitting at his desk, looking pensive. Kerry walks up,
knocking at the door. He turns to look at her and she walks in to the
office.]
KERRY
How's Colonel Carter's father?
O'NEILL
It doesn't look good.
KERRY
Sorry to hear that.
[She closes the corridor door.]
O'NEILL
Closing the door.
KERRY
Yeah, deeply symbolic.
O'NEILL
Really?
[Kerry sighs, smiling slightly at O'Neill.]
KERRY
I really like you. We're good together.
[O'Neill stands.]
O'NEILL
Yes. We are. But...
KERRY
You have issues. It's okay, we all do. There's just one big one in
particular that I don't think I can love with... live with. I need
to get out before I get more involved. We can still work together,
can't we? I'd hate to have to ask for reassignment. This is really
important to me. We agreed this would never affect the job.
O'NEILL
We did.
KERRY
Good.
[Kerry turns and walks to the door.]
KERRY
You know, there's just one thing I don't understand.
O'NEILL
Just one?
KERRY
Is the Air Force the only thing keeping you two apart? Rules and
regulations? Because if it is, you're making a very big mistake.
O'NEILL
And you know what I should do?
KERRY
Retire.
O'NEILL
Again.
KERRY
Don't get me wrong, you're considered invaluable to the program by
the Pentagon, but the President has appointed a civilian to run the
SGC before. Just a thought.
[Kerry leaves. O'Neill looks after her, pensive.]
EXT--SPACE
[The rebel fleet has gathered over Tarturus.]
INT--REBEL MOTHERSHIP
BRA'TAC
The time has come for this ancient warrior to fight one final
battle.
TEAL'C
I think not, old man. This victory will present us with many new
challenges that will require your wisdom and sound judgement.
BRA'TAC
What our people will require is a youthful, vital leadership, and
that is something others are better suited to provide.
TEAL'C
You are only as old as you believe yourself to be.
BRA'TAC
Talk to me in fifty years.
TEAL'C
Indeed I will.
[They look at each other, smiling.]
INT--DINER
[Daniel and Oma are sitting in a booth]
DANIEL
So it's true.
OMA
He tricked me.
DANIEL
How? You couldn't tell?
OMA
No. He must have found some old, Ancient research on ascension. When
he came to Kheb he knew what he was doing. When I realised the
horrible mistake that I had made I tried to undo it, but I couldn't.
That's when the Others stepped in.
DANIEL
I don't understand. They only sent him halfway back. Why not all the
way?
OMA
It's complicated.
DANIEL
Yeah, what isn't around here?
OMA
They warned him. He wasn't allowed to use any knowledge or power,
unless he otherwise would have gained it as a Goa'uld.
DANIEL
I don't understand. They let him wreak havoc. They don't care if he
destroys all life in the galaxy? Life, they themselves, created.
OMA
They haven't stopped me from continuing my work. I've tried to make
up for it, help when I can.
DANIEL
It's your punishment. You're forced to watch, powerless to
interfere, and let Anubis do whatever he wants, just to punish you.
OMA
I told you before. The galaxy you're from, the plane of existence,
is so small and insignificant compared to the rest of the universe.
DANIEL
I don't care. It's wrong.
OMA
That's what you said last time.
[Daniel gets up from the booth and faces the Others.]
DANIEL
(loudly)
Excuse me! Isn't it enough, already? I mean, a whole galaxy of
innocent people, enslaved and tortured for generations, now on the
verge of being destroyed, for nothing? For what? For one mistake a
good person made trying to do a good thing. Come on, the least you
could do is listen to me. That can't be against the grand high
fallutin' cosmic rules!
[All the diners ignore him. Daniel walks up to a man sitting in a
booth.]
DANIEL
(yelling)
Hey! I'm talking to you!
[Daniel grabs the man around the throat but he places his hands in a
bright light. Daniel steps back.]
DANIEL
Okay, okay. Well, I know you can hear me. Hasn't she suffered enough
already? Certainly, enough other people have suffered to punish her.
Don't you think you made your point?
OMA
That's the thing, Daniel. They don't. I keep breaking the same rule,
helping people ascend. That's why you're here.
[Daniel turns to face Oma.]
DANIEL
What if you stopped?
OMA
Wouldn't undo the problem. That's why I keep doing what I do. Anubis
can't be killed, not by you, not by me.
EXT--ANUBIS' BASE
INT--ANUBIS' BASE
[The rebel Jaffa have over-run the base.]
BRA'TAC
He is not here. No-one is here. The defences we fought through are
automated.
TEAL'C
We have been deceived.
BRA'TAC
Anubis fed us this intelligence to lure us here. Our forces
defending Dakara are depleted.
TEAL'C
We could not have known, brother.
BRA'TAC
You were right old friend. The device of Dakara should have been
destroyed at all costs.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY OBSERVATION ROOM
[Carter is sitting, looking down at Jacob. Two Tok'ra are at his
bedside, talking to him. O'Neill enters the observation room and sits
next to Carter.]
O'NEILL
You okay?
CARTER
(tearfully)
Actually, I'm fine. Good even, strange as that sounds. I thought I
lost him four years ago. Since then we've been closer then we ever
were my whole life. In a way, Selmak gave me the father I never
thought I'd know.
O'NEILL
Come here.
[O'Neill puts his arm around her. Carter holds the hand around her
shoulder.]
CARTER
Thank you, Sir.
O'NEILL
For what?
CARTER
For being here for me.

Always.

Oma and Daniel's booth. He sighs.]
JIM
Can I get a coffee?
OMA
Get it yourself.
JIM
Don't mind if I do.
[He walks away from the booth.]
JIM
Ooh, hey, Danny-boy, you see the paper?
[Jim places the paper on the counter and walks behind it to get the
coffeepot.]
DANIEL
No, what's it say?
JIM
The trick worked. Those stupid Jaffa took half their ships to hunt
down Anubis, meanwhile, his army was poised to attack Dakara. The
remaining rebel Jaffa guarding Dakara are being slaughtered. It's
only a matter of time before old Anubis gets his hands on the
weapon.
DANIEL
I'm sorry, you sound almost happy about that.
JIM
Who me?
DANIEL
Yeah. What do you have against Oma?
OMA
Daniel...
DANIEL
No, I want to know. I mean, you're not just watching, you're coming
in here to rub it in. Why are you taking such pleasure in her
punishment?
JIM
Me? I don't have anything against Oma. I think she's great, don't I?
[He looks at Oma who looks down, unhappy.]
JIM
Hell, she's the one that helped me ascend.
[Daniel looks at him in shock. Jim grins and points at Daniel.]
JIM
You got it now.
[Daniel stares at Jim.]
DANIEL
You are Anubis.
[Jim laughs and raises his mug to Daniel.]
JIM
Cheers.
[Jim continues to laugh.]
EXT--HOUSE
[Pete and Carter are sitting on a bench outside the house. The For Sale
sign has been changed to Sold.]
PETE
I knew from the beginning. Guess I just thought when you said yes
that... that you were worth the risk. Don't say I deserve better.
Can't get much better then you.
[Carter shakes her head.]
CARTER
That's not true.
PETE
I wish I could believe this had something to do with your father.
You needed some time to sort things out.
[Pete looks at Carter, who can hardly meet his eyes.]
PETE
I guess all I can say is, I hope you get what you want.
CARTER
That's it?
PETE
(angry)
What do you want? You want me to get down on my knees and beg?
CARTER
God, no, of course not. It's just, I thought you would react
differently.
[Pete is obviously close to tears.]
PETE
Bye, Sam.
[He stands.]

Sale sign.]

TEAL'C
The rebel fleet guarding Dakara has fallen to the forces of Anubis.
[Carter enters and walks up to them.]
TEAL'C
Bra'tac and the remaining rebel ships will not arrive in time.
Anubis now controls the weapon.
O'NEILL
Well, then we find the biggest damn nuke we can and we shove it
right through the gate. Now.
TEAL'C
Anubis will certainly have the gate shielded. The nuke will not
arrive in one piece.
CARTER
If we can dial the Alpha site we may be able to prevent the weapon
from connecting a wormhole to either planet. It may only buy us the
thirty eight minutes that the gate...
O'NEILL
Go, go, just go.
[Carter leaves.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Carter runs down the stairs from the briefing room. Harriman is at the
controls.]
CARTER
Sergeant, dial the Alpha site, now.
[The gate begins to turn.]
HARRIMAN
Wait a minute, that's not me.
CARTER
What?
[O'Neill walks up behind Harriman.]
HARRIMAN
I don't know.
[The Stargate activates.]
HARRIMAN
Incoming wormhole!
[The iris closes. Teal'c stands next to Carter.]
CARTER
That's not going to stop the energy from the weapon.
O'NEILL
If it is the weapon.
[The Stargate opens.]
HARRIMAN
No iris codes.
CARTER
We're too late.
O'NEILL
Self destruct.
CARTER
That's not going to destroy the gate, and theoretically there's only
a remote chance it would disengage an active incoming...
O'NEILL
Carter!
[He shakes his head.]
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Carter.
[O'Neill and Carter set the self-destruct.]
INT--DINER
[Jim is still behind the counter.]
JIM
Oh, you make a great cup of coffee.
[He puts the coffeepot away then walks to the front of the counter.]
JIM
Well, got to go.
[Jim waves at Daniel and Oma. Daniel looks to Oma, who simply sits
there. Daniel launches himself from the booth to attack Jim but he only
runs through him. Daniel stops, confused. He and Jim turn to face each
other. Jim smirks.]
JIM
There's nothing you can do. You don't have the power.
OMA
But I do.
[Jim turns to face Oma, who rises from the booth. A light engulfs her
and she changes from the waitress uniform into a dress. The Others,
sitting around the diner, turn to look at her in shock.]
JIM
You can't kill me either.
OMA
I can fight you.
JIM
Well, you can't win.
OMA
It won't matter, you won't be able to do anything but fight me back.
JIM
What are you going to do?
OMA
Something I should have done a long time ago.
[She walks towards him. Jim looks scared.]
JIM
Oh no, no. No!
[As Oma walks towards him she raises her hands. Jim raises his also,
and as the touch they are both engulfed in bright light. The light
forms into a ball which disappears through the ceiling. The Others are
watching, in as much shock as Daniel. Daniel walks to the place where
Oma and Jim were standing, and looks around in confusion. ]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The self-destruct time counts down from eight seconds. Harriman looks
on, tense. The timer suddenly stops at 1.26 seconds and the Stargate
closes.]
HARRIMAN
Wormhole disengaged.
CARTER
What's going on?
HARRIMAN
I don't know, it must be some kind of... system malfunction.
CARTER
That's impossible.
O'NEILL
Shut it off.
[Carter leans down to a keyboard.]
CARTER
Aborting self destruct.
[Teal'c and Carter look at O'Neill, who huffs out a breath.]
EXT--SGC COMPLEX DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, O'Neill, Bra'tac and Teal'c are sitting around the conference
table.]
BRA'TAC
The Kull warriors became disorganized and confused, as though they
no longer knew what to do.
TEAL'C
They no longer had a master to serve.
BRA'TAC
After that, they were easily defeated.
TEAL'C
Many Jaffa lost their lives at Dakara. Those that survived are
united as never before. And we are in agreement. The weapon must be
destroyed.
O'NEILL
Well, that's good.
BRA'TAC
A new memorial will be erected in its place, so that our triumph
over the Goa'uld will never be forgotten.
CARTER
I still don't quite understand what happened. One minute Anubis is
about to push the button that ends all life in the galaxy and the
next minute he's just... gone.
TEAL'C
Indeed, it is a great mystery.
BRA'TAC
One can only assume he was vanquished by some beings. If not, why
would he forfeit the weapon and his army.
[Carter and O'Neill look at each other.]
CARTER
You think?
O'NEILL
I do.
CARTER
It's the only thing that would explain the self destruct not going
off.
BRA'TAC
Of what do you speak?
TEAL'C
O'Neill believes that Daniel Jackson was somehow responsible.
DANIEL
(from nearby, muffled)
Nope, it wasn't me.
[Carter looks up in shock.]
O'NEILL
Anybody else hear that?
[Carter nods her head.]
DANIEL
I'm in here!
[All four turn to face O'Neill's office.]
O'NEILL
That's Daniel.
[O'Neill rises and walks over to the office doorway, where he suddenly
stops.]
DANIEL
Don't! Don't come in!
O'NEILL
Woah, hey there.
[O'Neill looks around and pulls down the SGC flag, holding it to Daniel
who is out of sight. Daniel grabs the flag as O'Neill looks around,
embarrassed. Daniel walks out of the office, the flag draped around his
lower half. Carter looks at him then turns away, her mouth open in
shock. Bra'tac and Teal'c stare at Daniel. Bra'tac smiles and nods his
head. O'Neill, who has been steadying the flagpole, also turns to look
at Daniel.]
DANIEL
It's uh... a long story.
[Carter looks up, still embarrassed. Daniel turns to look at O'Neill,
who looks away.]
EXT--LAKESIDE--DAY
[Carter and O'Neill are sitting on a small jetty outside a cabin,
fishing.]
CARTER
This is great.
O'NEILL
I told you.
CARTER
Can't believe we didn't do this years ago.
O'NEILL
Yes, well, let's not dwell.
CARTER
There are no fish in this pond are there?
O'NEILL
Nope.
[Carter laughs. Daniel and Teal'c walk around the side of the cabin,
carrying a cooler, two chairs and two fishing rods. They walk up to the
grass, next to the jetty and start to set up the chairs.]
O'NEILL
Nice.
[Daniel takes beers to O'Neill and Carter as Teal'c sits.]
