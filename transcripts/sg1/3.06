Point Of View
TEASER
INT--AREA 51, STORAGE ROOM
[Various alien artefacts are stored around the room. Suddenly, one of
them, the mirror Daniel found on P3X-233, switches on. Through it, a
long-haired Samantha Carter ducks, as Major Kawalsky shoots at an
unseen enemy.]
SAMANTHA
Major, come on!
[They are being shot at with staff weapons and Kawalsky returns fire.]
KAWALSKY
We gotta go back for the General!
SAMANTHA
I can't shut it down. I won't find this window again. We have to go
now.
[Kawalsky tosses a grenade down the corridor and runs towards her.
Together, they touch the mirror and vanish, rematerialising in the
storage room at Area 51. On the other side, Kawalsky's grenade explodes
and the mirror goes dark.]
KAWALSKY
You sure this is the right one to go to?
SAMANTHA
Anywhere's better than the alternative.
[She passes through a red laser, breaking the beam, and alarms suddenly
sound.]
KAWALSKY
Guess we'll see about that.
[They are quickly surrounded by armed soldiers.]
SOLDIER
Drop your weapons! Do it now!
[Samantha places the mirror's remote on the floor along with her gun,
and raises her hands. Kawalsky follows suit.]
SAMANTHA
I'm Dr. Samantha Carter from the SGA. This is Major Kawalsky. We
need to speak to your commander.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[O'Neill enters the infirmary, dressed in civilian clothes.]
O'NEILL
So, what's the big emer...?
[He pauses as he sees the alternate Samantha Carter lying in a bed,
with General Hammond standing at her side.]
O'NEILL
(to Samantha)
Whoa. What happened to you?
SAMANTHA
Jack.
O'NEILL
Jack?
SAMANTHA
It's me, it's Sam.
O'NEILL
Uh, yeah?
SAMANTHA
I never expected this variation. You're alive.
[Kawalsky enters the infirmary with Dr. Fraiser.]
KAWALSKY
Don't feel so bad, Colonel. Everybody around here is telling me the
same thing.
O'NEILL
Kawalsky?
HAMMOND
In a manner of speaking.
FRAISER
Actually, in a manner of fact, sir. This is Major Charles Kawalsky.
In almost every physical respect. His blood work, his dental
records...
KAWALSKY
(to O'Neill)
Except I'm not supposed to be alive in this reality any more than
you are in mine.
(to Samantha)
Sorry Sam.
SAMANTHA
It's not the same with us here, is it?
O'NEILL
Does...anyone want to let me know what the hell is going on here?
Anyone?
HAMMOND
They appeared a few hours ago in a Nellis High Security lock-up.
KAWALSKY
That quantum mirror you got locked up in Area 51? You guys never
figured out how to use it?
O'NEILL
(to Hammond)
Is he talking about that alternate reality thing Daniel futzed with
on 233?
KAWALSKY
Who's Daniel?
SAMANTHA
We can't be followed if that's what you're worried about. We brought
the remote through with us.
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
I have ordered the device sent here under heavy guard.
KAWALSKY
Where we come from, the Goa'ulds just took over the world, Colonel.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1, along with Hammond, are watching a recorded interview with the
alternate Samantha Carter.]
SAMANTHA
(on the television)
Look, I've told you this. Now let me talk to someone from the SGA.
INTERVIEWER
(off-screen)
SGA? There is no such organisation.
SAMANTHA
Well then you call it something else. The...Stargate Project,
Stargate Command...
INTERVIEWER
Stargate? What do you know about the Stargate?
SAMANTHA
(frustrated)
What do I know? Everything! We've been through this.
INTERVIEWER
Well let's go through it again.
SAMANTHA
For crying out loud. It's a big round thing. It takes you to other
planets. I made it work four years ago and we have been exploring
the galaxy ever since. That is, up until yesterday when the Goa'uld
came and started taking over every major city from orbit and making
slaves of the population.
[Hammond clicks the television's remote and the tape ends.]
CARTER
Oh my god. This is too weird.
O'NEILL
Yeah. How about that hair?
HAMMOND
She claims to have travelled from an alternate universe in the same
manner Dr. Jackson experienced a year ago.
DANIEL
Well this can't be the Dr. Carter I met in the alternate reality.
She's...dead?
O'NEILL
All right, just to clarify. This Carter is from an alternate,
alternate reality?
DANIEL
Apparently.
O'NEILL
Does anybody else have a problem with that?
TEAL'C
Which reality is actually real?
O'NEILL
Thank you Teal'c.
HAMMOND
She explains it.
[He switches the tape back on.]
SAMANTHA
(on the television)
Look, I know this is hard for you to understand. But according to
quantum theory, for every possible universe there are an infinite
number of variations, diverging in every choice we make, like forks
in the road.
INTERVIEWER
Uh-huh.
[Hammond turns the tape off once more.]
CARTER
She's right.
O'NEILL
You just agreed with yourself.
DANIEL
No actually, Major Carter just agreed with Doctor Carter. She never
joined the military in her reality.
O'NEILL
Fork in the road stuff?
DANIEL
Apparently.
O'NEILL
All right, so it's possible there's an alternate version of myself
out there that actually understands what the hell you're talking
about?
HAMMOND
They've asked to be debriefed. I'd like you all to participate.
(to an airman)
Show them in.
[The airman opens the door and Kawalsky, followed by the alternate
Samantha Carter, enters. Kawalsky is furious when he sees Teal'c
sitting at the table.]
KAWALSKY
What the hell is he doing here...?
[He starts to go for Teal'c, but halts when the airmen in the room draw
their guns.]
O'NEILL
Kawalsky!
DANIEL
(to Kawalsky)
He's a member of SG-1.
KAWALSKY
Who the hell are you?
DANIEL
Oh, um, I'm Daniel Jackson, also a member of SG-1.
HAMMOND
(annoyed, to Kawalsky)
Have a seat, Major.
[Kawalsky points at Teal'c as if shooting a gun before reluctantly
sitting down. The Carters come face to face in an awkward moment.]
SAMANTHA
Nice...hair.
CARTER
Uh, Air Force.
SAMANTHA
I can't imagine I'd go in the military.
CARTER
Wow. I can't imagine not.
[Samantha takes a seat next to O'Neill.]
HAMMOND
First of all, I would like to say we know what you've been through.
Dr. Jackson experienced a similar alternate reality some time ago on
a mission to P3X 233.
SAMANTHA
Well that's where we found our quantum mirror as well.
HAMMOND
Fortunately for us, Dr. Jackson was able to return with intelligence
that enabled SG-1 to stop the Goa'uld attack here on Earth.
SAMANTHA
Nice. That goes a long way to explain why yours was one of only a
handful of alternate realities that looked like it hadn't been
overrun by the Goa'uld.
CARTER
Actually, it's probably the very differences that set our universe
apart from yours that have contributed to our survival. Daniel's
participation in the Stargate program, Teal'c's change of heart, the
fact that I joined the military...
SAMANTHA
What? You think your being in the Air Force could have made that big
a difference?
CARTER
No, I just said it made a contribution.
SAMANTHA
(angrily)
And therefore I didn't.
O'NEILL
Ladies...Sams. We're all in this reality together.
HAMMOND
(to Samantha)
What we need to know is where you intend to go from here.
SAMANTHA
Our Beta site was instructed to bury their Stargate the moment the
last man stepped through. And our own world is under Goa'uld
control, so we can't go back.
KAWALSKY
We want to stay.
SAMANTHA
That is, if we're wanted.
[There's a long silence around the table.]
SAMANTHA
Look, we just left everyone we know, everyone we ever cared about.
If you're not going to give us a second chance, I don't know any of
you.
O'NEILL
Well exactly, you don't know any of us. And we don't know you. For
all we know you could be her evil twin. But then...we'd be dealing
with clichs and you know how I feel about those.
(to Carter)
No actually you know how I feel about those.
HAMMOND
Ok. I'll speak with my superiors and make a determination. For now,
you'll be assigned temporary accommodation.
(to the airmen)
Take them to A3 quarters.
[Samantha and Kawalsky leave the room.]
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[The alternate Samantha Carter is following an airman down the
corridor. Carter catches up to her counterpart.]
CARTER
Listen, I didn't mean to offend you back there.
SAMANTHA
Look, Major, I know I'm dealing with the inadequacy issues here.
Just forget about it.
CARTER
What?
SAMANTHA
We knew the Goa'uld were coming for six months, but I couldn't think
of a way to stop them. You did.
[She leaves Carter standing in the corridor as she continues on her
way.]
INT--SGC, A3 QUARTERS
[The airman opens the door and the alternate Samantha Carter enters the
room.]
AIRMAN
I'll be just outside if you need anything, ma'am.
SAMANTHA
Of course you will.
[She goes to the bed and sits down. She takes out a picture from her
pocket and sets it on the nightstand. It is a wedding photo of her and
O'Neill.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN (NIGHT)
[A military vehicle enters the Mountain's tunnel, while an armed airman
patrols the area.]
INT--SGC, HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is speaking on the phone, while O'Neill waits.]
HAMMOND
(into the phone)
Yes sir. I understand sir. Thank you sir.
[He hangs up the phone.]
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
They can stay.
O'NEILL
That was quick.
HAMMOND
Too quick. God knows what we're getting into.
O'NEILL
Well, the combined IQ of Earth might go up a few points having two
Carters around.
[Hammond doesn't appear convinced.]
O'NEILL
I take it you figure there's a downside.
HAMMOND
It just doesn't sit right. Some lines aren't meant to be crossed.
Nonetheless, I've been encouraged to find a way to incorporate them
into this Command.
O'NEILL
Ok. Um, in the meantime, do you want me to tell them?
HAMMOND
Very well.
[O'Neill leaves Hammond's office.]
INT--SGC, SAMANTHA'S QUARTERS
[There is a knock at the door and O'Neill enters. The alternate
Samantha Carter, lying on a bed, has obviously been crying. She doesn't
look round.]
SAMANTHA
Just put it on the table and close the door on your way out.
O'NEILL
(confused)
I'm sorry, put what on the table...?
[Samantha looks round in surprise.]
SAMANTHA
Jack. I'm sorry, come in.
[O'Neill closes the door.]
SAMANTHA
Your, uh, Dr. Fraiser keeps insisting that I eat something.
O'NEILL
Ah. Well, she's your Doc Fraiser now too.
(he smiles.)
You're in. They said yes.
SAMANTHA
That's good.
[She appears relieved, but nothing more.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, I can see you're overjoyed.
[She turns away from him and starts to cry.]
SAMANTHA
I just never expected this. It's so...so hard.
O'NEILL
Uh, look. I can't even begin to know what you've been through. I
know, uh,...I know you've lost a lot.
SAMANTHA
I lost you. I watched you die, Jack. Three days ago, trying to
defend the mountain. And here you are, alive and safe in this
perfect world, and you don't even know me.
O'NEILL
Well I...I sort of know you.
[He sits down beside her.]
SAMANTHA
You know her. You don't even see her that way, do you?
[He follows her gaze to the wedding photo.]
O'NEILL
I take it where you're from we were...
SAMANTHA
Married.
O'NEILL
Ah.
SAMANTHA
This makes you uncomfortable.
O'NEILL
No, no, not at all. I just...I get confused.
[There's a knock at the door and an airman enters with a tray of food.]
AIRMAN
Ma'am? Sorry, Colonel, I didn't realise...
O'NEILL
Just...put it on the table, airman.
AIRMAN
Yes Sir.
O'NEILL
Close the door on your way out.
[The airman leaves. Samantha gets up and goes over to the table where
the tray is set.]
SAMANTHA
I haven't had a hot meal in forever. Just a couple of weeks ago, we
were celebrating our first anniversary. Then we got the call that
the Goa'uld ships had been spotted entering our solar system. We
just left everything. You blew out the candles and I turned off the
oven. We just left. They didn't hit Colorado Springs from orbit like
most of the big cities, so the table must still be set.
O'NEILL
Cold by now.
SAMANTHA
Yeah.
O'NEILL
(rising)
Listen, um, I should probably be...
SAMANTHA
Stay.
O'NEILL
Sam...
SAMANTHA
Please.
O'NEILL
Look, you're dealing with a loss right now that I can't even begin
to...What I mean is, maybe I'm not the right person to help you.
SAMANTHA
Yes, you are. You're the only one who can. Look, I know you well
enough to know that you don't have clue what to say. You don't have
to say anything.
O'NEILL
Come here.
[He hugs her.]
SAMANTHA
(her voice breaking)
Oh, I miss him.
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill comes out of the alternate Samantha Carter's room. He meets
Carter in the corridor.]
CARTER
Sir. General Hammond told me the news. I took the liberty of
informing Major Kawalsky.
O'NEILL
Thank you. I was just on my way to do that.
CARTER
I thought I'd drop in on, uh...Samantha, see how she's doing.
O'NEILL
She's fine. I think she'd rather be left alone at the moment. Just
stop in tomorrow.
CARTER
Oh. All right. Goodnight, sir.
[She turns to leave.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
CARTER
(turning back)
Yes, sir?
O'NEILL
How are you doing with this...twin thing?
CARTER
Do you have a couple of hours?
[He thinks about it.]
O'NEILL
Ok.
CARTER
It...that was the answer.
O'NEILL
Oh.
CARTER
Goodnight, sir.
[She disappears down the corridor.]
O'NEILL
(to himself)
Goodnight, Major.
INT--SGC, SAMANTHA'S QUARTERS
[The alternate Samantha Carter is brushing her hair. She pauses and
drops the hairbrush, clutching at the table as her face starts to
distort.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[The alternate Samantha Carter is lying in a bed as Dr. Fraiser checks
her out. Carter rushes in to join Kawalsky and the other members of
SG-1.]
CARTER
What is it? What's happening?
FRAISER
Dr. Carter's gone into some sort of convulsive shock. I don't know
the cause and I don't know how to stop it.
(to Samantha, as she begins to seem distressed)
Easy.
[The alternate Samantha Carter starts to suffer the warping effect once
more. O'Neill and Kawalsky look on in concern. When it ends, Carter
hurries to her side.]
SAMANTHA
(to Carter)
Not medical. Temporal. Entropic cascade failure.
CARTER
On the cellular level?
SAMANTHA
Yes. I thought it would take years, not days.
CARTER
So it's a side effect of travel through the quantum mirror.
KAWALSKY
Then why don't I have it?
CARTER
I'm guessing Dr. Carter has it because I'm here. The increased
entropy generated by both of us existing in the same reality
might...theoretically be causing a temporal distortion.
SAMANTHA
It's not theoretical anymore.
FRAISER
Ok, so then how do I treat this?
SAMANTHA
You can't.
CARTER
The more time passes, the worse it should get.
SAMANTHA
So I'm going to die here.
O'NEILL
You're not going to die.
CARTER
Actually, sir...
O'NEILL
(cutting her off)
Carter.
CARTER
Well, the only way she won't is if we send her back.
KAWALSKY
If she goes back, the Goa'uld will kill her.
[The two Carters exchange a look.]
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill is tapping his pen on his paper, lost in thought.]
DANIEL
Think about it. Billions of people enslaved. I just can't help but
feel, in the grand scheme of things, we owe them. Besides, the only
way to really help Dr. Carter is to stop the Goa'uld in her reality
and...save whatever's left.
HAMMOND
How do you suggest we do that Dr. Jackson? The resources of their
entire world couldn't defend against the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
What about the resources of our world?
CARTER
What do we have that they don't?
DANIEL
Our fate. We made contact with the Asgard.
O'NEILL
So?
DANIEL
So, if Dr. Carter can make contact with the Asgard in her reality,
maybe their Asgard will be willing to help them.
HAMMOND
Defend their world against the Goa'uld?
DANIEL
Yes.
O'NEILL
And just how do you propose we raise the Asgard...in their reality?
DANIEL
Ok, we still have the dialling program that took you to the Asgard
home planet, right?
CARTER
Which we could download to a removeable hard drive. But that still
won't do it. Remember, in order to dial the Asgard home world, they
had to provide us with a generator that transferred extra energy to
the Gate's capacitors. I can't get it to work again. Apparently, it
was designed to work only once.
TEAL'C
Assuming Major Carter can figure it out, once in her reality it will
be difficult to get Dr. Carter to the Stargate without the Goa'uld
detecting and stopping her.
[Kawalsky appears at the debriefing room door.]
KAWALSKY
That's where I come in.
(to Hammond)
Permission to join the briefing, sir?
[Hammond gestures to the chair next to Daniel.]
KAWALSKY
(looking around the table)
I'll get her to the Stargate.
(as O'Neill and Hammond look at him)
What, you think I'm going to let her go alone? She's my best
friend's wife.
O'NEILL
You'll need someone to hook up the power generator.
CARTER
And download the dialling program.
TEAL'C
You will also require my assistance.
KAWALSKY
(to Teal'c)
We can handle this.
DANIEL
(to Kawalsky)
No, Teal'c has a point. You said yourself that Teal'c led the
assault on the mountain in your reality. Now, couldn't we use
something like that to our advantage?
O'NEILL
Quite the military mind, Daniel Jackson.
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
No, sir, I'm sorry. Teal'c can't go any more than I can...entropic
cascade failure. If I go, there will still be two of me in one
reality and the same will be true with Teal'c.
TEAL'C
Dr. Carter did not become ill during her first forty-eight hours. If
our mission is not complete within that time, it is most likely that
we will be dead.
O'NEILL
Good point.
(to Hammond)
Are you ok with all this, sir?
HAMMOND
If you feel confident you can pull this off, I have no objection.
However, upon your return I want that quantum mirror destroyed.
DANIEL
Ok, well this is all well and good, but none of us are going
anywhere unless we get that Asgard generator working again.
O'NEILL
Ok. Carter, download the program to the removable whatever it is,
and meet me and yourself, in the lab.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
INT--SGC, LABORATORY
[The Asgard generator is lying on a table. Carter lifts out a green
component.]
SAMANTHA
Well, this is incredible. If the Asgard could design this to give
the Gate extra juice, then they're just the little green men we're
looking for.
O'NEILL
They're grey actually. Roswell grey, to be exact.
[Samantha smiles.]
CARTER
You know, I had a hard time trying to figure out how to make this
work the first time, let alone make it work again.
SAMANTHA
If it's powered by the energy module of a staff weapon, why doesn't
it...?
SAMANTHA and CARTER
(in unison)
Blow up.
CARTER
My best guess is that the device creates a modulated dampening field
around the liquefied naquada cell.
SAMANTHA
Which controls the energy transfer to the capacitors. So maybe the
modulation is thrown out of whack each time it's activated.
CARTER
That's exactly what I thought. But how to you even begin to
recalibrate a field that you can't generate in the first place...?
O'NEILL
(cutting them off)
Hey, hey, hey! Are you Carters going to be able to figure this out?
SAMANTHA AND CARTER
(in unison)
We'll figure it out.
[The alternate Samantha Carter experiences the entropic cascade failure
once more.]
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
We have to figure it out.
INT--SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
[Kawalsky and Daniel are standing before the mirror. Kawalsky is
explaining to Daniel how the remote works.]
KAWALSKY
Ok, the way Dr. C explained it, the controller is kinda not what
you'd call an exacting science. You can't just dial up an address
like you would on a Stargate. You have to kinda figure out where you
are.
DANIEL
Well, it doesn't sound like a very expedient way to get home.
KAWALSKY
As long as you don't turn it off, it's always connected to the same
reality.
DANIEL
So when you turn it on again, it won't be connected to the reality
you came from.
KAWALSKY
Right. We'd have to find it again. Now this thing switches to the
various realities. If I turn it on now, it should come up somewhere
near the reality it was last on.
[He activates the remote and the mirror comes on, reflecting an
alternate SGC corridor.]
KAWALSKY
There, see? That's not it. No grenade damage. I...tossed a grenade
down the hall to slow them down so they wouldn't see us go through
the mirror.
DANIEL
So we need to find a reality that's just right. You mind if I...?
[Kawalsky hands him the remote. Daniel activates the remote. The mirror
reflects an Area 51 storage room.]
KAWALSKY
There. See, you probably turned it the wrong way. Now, since this
device should be in a storage closet in my reality, dial it the
other way.
[Daniel switches the mirror to another image of an SGC corridor. This
time, there are two Jaffa present. They see the mirror and level their
staff weapons.]
KAWALSKY
Change it, change it! Change it!
[Daniel switches the remote and the mirror changes to another SGC
corridor and this time it is empty.]
KAWALSKY
Ok, closer. What you want to do is dial it in smaller increments.
[O'Neill enters the closet behind them.]
O'NEILL
Daniel? You understand this thing?
DANIEL
I think so.
O'NEILL
Good.
CARTER
Colonel!
[The alternate Samantha Carter enters the room, followed by Carter who
is holding the Asgard generator.]
SAMANTHA
We did it!
O'NEILL
Already?
SAMANTHA
Yes, all we needed was the ratio of the decay rate of naquada
relative to the energy output.
CARTER
Which I learned to calculate when I learned about our new naquada
generator. It's just the ratio...
O'NEILL
(cutting them off)
Ah-Ah! It works, right?
[Samantha reaches over and flips a switch. The generator starts to
glow.]
CARTER
It works.
O'NEILL
Good.
KAWALSKY
Then I guess we better go do this.
INT--SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
[O'Neill, Daniel, Samantha and Kawalsky are there. The men are wearing
black Special Ops gear; Samantha is in her civilian clothes. Teal'c
enters the room, dressed to look like his alternate counterpart,
complete with a small beard.]
SAMANTHA
Yep, that's right, looks like him.
TEAL'C
I am not fond of wearing this uniform again.
KAWALSKY
Yeah, well I'm not too fond of seeing you wear it.
[Daniel and O'Neill are waiting by the mirror. It is showing an
alternate reality.]
DANIEL
I've searched through all the descriptions of realities close to
ours and this has to be it. It's the only one that's matching your
description.
KAWALSKY
Yeah.
[Carter enters the room and goes over to her alternate self.]
CARTER
Wish I could go.
SAMANTHA
Same here. But you don't want to go through a cascade trauma,
believe me. We made a good team, Major.
CARTER
Yeah we did Doctor.
SAMANTHA
Plus your...hair's kinda grown on me. Pardon the pun.
CARTER
You'd better go.
(to O'Neill)
I'll be here in case you need anything from this side, sir.
O'NEILL
Yep.
(he puts his cap on)
All right, on three. One, two, three...
[They all touch the mirror and rematerialise on the other side.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
[O'Neill, Kawalsky and Teal'c rush to the open door, taking cover
behind the walls. Daniel and Samantha duck down behind some crates, as
a troop of Jaffa can be heard coming down the corridor. O'Neill glances
over his shoulder and sees Carter in their reality standing by the
mirror. He signals Daniel to turn the mirror off, but Daniel shakes his
head. O'Neill is insistent and Daniel reluctantly switches the mirror
off. The mirror goes dark just as the Jaffa head towards them. A moment
later, the Jaffa head down another corridor, away from the storage
closet. One of the Jaffa comes back and glances into the room, but
doesn't see anything amiss. After he has gone, O'Neill signals for him
and Kawalsky to follow the group of Jaffa, while Daniel, Teal'c and
Samantha remain behind.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Kawalsky are trailing the Jaffa patrol through the
alternate SGC's corridors. There are a couple of dead SGC personnel
lying in the corridor, while sparks fly from dangling wires. The Jaffa
patrol heads into the Gate room, where a larger group of Jaffa have
assembled. They are led by the alternate Teal'c.]
AU TEAL'C
Jaffa!
[The group of Jaffa kneel as a bearded, alternate Apophis walks down
the gate ramp, flanked by two more Jaffa. Apophis surveys his Jaffa and
his eyes briefly glow. As O'Neill watches from his hiding place, the AU
Teal'c bows his head and Apophis leaves the Gate room.]
AU TEAL'C
Jaffa!
[The group of Jaffa get to their feet.]
AU TEAL'C
Kree!
[The Jaffa begin to file out of the Gate room, leaving the AU Teal'c
and a single Jaffa to bring up the rear. O'Neill tosses an object and
attracts the attention of the AU Teal'c.]
AU TEAL'C
Kel'nok.
[O'Neill signals to Kawalsky to head back down the corridor. The AU
Teal'c takes a staff weapon from the one remaining Jaffa.]
AU TEAL'C
Kel'noc Jaffa!
[The Jaffa runs off to warn the other Jaffa, while the AU Teal'c runs
down the corridor after O'Neill and Kawalsky.]
AU TEAL'C
Jaffa Kree! Jaffa!
[The AU Teal'c enters the storage closet and comes face to face with
Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
Kel'noc, Teal'c.
AU TEAL'C
(shocked)
Kel'shak?
TEAL'C
Renounce Apophis as a false god and join us in our deliverance of
this world, and I will spare you.
AU TEAL'C
Shol'va!
[The AU Teal'c prepares to fire his staff weapon. Teal'c fires first
and kills his alternate self. O'Neill and Daniel head over to Teal'c
and see the body of the AU Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
The idea was to zat him.
TEAL'C
As I said, O'Neill, ours is the only reality of consequence.
[O'Neill and Daniel exchange a look and O'Neill shrugs.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CORRIDOR
[As two Jaffa approach the storage closet, Teal'c emerges with Samantha
as his prisoner.]
TEAL'C
Jaffa, kree.
[He closes the door to the storage closet.]
TEAL'C
Kel toc no.
[He roughly pushes Samantha down the corridor ahead of him, followed by
the two Jaffa.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
O'NEILL
(to Daniel)
All right, I gotta know.
DANIEL
(about the mirror)
Yes, I'm about to activate it.
O'NEILL
No, no, no, not that. What the hell does 'kree' mean?
DANIEL
Well, actually it means a lot of things. Loosely translated it means
attention, listen up, concentrate...
O'NEILL
Yoo-hoo?
DANIEL
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
O'NEILL
Oh.
DANIEL
Ok, here goes.
[He uses the remote to activate the mirror. The other side shows an
empty laboratory and there is no sign of Carter.]
DANIEL
That's what I was afraid of. When I turned off the device, it lost
its place. I have to find our reality all over again.
O'NEILL
All right, it's ok. We knew that might happen. Stay with it.
[Daniel tries again, as O'Neill and Kawalsky leave the room.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Kawalsky head down the corridor once more. Kawalsky pauses
by a panel and places a charge against it, before moving out of the
way. O'Neill blows the charge and they enter a shaft.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CONTROL ROOM
APOPHIS
I will ask you this one more time, human. What is the address of the
planet to which your leaders have fled? The place you call Beta
Site.
[A Jaffa strikes a bloodied and beaten alternate Hammond with a device.
Hammond cries out in pain as a bolt of energy passes through his body.]
APOPHIS
(to Hammond)
Where have your leaders gone?
[Teal'c appears, with Samantha as his prisoner.]
TEAL'C
Kel Apophis.
APOPHIS
Teal'c, who is this?
TEAL'C
She was captured attempting an escape, my Lord.
APOPHIS
This one will not tell us the glyphs for the planet that they have
sent their leaders. Get it out of him. Or get it out of her.
TEAL'C
Yes, my Lord.
[As Apophis leaves, Teal'c drags Samantha forward.]
TEAL'C
(to the Jaffa)
Attend to our lord. I will take care of these.
[He takes the torture device from one of the Jaffa.]
TEAL'C
(when the Jaffa hesitate)
Kree, Jaffa!
[The two Jaffa bow and leave.]
HAMMOND
You might as well kill me.
TEAL'C
I would never do such a thing, General Hammond.
SAMANTHA
(to Hammond)
It's ok, you're not hallucinating. He's from an alternate reality.
[Teal'c and Samantha begin to untie Hammond.]
HAMMOND
So that mirror thing worked?
SAMANTHA
Yeah. Don't worry, I won't say I told you so.
HAMMOND
We should have tried it a long time ago, Doctor.
[Teal'c rises and watches one of the monitors. He sees a pyramid ship
coming down over the mountain.]
TEAL'C
They have landed on the mountain.
SAMANTHA
(to Hammond)
There's still a chance that we can stop them, sir. We're going to
attempt contact with a race of aliens that they have in their
reality, enemies of the Goa'uld.
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill pushes off a wire mesh covering and drops down into another
corridor, followed by Kawalsky. They both draw zat guns, before heading
down the corridor.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
[Daniel uses the remote and the mirror changes. In it, he sees two
Jaffa standing guard in a SGC corridor.]
DANIEL
Whoops, too far.
[He tries again and this time sees two Jaffa standing guard in Area 51.
He quickly switches realities once more as they level their staff
weapons at him. The next reality shows a captured SGC airman being
shoved down a corridor by a Jaffa. Daniel uses the remote again and
this time the reality is that of a beach with a pink and blue sky.]
DANIEL
Come on, please.
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, GENERATOR ROOM
[O'Neill breaks open a panel, then takes the Asgard generator out of
Kawalsky's backpack and begins to hook it up to the wires inside the
panel.]
KAWALSKY
Carters are pretty smart figuring that thing out, huh? So you and
Sam, you never had a thing in your world, huh?
O'NEILL
Sam is a Major in my world.
KAWALSKY
Yeah, I know, it's against regulations, right? You two looked pretty
good together, let me tell you.
O'NEILL
Kawalsky, during your Special Ops training in your world, did they
cover silence?
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
[Daniel is still attempting to find the correct reality in the mirror.
On the opposite side of the mirror, an armed Carter is waiting for them
behind a wall of sandbags.]
DANIEL
Yes.
[Carter comes round to the mirror, then slowly lowers her weapon.
Daniel waves to her. He then notices the label on her shirt says
Captain Carter.]
DANIEL
You're a captain.
[He waves goodbye and switches to another reality.]
DANIEL
Close.
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Samantha types something into the computer and the screen shows a
layout of circuitry.]
SAMANTHA
Ok, now.
[Teal'c inserts a handful of chips into the computer panel. A red line
appears on the computer screen.]
SAMANTHA
I hope your Jack is good enough to get the transformer online.
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, GENERATOR ROOM
[O'Neill flips the switch on the Asgard generator and is starts to hum.
He taps Kawalsky on the shoulder and they leave.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[The lights go out briefly, then come back on again as the Stargate
begins to dial out.]
TEAL'C
(answering Samantha)
It appears that he is.
[Hammond joins them at the console and checks his weapon.]
TEAL'C
You must prepare to go through the Gate, Dr. Carter.
[She rises, then pauses and reaches up to kiss Teal'c on his cheek.]
SAMANTHA
Thank you Teal'c.
[She heads down to the Gate room as the Stargate opens. Teal'c nods to
General Hammond, who puts down his weapon and places his hands on his
head, continuing the pretence that he is a prisoner. A Jaffa suddenly
appears in the Gate room and fires his zat gun at Samantha, who ducks
to avoid the shot.]
TEAL'C
(to the Jaffa)
Jaffa! Kree ho'nel! Ho'nel, Jaffa!
[The Jaffa is distracted. While he is looking up at Teal'c, Samantha
runs up the ramp and dives head first into the Stargate. It closes
behind her.]
APOPHIS
Teal'c.
[Teal'c and Hammond slowly turn around to face Apophis and his Jaffa.]
APOPHIS
(to Teal'c)
Why do you betray me?
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Kawalsky head down the corridor to the storage closet.
They break open the door to find the room filled with Jaffa, their
staff weapons pointed at a kneeling Daniel.]
JAFFA
Lower your weapons or we will kill him.
KAWALSKY
Colonel?
O'NEILL
Yeah, we should do that.
[They put their guns on the floor and kneel next to Daniel, while a
Jaffa kneels over the dead body of the AU Teal'c.]
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Teal'c, Hammond, O'Neill, Daniel and Kawalsky are kneeling before
Apophis. On the computer screen, they watch teh mothership landing on
the top of the Mountain.]
DANIEL
Deja vu.
APOPHIS
Who are you?
(to O'Neill)
My First Prime killed you before my very eyes.
O'NEILL
I'm feeling much better, thank you.
APOPHIS
(to Teal'c)
Then who are you? What magic is this?
DANIEL
Well you should know better than anyone there's no such thing as
magic.
APOPHIS
Trey lan tonik.
[One of the Jaffa prepares to zat Hammond.]
APOPHIS
I will ask you one more time, how could you have risen from the dead
without a sarcophagus?
[No one answers and the Jaffa shoots Hammond, who collapses unconscious
to the floor.]
O'NEILL
All right, I'm guessing the second shot kills in this world too,
huh?
APOPHIS
Tell me what I want to know!
O'NEILL
(to Apophis)
Hey, I'd love to. But I don't understand it myself.
(He gestures at Daniel)
He does.
DANIEL
Ok, I'll, uh, I'll give it a try. Um, you see, at every point in
time, there are infinite possibilities and uh, a parallel reality
exists for each possibility, so there are literally infinite
branches...
[Apophis nods to the Jaffa, who shoots Hammond a second time.]
KAWALSKY
No, you...!
[A Jaffa holds Kawalsky back as he lunges for Apophis.]
O'NEILL
Kawalsky!
[Kawalsky relents.]
APOPHIS
Tell me where you come from.
DANIEL
From an alternate reality!
O'NEILL
One in which, by the way, you're dead.
[Apophis nods and a Jaffa shoots Daniel, who falls to the floor.]
O'NEILL
Oh, come on...!
KAWALSKY
Aw, he's told you everything he knows...!
[As O'Neill watches, the Jaffa prepares to shoot Daniel for the second
time. Another Jaffa runs into the room.]
JAFFA
(to Apophis)
My Lord!
[The Jaffa rushes over to Apophis and bows.]
JAFFA
Tel kol, Apophis.
[He points to a monitor showing radar.]
JAFFA
Kree no tel. Reenlokia!
[On the monitor, a blip on the radar is moving in fast to their
location. O'Neill and Kawalsky help a recovering Daniel back up to his
knees.]
APOPHIS
Mel nok tee!
[The Jaffa bows and runs out. The Stargate can be heard dialing.
Apophis lifts his hand, preparing to use his ribbon device on the
prisoners, when a light suddenly surrounds him and he disappears, along
with the two Jaffa with him.]
O'NEILL
Ok, I'm guessing...
DANIEL
Asgard!
O'NEILL
All right.
[The Stargate opens and the remaining Jaffa run towards it to escape
the Asgard. Kawalsky watches, smiling. As the last Jaffa runs through,
the Stargate closes, slicing off the end of the Jaffa's staff weapon.
On the monitor, the Goa'uld pyramid ship can be seen leaving. The sky
darkens and the mountain begins to shake. As the rumbling dies down,
Hammond's body disappears in a flash of light.]
TEAL'C
It appears Dr. Carter was successful.
[O'Neill gets to his feet.]
O'NEILL
(about the Asgard)
Come on, you gotta love those guys!
[Samantha appears in a burst of light before them.]
SAMANTHA
I met the Asgard.
O'NEILL
We guessed that.
[Hammond appears behind Samantha, alive and unharmed. Samantha puts her
arms around him and kisses him on the cheek. O'Neill watches a monitor
showing an Asgard mothership appearing over the mountain.]
O'NEILL
(quietly)
Love those guys.
INT--ALTERNATE SGC, STORAGE CLOSET
KAWALSKY
(to O'Neill)
Colonel. It's been a pleasure to serve with you. Again.
O'NEILL
Likewise.
KAWALSKY
Right.
[Kawalsky salutes O'Neill, who returns the gesture. Kawalsky then turns
to Teal'c and salutes him. Teal'c bows his head in return. In the
mirror, Carter is watching the scene from their reality.]
SAMANTHA
(to O'Neill)
This is hard. Goodbye for a second time.
O'NEILL
It's the first time.
SAMANTHA
It doesn't feel that way to me. You have to understand, my Jack had
the same face, same voice...same hands.
O'NEILL
Which brings to mind an obvious question. How could you marry such a
loser?
[Samantha laughs and turns to Teal'c and Daniel.]
SAMANTHA
Thank you.
DANIEL
You're welcome.
[O'Neill silently gestures for Daniel and Teal'c to go through the
mirror. Taking the hint, they stand side by side as they touch the
mirror and disappear, reappearing on the opposite side. Samantha and
O'Neill stare at each other for a long moment, before Samantha reaches
up and kisses O'Neill. Carter, watching from the other side of the
mirror, appears uncomfortable and looks away. Samantha finally pulls
away from O'Neill.]
SAMANTHA
You're really not him, are you.
O'NEILL
No.
SAMANTHA
I just wish...
O'NEILL
Yep.
[He steps away from her and touches the mirror, appearing briefly on
the other side before it goes dark. Samantha is left standing alone in
the storage room with tears running down her face.]
