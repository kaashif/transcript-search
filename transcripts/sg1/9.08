TEASER
EXT--PLANET OF THE SODAN, P9G-844, DAY
[The team is walking on a path through a forest in single file, Teal'c
in the lead. They are all wearing black BDU's and carrying P-90's.
Teal'c stops and holds up his hand as if he has heard something.]
MITCHELL
(quietly)
What you got?
TEAL'C
Shh.
MITCHELL
(quietly)
Jaffa?
TEAL'C
Quiet.
(after a moment)
It is nothing.
[He begins walking again, and the others follow. Mitchell steps back to
walk alongside Daniel, with Carter right behind them. Mitchell is
chewing gum as he speaks.]
MITCHELL
(to Daniel)
He's not doing that on purpose, is he? You know, just to keep me
interested?
DANIEL
Well, that depends. Are you losing interest?
MITCHELL
Nah. We haven't found so much as a snapped twig on this planet, but
hey, to me it's all good, baby.
CARTER
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan are rumored to have a base
of operations here.
MITCHELL
Yeah, but Teal'c's intel came from a bunch of Jaffa he used to be at
war with. I know, old enemies, new allies and all that jazz, but
still...
CARTER
You think the information's bad?
MITCHELL
I think it's vague.
(in a voice mimicking a narrator)
A world once inhabited by Ancients. A village shrouded in the mists
of time.
(in normal voice)
Sounds like a movie trailer.
DANIEL
Well, we've found some pretty interesting things based on "vague".
MITCHELL
Yeah. Still, I'm getting that grasping at straws feeling.
DANIEL
Yeah, just don't tell Teal'c.
MITCHELL
I already did.
DANIEL
Yeah, what did he say?
MITCHELL
(imitating Teal'c)
The "Warriors of the Sodan" exists, Colonel Mitchell. I am certain
of it.
[Teal'c stops for a moment with a displeased expression but doesn't
turn back to respond to Mitchell.]
DANIEL
Needs more bass.
[Daniel and Carter walk past Mitchell while he pauses, looking around.
He hears a twig snap and sees a small branch move in a nearby tree. As
he looks around cautiously, a staff blast hits a bush behind him. The
rest of the team turns to see it.]
MITCHELL
(yelling)
Down!
[Many staff blasts start coming in, aimed at all of them. Mitchell is
positioned near a tree. Teal'c, Daniel, and Carter crouch behind a
fallen log, and they all start shooting toward the source of the staff
blasts, but no enemy is visible.]
MITCHELL
(yelling over the weapons fire)
Fall back to the gate. I got our six. Go, go, go!!
[Teal'c, Daniel, and Carter get up and go past Mitchell, back in the
direction from which they had been walking. They are firing heavily as
they move. Mitchell continues firing without retreating.]
MITCHELL
(to himself)
Where the hell are they?
[He turns and a Sodan warrior, Volnek, hits him in the face with the
handle end of a small staff weapon. Mitchell falls to the ground.]
EXT--PATH TO GATE ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[The rest of the team is on the move toward the gate but still under
intense fire. They stop and take cover in a shallow ditch next to the
path.]
EXT--SITE OF ATTACK ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Mitchell aims his P-90 at his attacker, but the warrior blasts it out
of his hand. Mitchell gets up onto his knees, draws his pistol, and
aims it at the warrior, but he is hit in the left side with a staff
blast. He falls onto his back, crying out in pain.]
EXT--PATH TO GATE ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[The fire-fight rages on.]
CARTER
(into radio)
SG-22, this is SG-1. We are under attack. We need backup.
(to Daniel and Teal'c)
Where the hell is Mitchell?
EXT--SITE OF ATTACK ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Volnek stands over Mitchell with his staff aimed at him, smiling.]
CARTER
(over radio)
Cameron, what's your position?
[Mitchell kicks out with his feet, tripping Volnek to the ground. They
stand up and begin fighting, and Volnek hits Mitchell repeatedly in his
wounded side. Volnek starts choking Mitchell from behind, but Mitchell
shoves him backward into a tree and elbows him hard. Free for a moment,
Mitchell moves on his knees, grabs Volnek's staff weapon, turns, and
shoots Volnek in the abdomen. (The staff weapon is smaller than the
typical Jaffa weapon, but has the same type of fire.) Volnek falls onto
his back. Then Mitchell sways and falls forward, unconscious.]
EXT--PATH TO GATE ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Teal'c continues to fire then stops when he realizes no one is firing
back, as do the others.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Cameron, do you copy?
EXT--SITE OF ATTACK ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Mitchell lies face down. Sodan warrior Haikon stands over him; several
other warriors stand nearby. One, Jolan, kneels to check on Volnek.]
JOLAN
His wound is grave, my Lord. His symbiote is badly damaged.
[Angry, Jolan approaches Mitchell and reaches for him. Haikon puts an
arm out, stopping him.]
HAIKON
No! Bring him.
[Jolan helps hoist Mitchell over the shoulder of another warrior. The
warrior activates a device, and he and Mitchell disappear. SG-22
appears on the path and comes in firing heavily. The warriors return
fire.]
HAIKON
Shal kree!
[The Sodan warriors retreat, leaving Volnek behind. Suddenly SG-22 is
firing into an empty forest.]
EXT--PATH TO GATE ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[The rest of SG-1 hears the firing and moves out toward it.]
EXT--SITE OF ATTACK ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[SG-1 joins SG-22. They peer at Volnek lying on the ground and are
disturbed to see that Mitchell is missing.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--VALLEY ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[A small village is situated in the valley.]
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[The village is rustic, with dirt streets, wooden buildings, and
oriental-looking accents. Two men are pulling a large cart by hand.]
INT--A SODAN HOME
[Mitchell lies on a slatted wooden bed, his head on a pillow made of
dried woven straw of some kind. His wounded side is red with blood,
visible through the hole in his tee-shirt. He slowly becomes conscious
and sees Jolan standing across the room, holding his staff weapon.
Haikon enters from outside.]
JOLAN
He will be dead by sunset, if not sooner.
HAIKON
Then, you must keep him alive.
[Haikon leaves. Mitchell loses consciousness again.]
EXT--FOREST ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Carter and other SGC personnel are searching the woods, their arms
drawn.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Carter to SGC. You got anything yet, Chief?
HARRIMAN
(over radio)
Colonel, we're reading UAV telemetry five by five. So far, no sign
of Colonel Mitchell.
CARTER
Let me know when you've completed your first sweep.
HARRIMAN
Affirmative. SGC out.
[A UAV flies overhead. Carter walks over to Daniel and Teal'c, who are
at the battle site. Medics are treating Volnek as he lies on a
stretcher.]
DANIEL
Anything?
CARTER
Not yet. How's he doing?
DANIEL
Not well.
TEAL'C
His symbiote is dying. If it is not removed, the host will die also.
CARTER
Sergeant, radio Dr. Lam. Let her know we have a Priority One medical
emergency incoming.
(to Teal'c, surprised)
No tattoo.
TEAL'C
He is a warrior of the Sodan.
DANIEL
According to legend, no Sodan has been indentured to a Goa'uld for
over five thousand years.
CARTER
So your intel was correct.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
SERGEANT
(over radio)
Colonel Carter, there's something you need to see.
EXT--NEAR AN ANCIENT OBELISK ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[A tall stone obelisk stands amidst the trees. It is covered with dead
vines.]
TEAL'C
This writing.
DANIEL
Ancient.
CARTER
Look familiar?
DANIEL
Nope. Teal'c?
TEAL'C
I have never before seen such a device.
CARTER
Well, I'm detecting energy readings. It's definitely some form of
technology.
TEAL'C
Perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
DANIEL
(reading the writing on the pillar)
Actually, that's exactly what it is. This says this is some sort of
aperture or gateway to...
CARTER
To where?
DANIEL
Enlightenment.
CARTER
Just enlightenment? Nothing more specific?
DANIEL
That's all it says.
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Warriors jog down the central path to the village. Large red banners
hang at intervals along the path. There is a single symbol on each
banner.]
INT--A SODAN HOME
[Mitchell is lying shirtless on the bed. Jolan is holding Mitchell down
as he works on his wound with a cloth.]
MITCHELL
(in great pain, arching up)
Gaahhh!
JOLAN
(pushing him back down)
Hold still!
MITCHELL
You know, your bedside manner totally blows.
JOLAN
Your wound is infected.
[He gets up and walks to a shelf to retrieve a pot of medicine.]
JOLAN
It must be cleansed or you will die. This will cause you a fair
amount of pain.
[He returns to sit on the bed next to Mitchell. Mitchell smiles for a
moment as if daring Jolan to continue. Jolan applies the medicine, and
Mitchell begins to writhe in pain.]
MITCHELL
Gaaahhh!
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Mitchell's screams are heard across the village.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--OPERATING ROOM OBSERVATION AREA
[Dr. Lam and others are operating on Volnek. Teal'c and Daniel are
watching from the observation area when Landry walks in. He places a
report in front of Teal'c.]
LANDRY
How's it going in there?
DANIEL
Touch and go. They've been at it for nearly six hours now.
TEAL'C
Most Jaffa would not survive such wounds.
DANIEL
Which means she's very good.
LANDRY
That's why she's here. Looks like you were both right about the
device he was wearing. More Ancient technology.
TEAL'C
(looking at the report)
A cloak of invisibility.
LANDRY
That explains how they were able to ambush you so easily.
DANIEL
What about the transporter?
LANDRY
Carter's with a team on the planet working on it right now. So far
they haven't been able to even open up the damn thing, let alone
turn it on.
DANIEL
Yeah, sorry I couldn't have been more help.
LANDRY
(sympathetic)
Well, one line of Ancient text isn't a hell of a lot to go on. We're
running surface scans with Prometheus on several moons and other
planets in the system.
TEAL'C
You believe Colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844.
LANDRY
It's a possibility. Ground sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up
empty.
INT--A SODAN HOME
[Mitchell is lying on the bed, a large green leaf covering his wound.
From outside is the sound of sticks hitting each other. Mitchell wakes
up and tries to sit up.]
MITCHELL
(in pain)
Oh!
[He lies back down and peels the leaf off of the wound, then rolls to
his side and sits up, putting his legs over the side of the bed. He
stands up, looks around, and takes a rust-colored homespun shirt from a
bench and puts it on. He looks out through the bamboo bars covering his
window to see men sparring in a raised sand pit. They are using long
wooden staffs to spar. He sees Jolan watching the warriors. He then
sees Jolan turn toward the building he's in. Mitchell grabs a
sharp-edged tool from a bench and hides behind the door as Jolan
enters. Mitchell shuts the door behind Jolan then grabs him from behind
and puts the tool to his neck.]
MITCHELL
Don't move. Don't make a sound. You call to the others, and it's
goodbye Jaffa.
JOLAN
(very calm)
It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.
MITCHELL
It certainly appears that way. Now, you're gonna tell me how I get--
[Jolan head-butts Mitchell, grabs him, and flips him onto his back,
taking the tool from him.]
MITCHELL
(on his back, rolling over)
Ahh!
JOLAN
How things seem and how they truly are, are two very different
things. For example, you are free to leave this place whenever you
choose.
MITCHELL
Oh, now you're telling me?
JOLAN
But to reach the Chappa'ai would take months on foot to the
mountains of Dor'ta'nak. No one who's attempted the journey has ever
survived.
[Mitchell gets partially up and leans against the side of the bed
platform.]
MITCHELL
So how did we get--
JOLAN
We were brought here through the Eye of the Gods.
MITCHELL
Which is?
JOLAN
Your questions can wait! Now that your strength has returned, we
should begin jomo se telek immediately.
MITCHELL
(standing up slowly)
Well, if that's breakfast, I could eat.
JOLAN
(grabbing him by the neck, choking him)
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior. Did you think our
mercy was without purpose?
(releasing him angrily)
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way
of Kel shak lo. Ritual battle with another warrior. And on that day,
you will die.
[Jolan exits, leaving Mitchell looking worried and running a hand over
his throat.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Lam sits next to Volnek's bedside. Volnek is restrained to the bed.]
LANDRY
I take it from all the beeping our friend is still with us.
LAM
That he is. Though how he survived is a mystery to me.
LANDRY
(walking around the bed to her side)
Oh, I'd say the nine hours you spent working on him might have
something to do with it. Nice work.
LAM
I did what I could to save it, but his symbiote was too badly
damaged. We had no choice but to remove it and start him on
tretonin.
LANDRY
As soon as he regains consciousness, I want to know.
LAM
Why? So you can interrogate him?
LANDRY
(chuckling)
Well, that might be more up Teal'c's alley, but that's the idea.
LAM
Well, that wasn't exactly the kind of post-op recovery I had in
mind.
LANDRY
Well, let me know the moment he wakes up.
LAM
Okay.
[Landry looks as if he wants to say something, but exits. Lam slumps on
her chair, exhausted.]
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Mitchell walks behind a warrior under a series of oriental-style
wooden arches. Different colored banners with Asian-looking symbols are
in view. The warrior escorts Mitchell to Haikon, who is seated on a
stone platform, apparently meditating. The warrior leaves him there.
Haikon awakens.]
MITCHELL
Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell. United States Air Force. Earth...
(after a pause in which Haikon does not respond)
I don't know if you know what's been going on out there, but things
are a little different now. The Goa'uld have been defeated.
HAIKON
The Goa'uld should have been defeated five thousand years ago. My
ancestors were one of the first of the Sodan. They were part of an
elite command force under the Goa'uld Ishkur. For years, they
pillaged and plundered under his name. Driving fear into the hearts
of all those that would oppose his rule. The further they ascended
among the ranks, the more they were able to discern the truth. That
he was not a god at all, but merely an imposter. Our true gods are
those that came before us.
[Haikon stands.]
MITCHELL
You're talking about the Ancients.
HAIKON
Ishkur branded my ancestors as traitors and ordered their deaths.
They tried to fight, to show their brothers the faith. But the odds
were too great, and they were forced to flee. They set out to find
Kheb, hoping that their souls would find peace. But instead their
search led them to this world.
[He stands near some stone tablets with Ancient writing on them.]
MITCHELL
You knew about the Goa'uld, but you didn't help the other Jaffa
defeat them.
(he pauses as Haikon walks slowly to his side)
Look, for the first time in their history, the Jaffa are free. But
it won't last without strong leadership. They need your help.
HAIKON
Their fate is of no concern to us. I hope you are prepared to die
well, Mitchell.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Volnek awakens suddenly and tries to sit up, but he's held back by the
leather restraints around his wrists and neck. Teal'c, who is looking
at a computer terminal next to Daniel, turns slowly around toward
Volnek and walks to his side. Daniel steps up next to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
You will not be able to break your bonds. We sought out the Sodan in
peace, wishing only to open dialogue. Instead, you attacked us and
took our comrade.
VOLNEK
All enemies who transgress our sacred ground forfeit their lives.
DANIEL
Yeah, well, you might want to post a few signs. Look, we just want
our friend back. And we figured your fellow warriors might want to
know that you're still alive and kicking. So, we're thinking
straight swap. Our guy in exchange for you.
VOLNEK
If your friend was taken, then mourn him. For if he is not yet dead,
he soon will be.
[Daniel appears frustrated and turns away for a moment.]
TEAL'C
Hear me when I say that all free Jaffa have always had the greatest
respect for the warriors of the Sodan.
VOLNEK
You speak of respect, yet you condemn me. Without my symbiote, I
will be dead soon enough.
TEAL'C
A medicine called tretonin courses through your veins. You have been
freed from your burden.
VOLNEK
Such a thing is not possible.
DANIEL
Oh, but it is.
TEAL'C
It is very real, I assure you. It is now used by several thousand
free Jaffa with no ill effects.
VOLNEK
Your poisons will not work. Had you any honor, you would have let me
die on the battlefield.
[Daniel looks at Teal'c, who grunts in frustration.]
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Mitchell and Jolan walk through the village.]
MITCHELL
So is it you just don't know what's going on in the rest of the
galaxy, or you really don't care?
JOLAN
The Jaffa made their choice five thousand years ago. Their affairs
are of no concern to us.
MITCHELL
Yeah, but how do you survive? At some point you gotta go hunting for
(gesturing to his abdomen)
you know.
[They arrive at a square area with a layer of thick sand on the ground
and racks of practice weapons. It is the training ring.]
JOLAN
We raid Goa'uld strongholds for shipments of symbiotes that have yet
to be implanted in any Jaffa. Such missions are rites of passage for
our youngest warriors.
MITCHELL
Well, it sounds like fun.
JOLAN
The fighting style of the Sodan has been a closely guarded secret
for a hundred generations. It is a shame you will die shortly after
learning it.
[He takes two long, wooden sticks with broader cylinders on each end,
and tosses one to Mitchell.]
JOLAN
Attack me.
[Mitchell sets the end of his stick onto the ground, unwilling to
participate.]
JOLAN
You find me an unworthy opponent?
MITCHELL
(picking up the stick again)
No. It's just I don't feel like--
[Jolan swings the stick at Mitchell, who ducks. Jolan catches him in
the back of the legs and tumbles him onto his front. Two children
watch, smiling. Mitchell laughs, then gets up and suddenly tries to
attack back. Jolan easily parries all of his advances, then pushes him
to the ground with a foot to Mitchell's stomach.]
MITCHELL
(slowly getting up)
Okay, let's try that one more time.
[Mitchell does better this time, but Jolan spins him and throws him to
the ground again.]
JOLAN
You are slow and undisciplined. If you fought your opponent today,
you would die without landing a single blow.
MITCHELL
(lying on his back)
And what happens if I refuse to fight? You just kill me?
JOLAN
It is an alternative you do not wish to explore.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Volnek sits with a full tray of uneaten food on the tray in front of
him. Teal'c enters.]
TEAL'C
Dr. Lam tells me you have refused to eat.
VOLNEK
The very odor of your food turns my stomach.
TEAL'C
If you are to survive without your symbiote, you require sustenance.
VOLNEK
It is only because your drug has weakened me.
TEAL'C
On the contrary, brother. It has freed you.
VOLNEK
What do you know of freedom, hmmm? You, who have served false gods.
Who chooses to live in this squalor rather than among his own
people.
TEAL'C
I know that I have heard stories of the Sodan since I was but a
child. Your bravery and skill are legend among all Jaffa.
VOLNEK
It is because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now.
Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies. Speak not of
skill to me.
TEAL'C
(emphatic)
Many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause that was started by the
warriors of the Sodan!
VOLNEK
And for what? Instead of respecting the traditions of our ancestors,
you would only seek to lead them further astray!
EXT--SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Various wagons move into the village. Nearby, Mitchell approaches a
bench with a bucket of water. He looks tired and sore. He drinks some
of the water with a spoon and pours some of it over his neck. He looks
up in surprise to see a Prior enter the village, followed by two
warriors.]
EXT--VALLEY ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
EXT--WOODS OUTSIDE OF SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Mitchell runs through the forest, down an incline, and turns left at a
tree with a red ribbon around it. He continues running and suddenly
hits an invisible obstacle that knocks him onto his back. It is Jolan,
visible once he turns off his invisibility cloak. He is holding a staff
weapon. He points back the way Mitchell had come.]
JOLAN
That way.
MITCHELL
Blue is left. Red is right. Got it!
[Mitchell gets up and starts running in the direction he should have
the first time. He hits an invisible Jolan again, again, and again some
time later. He hesitates at a tree with a blue ribbon on it. A staff
blast hits the tree. Jolan uncloaks, his staff aimed at Mitchell.]
JOLAN
Faster!
MITCHELL
Bastard.
[Mitchell runs off uphill, then through the woods to the end of the
course, marked by a wooden arch with several canvas sand bags hanging
from it. Jolan casually leans against the arch, waiting for him.]
MITCHELL
(breathing heavily)
How did I do?
JOLAN
(emptying a handful of sand onto the ground)
Badly. Again.
MITCHELL
Uh, yeah. You stop using that gadget, I guarantee you, I'll do
better.
JOLAN
A Sodan warrior must anticipate an attack at any moment.
MITCHELL
(referring to the invisibility device)
Yeah well, where'd you guys get those things, anyway?
JOLAN
The writings of our gods instructed us how to construct many of
their devices. We use them to protect our sacred ground.
MITCHELL
Speaking of gods, I know this is probably taboo, but I need to talk
to your boss. That visitor you had yesterday. I'm assuming it's not
the first time he's been here. I've met their kind before. They're
bad news. Look, I'll do any crazy training exercise you
want...within reason.
JOLAN
Finish the course in time, and I'll consider it.
[Jolan punches a hole in one of the filled sand bags. Sand begins to
drain from it.]
MITCHELL
You know, a bag of sand with a hole in it is not an accurate timing
device.
[Jolan points to the path from which Mitchell just arrived.]
MITCHELL
(setting off)
You are an evil man.
EXT--BALCONY OUTSIDE OF HAIKON'S HOUSE, NIGHT
[Haikon is sitting on the wide wooden railing, strumming a small string
instrument as Mitchell approaches. Mitchell looks exhausted.]
HAIKON
Please, sit.
MITCHELL
Ah, I'm good.
[Haikon indicates he needs to sit.]
MITCHELL
(lowering himself slowly for the pain in his legs)
Ohhh kay. Maybe I will sit. You know, I'm starting to get an idea
why you guys attacked us. That Prior's telling you we're enemies.
HAIKON
Is he wrong?
MITCHELL
You could have cut us down the second we stepped through the gate,
but you didn't.
HAIKON
Generations of my people fought and died under exile...praying for
the day when we could seek the path without recrimination. When we
prayed to the gods, did they hear us, Mitchell? Did they once give
us a sign as proof of their existence?
[Haikon slowly places his hand on a copy of the Book of Origin.]
HAIKON
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients. But can there be any doubt
that they are gods? And if they can lead us to the path of
enlightenment, how can I refuse them?
MITCHELL
You're making a big mistake. These Ori are not what you think they
are. They are not even close.
HAIKON
(calling to the warrior guards)
To kel shen!
HAIKON
Perhaps, when you face your death, in your final moments, you'll
understand.
MITCHELL
I've already been there. I understand.
[Mitchell walks away. Haikon picks up his instrument and begins to play
again.]
EXT--PRACTICE RING NEAR SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Jolan and Mitchell continue to spar. Jolan is holding a different
wooden weapon, with false wooden blades at either end, while Mitchell
is unarmed. There are several encounters, and Jolan gets the best of
Mitchell every time. The two children watch again, smiling at
Mitchell's ineptitude.]
JOLAN
(walking away)
You may rest now.
MITCHELL
No, I'm good, let's keep going.
JOLAN
(surprised)
You are not tired?
MITCHELL
Six weeks Airborne training at Fort Benning, that's tired. This is
nothing. Come on. If I'm gonna survive this Kel shak lo thing, I'm
gonna need to know a hell of a lot more than you're teaching me.
Quit pussy-footing around, and stop holding back. Let's go!
[Jolan takes a weapon like his from the rack and tosses it to Mitchell,
keeping the other for himself.]
JOLAN
You believe this staff is what makes you strong.
[They spar with the staffs, Mitchell trying to defend each stroke.
Jolan distracts Mitchell with a thrust of his staff, than uses his left
hand to strike. Mitchell blocks it with his forearm. Jolan smiles at
the stalemate. The watching children exchange smiling looks.]
JOLAN
The krantu is nothing but an extension of your body. No true warrior
depends on a weapon for strength or advantage.
MITCHELL
See, that's what I'm talking about!
[Jolan tosses a small leather bag to Mitchell.]
JOLAN
Drink.
[Mitchell takes the cap off of the bag and holds it up to his lips.]
MITCHELL
(grimacing as he drinks)
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.
JOLAN
Were it not for my teas, you would have died many days ago.
[Mitchell sits on a bench.]
MITCHELL
It was self defense, you know. The Jaffa I killed. It was him or me.
JOLAN
It does not matter. Blood has been spilled. Our laws decree you must
answer for it.
MITCHELL
So who was he?
JOLAN
His name was Volnek. A most skilled warrior.
MITCHELL
Look, for what it's worth...? There's nothing I can say, is there?
JOLAN
No.
MITCHELL
(standing up again, training krantu staff in hand)
So, who do I fight?
JOLAN
Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of your battle. Usually,
it is the closest blood kin to the slain warrior.
MITCHELL
Right. And the next of kin is just as tough as he was. Do I stand a
chance?
[Jolan looks doubtful but doesn't answer.]
MITCHELL
(putting his krantu back on the rack)
Never mind. I promise I'll die well and all that jazz. But before I
kick it, I gotta ask. You buying what these Priors are selling?
JOLAN
Lord Haikon has led us for more than a hundred years. He knows what
is best for us all.
MITCHELL
Yeah, yeah, look, I get it, you are a team player. I'm asking, what
do you think?
JOLAN
(approaching Mitchell, agitated)
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgment. Nor is it yours!
MITCHELL
Well somebody better, because if you guys follow the Ori, all of
your traditions, your krantu staffs, your precious path, your tasty
beverages, it's all going down the drain!
JOLAN
(taking the tea skin from Mitchell)
Enough! We're finished for the day.
[Jolan walks away, leaving Mitchell in the ring.]
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM
[Volnek sits handcuffed at a table, SF guards behind him. Teal'c
questions him.]
TEAL'C
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan...
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
[Landry, Carter, and Daniel watch on a monitor from the observation
room.]
TEAL'C
(on monitor)
and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.
VOLNEK
I walk the path of our true gods--
TEAL'C
The Ori are not gods! What did the Prior promise you? A place of
honor at his side, as heralds for your new masters?
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM
TEAL'C
(continuing)
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to
follow the path of Origin. That is the path you walk.
(menacing)
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter. No matter how
long it takes.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
LANDRY
This is going nowhere. Two weeks, and he hasn't given us so much as
a decent haiku.
CARTER
Well, it's understandable, sir. Most Jaffa would never break under
normal interrogation techniques.
DANIEL
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are an elite group of
warriors. I'm sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse.
LANDRY
What about the device?
CARTER
We haven't made much progress, I'm afraid. It seems the code
preventing us from using it is rigged to some sort of defense
mechanism. Dr. Lee received a few nasty volts while trying to
implement an override.
DANIEL
(closing his eyes for a moment)
How is he?
CARTER
Dr. Lam says the feeling should return to his legs in a few days.
LANDRY
Meanwhile, the International Committee is keeping score of all the
resources we're using to try to find Mitchell. Science teams,
orbital scans by Prometheus.
DANIEL
All of them coming up empty certainly doesn't look good.
LANDRY
Another few days, and they'll tell us to shut down search and rescue
operations.
[Carter is shocked, and Daniel stands up, also shocked.]
CARTER
Shut it down?! Sir, with all due respect, in the past we have spent
months searching for our people in the field. We can't just stop
looking.
DANIEL
What she's saying, sir, is we've never left a man behind.
LANDRY
(intense)
I'm more than familiar with the concept, Dr. Jackson. Give me
something I can use, soon, or the next paperwork I fill out will
declare Mitchell MIA.
EXT--BALCONY IN FRONT OF HAIKON'S HOUSE, DAY
[Haikon is dressed in purple silk vest-like robes. He stands in front
of a group of kneeling warriors. The Prior stands next to him. Haikon
goes to his knees and prostrates himself before the Prior. His warriors
follow suit, though Jolan hesitates at first. The Prior smiles.]
INT--HAIKON'S HOUSE
[Haikon's home is open to the outside. He crouches at a low table,
lighting candles. Mitchell comes running up and is stopped at the open
entrance by two armed warriors.]
MITCHELL
I just need a minute!
HAIKON
Let him pass.
[Mitchell enters to stand across from Haikon.]
MITCHELL
Thank you. All right, I'll make this quick. That Prior represents a
race of Ancients, yes. But believe me when I tell you, they are not
the Ancients you want to worship.
HAIKON
(standing)
The Prior has healed our sick. Caused our crops to grow as if by
magic. Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
MITCHELL
Look, their power is not what you should question. It's how they use
it. Anyone refuses to worship them, and they die. And I'm not
talking about a few non-believers here and there. I'm talking about
whole planets wiped out!
HAIKON
And I should simply take your word for this?
MITCHELL
You want to believe my people are godless and inferior? Go right
ahead. But we have never needed proof of our gods' existence in
order to believe in them. Faith. It was your faith that sustained
you for five thousand years, not the Ancients themselves. Don't
throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks.
EXT--TRAINING RING, DAY
[Jalon and Mitchell are sparring with the krantu staffs. Mitchell
appears much more skillful now.]
MITCHELL
Admit it! Haikon has totally lost his mind.
[Jolan gets the advantage and stops.]
JOLAN
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time. A fact you refuse
to accept.
MITCHELL
Got it.
[They spar again, and the encounter ends in a tie, with their sticks
crossed against each other. The children watching appear surprised and
a bit impressed.]
JOLAN
You may provide a challenge to your opponent after all, Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Followed by my violent death, of course.
JOLAN
Of course.
[Mitchell walks over to the rack and takes the bag of tea, holding it
up for a toast.]
MITCHELL
To my inevitable demise.
[He takes a drink.]
JOLAN
Why do you do this?
MITCHELL
Do what?
JOLAN
Train this hard. These are the last days of your life. I would think
you would spend more time in reflection.
MITCHELL
Well, all I know is, the moment you accept your fate, that's when
you're as good as dead. Till then, all bets are off.
JOLAN
You cannot survive Kel shak lo.
MITCHELL
Well, no offense, but I've endured things I wasn't supposed to
survive before, and I'm still here.
[Jolan looks around then steps closer to Mitchell, speaking more
quietly.]
JOLAN
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?
MITCHELL
(driving his training staff into the ground)
Because I've seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to
follow the Ori. Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to think, but
if everything I believed was being threatened, I'd want to know.
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM
[Volnek is again seated at the table, hand-cuffed. Daniel and Teal'c
enter. Volnek rolls his eyes.]
VOLNEK
You two, again.
DANIEL
Yes. Us two, again.
VOLNEK
Save your words. I am not in the mood.
DANIEL
We know how you feel. But we're not here to talk.
TEAL'C
You require evidence that the Ori are not to be trusted.
[A Jaffa named Tass'an enters, dressed in simple clothing and dirty.]
DANIEL
This is Tass'an. One of the founders of a free Jaffa settlement on a
planet called Sartorus.
TEAL'C
Many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they
fought so hard to achieve.
TASS'AN
He is Sodan?
TEAL'C
Indeed.
DANIEL
Tell him what happened.
TASS'AN
A month ago, a man came through the Chappa'ai. He called himself a
Prior. He told us of powerful gods called the Ori, who he claimed
would give us protection and show us the path to enlightenment. Then
he left. He later returned. Told us we had to make a choice. Follow
the Ori, or be destroyed. We chose to resist.
[He becomes upset. Teal'c pats him on the arm.]
TEAL'C
Continue, brother.
TASS'AN
He dialed the Chappa'ai and merely placed his staff in the ground in
front of it. Then the earth shook with a fierceness I have never
seen nor heard of before. In moments, our city was leveled. Hundreds
of our people wiped out in an instant.
VOLNEK
Enough of these lies! You expect me to take the word of this sorry
excuse for a Jaffa?
TASS'AN
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes! Heed my words,
brother. If a Prior visits your world, leave.
[Volnek appears interested but perhaps not convinced.]
EXT--BALCONY IN FRONT OF HAIKON'S HOUSE, DAY
[Warriors make their way up the stairs to the balcony. Haikon bangs a
large gong. Everyone goes silent. Mitchell and Jolan are dressed alike
in knee-length pants, boots, and sleeveless leather vests.]
HAIKON
(yelling for all to hear him)
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior, human! Do you deny
it?
MITCHELL
No, but it wasn't... No, I don't deny it.
HAIKON
If any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense, let them step
forward, now!
[Jolan steps forward.]
JOLAN
I seek it.
MITCHELL
(shocked)
You.
JOLAN
In the name of Volnek of Geshrel, my brother.
EXT--FORMAL FIGHTING RING, SODAN VILLAGE, DAY
[Mitchell and Jolan stand opposite each other, with Haikon between
them. Each holds a real krantu staff, with double-pronged metal blades
at each end.]
HAIKON
May the blood spilled here today settle this debt, once and for all.
[He steps back out of the ring.]
HAIKON
You may begin!
JOLAN
May you die well.
MITCHELL
Likewise.
[They begin fighting, swinging the blades at each other and defending
themselves. Each lands blows against the other's stick, or their body,
but without any wounds. Jolan knees Mitchell in the abdomen, and he
goes down for a moment. Mitchell then hits and kicks Jolan several
times, tripping him and knocking him to the ground. Jolan reaches up
with his krantu and cuts Mitchell in the leg. Mitchell cries out in
pain and stumbles to his knee, tries to get up, and stumbles again. His
vision becomes blurred. After a couple of parries, Jolan easily knocks
the krantu out of Mitchell's hands, steps up behind him and begins to
choke him with his krantu. Mitchell fights weakly, falls to the ground
against Jolan and slowly loses consciousness. Jolan drops him roughly
to the ground. After a moment, Haikon approaches and assures that
Mitchell is no longer breathing by touching him on the chest.]
HAIKON
The human is dead! The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
JOLAN
He fought and died a warrior, my Lord. It is only fitting he be
given the rite of Shel mak assah.
HAIKON
Very well.
[He gestures for other warriors to step forward, but Jolan stops him.]
JOLAN
With your permission, my Lord, I would like to take care of it
myself.
[Haikon nods.]
EXT--FOREST ON SODAN PLANET, DAY
[Mitchell comes slowly to consciousness under the arch at the end of
the training course. His neck is marked with the choking, and he has
several contusions on his face. He tries to sit up but gives up and
lies down again, groaning. Jolan sits against a post.]
JOLAN
(smiling)
I was afraid you would not wake.
MITCHELL
Well, maybe I shouldn't have. How long was I--
JOLAN
Seven hours.
MITCHELL
Seven? I thought it was only supposed to be two?
JOLAN
I may have inadvertently made the elixir too strong.
MITCHELL
Yeah.
(beginning to move)
Oh.
[He scoots backward to lean against the other post of the arch. His leg
is bandaged but clearly painful.]
MITCHELL
(touching his leg)
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar. So, did it work?
JOLAN
The ruse was most effective. They believe you are dead.
MITCHELL
Well done, Bones.
[Jolan looks puzzled.]
MITCHELL
Never mind. So, where does this leave you?
JOLAN
If the Prior intends to mislead the Sodan, as you say? Then I am his
enemy.
MITCHELL
And Haikon?
JOLAN
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake. But there are
several other warriors who feel as I do. We will continue to walk
the path of the Sodan, until the others see the error of their ways.
MITCHELL
Well, for what it's worth, you won't walk alone.
[Jolan nods, and Mitchell nods back.]
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[There is a knock at the door.]
LANDRY
Come!
[Daniel enters.]
LANDRY
How did it go?
DANIEL
Not well. Even after we showed him video footage of the damage,
Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori are responsible for what
happened on Sartorus.
LANDRY
What's he doing now?
DANIEL
Nothing. He hasn't said a word since Tass'an left.
LANDRY
Which puts us back to square one.
DANIEL
Yeah, basically. Teal'c seems to think that showing him more
examples--
HARRIMAN
(over loudspeakers)
Unscheduled off-world activation!
[The klaxons sound.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Landry and Daniel enter.]
LANDRY
What have we got, Chief?
HARRIMAN
Receiving an IDC, sir. It's Colonel Mitchell.
DANIEL
You're kidding.
HARRIMAN
I would never do that, sir.
INT--SGC INTERROGATION ROOM
[Teal'c enters to speak to Volnek.]
TEAL'C
You have a visitor.
[Mitchell and Daniel enter.]
VOLNEK
(standing up and coming around the table)
You!
MITCHELL
Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.
VOLNEK
(furious)
Oh, we have unfinished business!
MITCHELL
Just take it easy.
VOLNEK
You shot me!
MITCHELL
You shot me first!
VOLNEK
I will have vengeance!
TEAL'C
You will listen, brother.
MITCHELL
I know that you think we're enemies, and right now it doesn't matter
if we become allies. What matters is that you understand the truth.
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Harriman is dialing an address.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Volnek stands at the base of the ramp, waiting. Mitchell stands near
him.]
VOLNEK
You are fortunate my brother drugged you. You would never have
survived a true Kel shak lo.
MITCHELL
Don't know. Took you down pretty good.
VOLNEK
You were lucky.
MITCHELL
Lucky is good.
[The wormhole opens.]
VOLNEK
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.
[He walks up the ramp and turns around.]
VOLNEK
We will meet again.
MITCHELL
Looking forward to it.
[He bows slightly to Mitchell then enters the wormhole.]
FADE OUT
