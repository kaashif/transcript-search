TEASER
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Teal'c and Daniel are standing watching through the observation
window. Tech. Davis and Carter is seated at a computer. O'Neill
enters.]
TECH DAVIS
Chevron 6 encoded.
HAMMOND
Glad you could make it, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Wouldn't miss it, Sir. This is my favourite part.
TECH DAVIS
Chevron 7 locked.
[The Gate engages.]
CARTER
Proceeding with MALP transit.
TECH DAVIS
MALP en route.
O'NEILL
(studying Teal'c)
You look tense.
DANIEL
(looking at Teal'c as well)
No, I'd say anxious.
TEAL'C
I am neither tense nor anxious. Perhaps concerned.
DANIEL
Why?
TEAL'C
The address of this planet was procured from the repository of the
Ancients.
DAVIS
Receiving MALP telemetry.
[On the MALP monitor we see images of a platform with a ruined city in
the background.]
DANIEL
Nothing I can see resembles anything that we know about the
Ancients. Architecture, technology, writing.
CARTER
Maybe what we're looking at came to this planet after the Ancients
left it.
HAMMOND
Teal'c, do you recognise any of this?
TEAL'C
I do not, General Hammond.
O'NEILL
Nope, neither do I.
(everyone looks at him)
I'm just saying.
[On the MALP monitor, the MALP appears to have lifted off from the
ground.]
HAMMOND
What's it doing?
CARTER
Flying, Sir.
O'NEILL
MALPs can't fly.
DANIEL
Apparently they can.
O'NEILL
Shouldn't there be a memo on this stuff?
TEAL'C
I do not believe we are still in control.
CARTER
Run a systems diagnostic on the MALP.
[Tech. Davis starts typing in commands. A frequency reading appears on
a screen, then the video transmission by the MALP goes blank.]
O'NEILL
It's stopped transmitting.
CARTER
Negative Sir, we're still getting a strong signal. We should be
receiving video.
TECH DAVIS
Err...Major, you should take a look at this.
CARTER
Sir, very high frequency oscillations are being transmitted on a
feedback loop.
DANIEL
They may be trying to communicate.
O'NEILL
They?
DANIEL
Well, whoever they are.
O'NEILL
Exactly.
DANIEL
What?
CARTER
Sir, I recommend we disengage the Stargate and analyse this data
before proceeding.
HAMMOND
Agreed. Terminate the link.
[Computers around the control room start to spark.]
CARTER
Woah, we've got an EM spike. The system's overloading.
O'NEILL
Shut it down.
TECH DAVIS
I can't get in.
CARTER
Try override.
TECH DAVIS
Control systems are locked down
[Davis's computer explodes. He is thrown back from his chair. Carter
receives an electric shock from her computer.]
CARTER
The computer is no longer under our control.
O'NEILL
Emergency disconnect, Sir?
HAMMOND
Do it. Major, are you okay?
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
INT--GATE ROOM
[O'Neill and Teal'c enter. O'Neill pulls a large lever, shutting the
Gate down. Lights go out and the green backup lights come on.]
OPENING TITLES
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM.
[Fraiser is there with Tech Davis on a stretcher. The lights come back
on.]
FRAISER
Let's get him to the infirmary. He's got 1st and 2nd degree burns
Sir, mostly superficial. But I would like to run some more tests.
HAMMOND
Very well.
[Carter and Daniel move away from scorched equipment in the wall.
Carter's hand is bleeding.]
CARTER
The Stargate control systems and their redundancies are inoperative,
including the iris. The circuitry in these terminals has been
completely fused.
[Teal'c and O'Neill return from the gate room.]
O'NEILL
Any idea what that was?
CARTER
None, Sir. The secondary systems are up and running but that was one
hell of an EM spike. I'd like to run a full systems diagnostic on
the main computer.
FRAISER
Yeah, after I treat this hand.
CARTER
As soon as I get the systems up...
FRAISER
It is a very bad burn, Sam.
CARTER
Five minutes.
FRAISER
Now!
O'NEILL
Do as the Doctor says.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
FRAISER
Thank you Colonel. You, Daniel and Teal'c are next.
DANIEL/O'NEILL
What? We're...I'm fine.
FRAISER
Yeah well I would like to be the judge of that. Some form of energy
came through the Stargate. I think it's only prudent to make sure
there are no physiological effects to those exposed. ASAP.
[Fraiser leaves.]
O'NEILL
Who put her in charge?
HAMMOND
The US Air Force.
TEAL'C
In medical matters, Dr. Fraiser may overrule those of any rank.
[Teal'c walks off.]
O'NEILL
I'm not getting all my memos.
[Daniel looks at O'Neill and walks off. After a pause, O'Neill
follows.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[Carter is sitting on a bed getting her hand bandaged. Tech Davis is
lying down on a bed.]
FRAISER
Well, by the looks of the control room, I'd say you were both very
lucky.
DAVIS
I guess it could have been worse.
CARTER
I'd like to know what it was trying to do in the first place.
Unfortunately our best diagnostic tool for figuring that out has
been trashed.
FRAISER
You're all done here.
CARTER
Thanks.
[Tech Davis waves as Carter leaves. Teal'c enters.]
TEAL'C
Reporting as requested.
FRAISER
Thanks Teal'c. Just take a seat.
[On a monitor, images of x-rays of the human body start to flash up.]
INT--SGC, CARTER'S LAB
[Daniel and Carter are watching the MALP video playing on a flat screen
monitor.]
DANIEL
Can you freeze it just before it cuts out? I wanna get a video
capture of this hub thing. Might be able to cross-reference the
architecture. No, on second thought I don't think this place is even
remotely connected to ancient Earth.
CARTER
There. This is the start of the strange high frequency oscillations.
They began seconds after we lost video and started to multiply
exponentially. After that the oscillations maxed out our equipment
and made it impossible to measure them. Now, if I isolate this
smaller more detailed signal, and expand the timeline...there it's a
waveform of some kind.
DANIEL
The alien signal.
CARTER
Piggybacked on the MALP telemetry, that must be how it managed to
come back through an outgoing wormhole. I can't properly analyse it
until I get the computers back up. My hands are tied.
DANIEL
Well, there are other computers in the world.
CARTER
Not that I can access. General Hammond's put the SGC under
quarantine.
[The security camera turns to focus on them.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Techs are fixing burnt-out mother boards. Hammond, Daniel and Carter
are watching.]
HAMMOND
So information was accessed?
DANIEL
Apparently.
HAMMOND
Why? By what?
CARTER
We don't know, Sir, but it branched out through very specific areas.
Network and language software followed by system and application
software.
DANIEL
Learning to read, learning to talk.
CARTER
And knowledge of our systems.
HAMMOND
You're saying something was inside our computers?
DANIEL
Well, we're just guessing at this point.
CARTER
Whatever it was, we managed to interrupt it before it could complete
its entire scan of our computer.
HAMMOND
Were you able to determine anything further from the MALP
transmission?
DANIEL
Not a single reference on or off world that even remotely resembles
the architecture. It's...it's entirely alien.
[The security camera turns to watch them.]
CARTER
We're running a virus scan and purging the entire mainframe but it's
a long process. Our file allocation tables were corrupted by the
surge and there are sectors we'll never be able to recover.
HAMMOND
I'm maintaining DEFCON 2 and keeping the mountain locked down until
you can tell me with confidence there will be no further
repercussions.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
INT--SGC, MALP STORAGE ROOM
[The power to one of the MALPs comes on. A MALP starts to move of its
own accord.]
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM.
[Hammond, O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, Fraiser and Teal'c are seated at the
table.]
O'NEILL
So, it's a probe?
DANIEL
No we're saying it's like a probe. We actually don't know what to
call it.
CARTER
We do know that before we were able to cut it off a structured EM
wave managed to navigate over half of our computer system.
TEAL'C
For what reason?
DANIEL
Well, we sent a probe to their world.
O'NEILL
So we're calling it a probe?
DANIEL
Sure. The point is we don't know what would have happened if we
hadn't interrupted it.
HAMMOND
It did an awful lot of damage.
TEAL'C
Perhaps that was the intention.
CARTER
Or maybe it was intended to have been passive but just so advanced
that it overwhelmed our systems. We really have no way of knowing.
FRAISER
Now, what is this?
CARTER
Those are the high frequency oscillations we received. They're time
magnified and scaled for detail.
FRAISER
Looks like high amplitude tracings of an EEG.
DANIEL
Like a brain wave?
FRAISER
Yeah.
[The lights go off. The security camera moves. On the screen behind
Hammond, a realtime picture is projected of them all sitting at the
table.]
O'NEILL
Hello.
CARTER
It's still here.
O'NEILL
What, the probe?
[O'Neill rises and walks to the screen.]
CARTER
Whatever it is. It must have been sustaining itself within our
secondary systems while we were cleaning up the main computer.
O'NEILL
Do I look fat?
DANIEL
It's like it wants us to know that it's here.
[O'Neill throws a sloppy salute at the security camera.]
O'NEILL
Come here often?
[The image on the screen changes. Personnel files start to scroll
through until it stops at O'Neill's.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, all right, that's me.
[The security camera pans to Carter, and her file is displayed on the
screen. Daniel's is next up.]
[Siler enters.]
SILER
Beg your pardon, Sir, the dialling sequencer just went down.
HAMMOND
Take it off line, Sergeant.
SILER
Yes Sir.
[Siler pauses and looks at the screen, which shows real time the real
time security footage of him. Perplexed, he moves back to the control
room.]
DANIEL
It's learning.
O'NEILL
Learning what?
DANIEL
About us. Who we are, what we do here.
HAMMOND
Put a stop to it, Major.
CARTER
Yes Sir.
[Carter leaves.]
DANIEL
We don't even know its intentions.
HAMMOND
Doctor, I can't allow an alien technology into our computer systems,
whatever its intentions.
[O'Neill fixes his hair, using the camera and the screen like a
mirror.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill, Daniel and Hammond enter down the stairs. Carter is seated at
a computer. The security camera watches them.]
HAMMOND
Have we maintained quarantine?
CARTER
Yes Sir. For the moment, we're still isolated.
HAMMOND
I don't want to risk contamination of the outside world. I want
whatever this is stopped right here, right now.
[O'Neill starts moving from side to side in front of the camera. It
follows him.]
O'NEILL
I think it likes me.
CARTER
From what I can decipher, Sir, it's like a computer program:
incredibly invasive but as complex as a DNA strand, and it's
growing. It's eating more and more memory.
HAMMOND
Can you remove it?
CARTER
Well this will take a complete shutdown of all systems on base
connected to the mainframe, followed by a low level format of all
drives. Unfortunately Sir, any and all data not properly backed up
before this event will be destroyed. But it's the only way to be
sure.
HAMMOND
Understood. Do it.
CARTER
We'll be out of commission for a while, Sir.
HAMMOND
I've already alerted all off world teams to stay put until further
notice.
CARTER
Yes Sir. Sergeant?
SILER
Stand by for a base wide systems power down. Powering down.
[The lights and computers start to go off. The camera stops following
O'Neill's movements.]
O'NEILL
Hey.
INT--SGC, CORRIDORS AND ROOMS
[All lights go off. Green back up lighting comes on.]
INT--MALP STORAGE ROOM
[A MALP pulls out one of the emergency lights as it builds something
electronic.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Lights and computers are back up.]
SILER
All scans came back clean, Sir.
HAMMOND
Thank you, Sergeant.
CARTER
We may have only lost data from the last 24 hours before the event.
We'll know more when I can hook back up with the SGC archives in the
Pentagon.
HAMMOND
I'd like you and Sergeant Siler to double-check your results before
we do that.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
SILER
Major?
CARTER
You're kidding.
[On the computer screen, the MALP storage room is highlighted and
displaying a System Error.]
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[Siler and Carter are walking down the corridor. O'Neill rushes up.]
O'NEILL
Carter! Emergency lighting?
CARTER
In the MALP room, yes, Sir, a small power usage anomaly. General
Hammond said we should check it out before we resume normal
operations.
O'NEILL
Forget to change a light bulb, Siler?
SILER
Not my job, Sir. Yes sir, lightbulb, very amusing.
[O'Neill tries his keycard but the door doesn't open. After trying a
second time he touches the door.]
O'NEILL
It's warm.
CARTER
Fire?
SILER
Alarms would be going off by now, Major.
O'NEILL
It's been welded from the inside.
CARTER
By who? There's been nobody on this level since the power shutdown.
O'NEILL
Get a torch.
INT--SGC, MALP STORAGE ROOM
[The door is cut through with a torch. O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and
Daniel enter the room. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c have their weapons
raised. They follow a small mini-MALP through to a second area where
they see a mass of electronics, monitors and wires.]
O'NEILL
What is it?
CARTER
I don't know, Sir. I think we robbed the alien program of an
environment ,so it created one.
TEAL'C
It appears to be sustaining itself from the electric power from the
emergency light system.
CARTER
Must have got into the MALPs, survived on battery power while we
were shut down and built this memory mainframe while we were on
emergency power.
O'NEILL
Memory mainframe?
CARTER
I know for a fact that we wiped out a ton of it. This program must
use incredible compression; it must be able to reproduce itself from
a fraction of its original size. And now it's expanding into
whatever available memory it can find.
O'NEILL
Okay.
(into radio)
General, we're going to need some claymores down here.
HAMMOND
(over radio)
I'm on my way.
DANIEL
You wanna blow it up?
O'NEILL
Yes.
DANIEL
Why?
O'NEILL
Why?
CARTER
Sir, we've completely isolated this area of the base. There is no
chance of reinfection of our computer.
DANIEL
It's obviously fighting to survive.
O'NEILL
So do bacteria.
[A screen on the equipment shows Carter's personnel record.]
CARTER
It's trying to communicate.
O'NEILL
So do bact...
CARTER
Sir, I agree with Daniel. This is a life form, obviously
intelligent. Now we have been in the exact same position as this
alien entity I don't know how many times. On another planet, cut off
from our world, trying to stay alive.
[Hammond enters.]
HAMMOND
What in God's name?
O'NEILL
Well, General, whatever got into our computers apparently has built
a nest.
HAMMOND
Overnight?
CARTER
According to the security log there hasn't been any human activity
in the MALP room for over 36 hours.
O'NEILL
For the record Sir, I want to blow it to hell. These folks wanna
chat with it.
HAMMOND
Are you absolutely certain it can't reconnect to our computers?
O'NEILL
General?
[Carter points the light from her weapon to the emergency lighting.]
CARTER
It's surviving on an emergency circuit which is battery powered so
it's isolated from the rest of the base. We can kill it just by
severing that connection.
HAMMOND
How do you intend to proceed?
CARTER
Well Sir, it's provided an interface, I'd like to at least make
contact with it. If anything goes wrong, we cut the power.
HAMMOND
Very well.
[Carter approaches the keyboard and monitor in the centre of the
electronic mess. She types 'What is your purpose here?'. O'Neill takes
a pair of large wire cutters to the main power supply and waits. A
camera in the midst of the electronic mess turns to watch him. On the
monitor, the words 'What is yours?' appear in reply.]
DANIEL
Maybe it's trying to figure out why we sent a probe to its world.
[Carter types 'We are explorers'. The 'S' starts to repeat across and
down the screen.]
HAMMOND
Major Carter?
[Carter is staring at the screen, trembling. Electricity is flowing
from the keyboard over her hands.]
O'NEILL
Carter!
[O'Neill cuts the power supply. Everything goes black.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY
[Carter is wheeled in on a gurney surrounded by medics. Fraiser is with
her. O'Neill is following.]
FRAISER
Start an EEG and an EKG. Okay, on my count. 3,2,1.
[The medics lift Carter onto a bed. Hammond, Daniel and Teal'c watch
from the observation room.]
FRAISER
Are we in?
[The monitor for Carter flatlines.]
FRAISER
Charge the paddles 100. Take over.
[The monitor picks up a heartbeat.]
FRAISER
It's normal sinus rhythm. Sir?
O'NEILL
What? What is it?
FRAISER
These readings match those that infected the computer in the first
place. It's inside her.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY QUARANTINE OBSERVATION ROOM
[Through the window, O'Neill can be seen standing near Carter's bed
down in the infirmary quarantine room. Fraiser, Daniel, Teal'c and
Hammond are in the observation room. They are looking at readouts of
brainwaves on a computer monitor.]
FRAISER
These weaker readings are Major Carter's. These are the entity's.
DANIEL
How can a computer program be inside a human brain?
FRAISER
Sam said the entity was looking for memory within which to expand.
The human brain is capable of storing terabytes of information.
HAMMOND
How do you intend to remove it?
FRAISER
I doubt it's even possible, Sir. I mean more and more of her brain
is being stimulated, and it's impossible to tell whether her
memory's being suppressed, overwritten or erased entirely.
TEAL'C
General Hammond, I recommend Major Carter be placed under armed
guard.
DANIEL
What?
TEAL'C
If an alien entity has somehow invaded her body, then she is a
security risk and must be treated as such.
HAMMOND
I agree with Teal'c. The entity has fooled us twice. I'll be damned
if I let it do it again. She's to remain under guard at all times.
FRAISER
Yes, Sir.
INT--INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
[Carter opens her eyes.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
(to observation room)
She's conscious.
[Carter makes the sloppy salute mimicking O'Neill's from the briefing
room. Fraiser enters.]
O'NEILL
Can you talk?
FRAISER
Colonel, her PET scan resembles that of someone who has been the
victim of a stroke. Parts of her brain seem very active, others seem
dormant or suppressed. The entity does have complete motor control
however, it might be able to communicate with a speech synthesizer
if I explain its operation.
O'NEILL
Just concentrate on getting it out of her, will ya?
FRAISER
(voice breaking)
I don't know how, Sir.
O'NEILL
What about the Tok'ra or Asgard, don't they owe us a favour by now?
HAMMOND
'Til this situation is resolved Colonel, we're still under
quarantine. That means from our allies as well. We cannot risk the
entity leaving this facility.
INT--SCG, MALP STORAGE ROOM
[Siler, Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill are looking over the electronic
mess.]
SILER
Looks like it used a capacitor from the MALP to deliver a charge
right through the keyboard, Sir.
O'NEILL
Well don't touch it.
SILER
Yes Sir.
DANIEL
Sam said it was growing, expanding.
TEAL'C
Perhaps the entity that possessed her sensed that Major Carter's
mind was a more efficient memory storage vessel?
O'NEILL
It was a trap.
DANIEL
A trap?
O'NEILL
Yep. It was watching us the whole time.
DANIEL
Err... so you're saying it knew Sam and I wanted to make contact
with it?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
TEAL'C
And this device was created as a delivery system in order to invade
the body of Major Carter.
O'NEILL
Yes.
DANIEL
So basically what you're saying is...if we'd just listened to you in
the first place and blown it up...No seriously, I'm asking, is that
what you're saying?
TEAL'C
If we had destroyed the entity, Daniel Jackson, Major Carter would
not have been adversely affected.
DANIEL
Okay, look. I know your first instinct is to protect, both of you,
that's your job, that's what you do but...no matter what happens, no
matter how this turns out, Sam wasn't wrong to try to communicate
with it.
[Daniel leaves. O'Neill sighs.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
[O'Neill enters. The Entity speaks through a speach synthisiser
attached to a keyboard that Carter types into.]
ENTITY
O'Neill.
O'NEILL
That's right.
(To guard)
Go get the Doc.
(To Entity)
And you are?
ENTITY
I am within. You are O'Neill.
[Fraiser enters. Teal'c and Daniel join Hammond in the observation
room.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, we've established that.
ENTITY
This one has memory of you.
O'NEILL
The one you're talking about is a person. Her name is Major Samantha
Carter.
ENTITY
Then I am Major.
O'NEILL
No. No you're not.
FRAISER
We understand that you've taken control of Major Carter, but you're
not her.
ENTITY
There was no other choice. No other place to go. You wish to
terminate.
O'NEILL
Still do.
ENTITY
But you will not. Not now. I have observed. You value the life of
one.
O'NEILL
Yes we do.
ENTITY
This one is important.
O'NEILL
She is.
ENTITY
For this reason, this one was chosen. You will not terminate this
one in order to destroy me.
FRAISER
It went into Sam out of self preservation.
ENTITY
I cannot be removed from this mind without terminating. You will not
terminate this one.
(turns to the observation room)
None of you will. Therefore I will survive.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
FRAISER
The entity insists Sam's mind is intact, but I can't detect anything
beyond the barest trace. I believe even if I was somehow able to
remove it, she would be essentially brain dead
HAMMOND
I see.
DANIEL
Then why does the entity insist that Sam's mind is still within?
O'NEILL
It's the only way to keep us from killing it.
DANIEL
Or it's telling the truth, and we just can't detect it.
FRAISER
Yeah well, even if Sam is still in there somewhere, it won't be for
long. The entity's influence is still growing within her mind, and
there is nothing I can do to stop it.
TEAL'C
What course of action remains?
DANIEL
Well it wants to survive so we offer to send it home.
HAMMOND
This alien technology is capable of travelling back to us through an
outgoing wormhole. I won't risk the same thing happening again. I've
already ordered that the co-ordinates be locked out of the dialling
computer.
DANIEL
Let me talk to it. Maybe we can convince it to leave willingly.
HAMMOND
Very well, Dr. Jackson. Dismissed. Jack?
[Daniel, Fraiser, and Teal'c leave.]
O'NEILL
Sir?
HAMMOND
We may have to make some difficult choices. I know that Major Carter
means a great deal to you.
O'NEILL
She's a very valuable member of my team, Sir.
HAMMOND
Yes she is.
[O'Neill leaves.]
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
[Teal'c hands O'Neill a zat. Daniel and O'Neill enter the infirmary.]
INT--INFIRMARY OBSERVATION ROOM.
[Fraiser, Hammond and Teal'c are watching as O'Neill and Daniel enter
the room below.]
DANIEL
(through speaker)
My name is Daniel.
INT--INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
ENTITY
I am aware.
DANIEL
Right, you er...you read my file.
ENTITY
Yes.
DANIEL
Then you know I am a scientist.
ENTITY
Yes. You have determined I cannot be extracted.
DANIEL
Yes.
ENTITY
I will now offer information in exchange for continued survival.
DANIEL
We don't want your information. We want Sam.
ENTITY
Leaving this mind would cause termination.
DANIEL
You left that thing you constructed in the MALP room. Go back.
ENTITY
I have already grown beyond its capacity.
DANIEL
Why did you do this? Why did you come here in the first place?
ENTITY
You attacked.
DANIEL
No, we sent a probe.
ENTITY
Yes.
DANIEL
It's something we do to determine whether or not a place is safe for
humans.
ENTITY
Radio energy was emitted from your probe. Contagion. Much damage was
caused within.
DANIEL
Within what?
ENTITY
Within us. It spread before we understood it was poison.
DANIEL
You're saying your world was damaged by radio waves from one probe?
ENTITY
Yes.
DANIEL
We didn't mean to hurt you, it was a misunderstanding.
ENTITY
Yet it is done.
DANIEL
So you came here to, to what?
ENTITY
Preserve.
DANIEL
Preserve your world?
ENTITY
Yes.
DANIEL
How?
ENTITY
By destroying you.
O'NEILL
Well that's not going to happen.
ENTITY
Transmission was interrupted. If I had been able to complete
transmission, you would have been destroyed. My world would have
been preserved.
DANIEL
Well in a way, you succeeded. We won't go back there. You can repair
the damage we did, and we won't send any more probes through.
O'NEILL
Yes, we will.
DANIEL
Jack?
O'NEILL
We'll send dozens of them, one after another. I don't care what it
does.
ENTITY
No.
O'NEILL
Leave her...now.
ENTITY
You won't.
O'NEILL
You've read my file, think again.
ENTITY
I must preserve.
O'NEILL
Fine, stick to your guns then.
DANIEL
Jack?
O'NEILL
Daniel, we're going to do this my way.
ENTITY
You can't.
O'NEILL
General?
HAMMOND
You're damned right we can.
ENTITY
No, please.
O'NEILL
Leave her.
ENTITY
I must preserve.
O'NEILL
If you wanna preserve your world, leave Major Carter right now.
[Carter/Entity's hand shakes over the keyboard. She suddenly pulls the
wires from her head and jumps out of bed.]
O'NEILL
(to SFs)
Stand down. Let her go.
[Daniel and O'Neill, Hammond and Teal'c follow Carter/Entity. Fraiser
picks up the phone.]
FRAISER
We've got an emergency situation, code 649.
INT--SGC, CORRIDOR
[Carter/Entity is walking along. Two SFs stop her. She turns back as
O'Neill, Daniel, Hammond and Teal'c round the corner. Carter/Entity
raises her arms. Spikes of energy go from her hands to the ceiling.]
TEAL'C
I believe the alien is attempting to return to the mainframe.
[O'Neill shoots her with a zat. She pauses for a moment, then continues
to send the energy spikes, staring defiantly at O'Neill. He fires
again, and she collapses. Fraiser arrives. O'Neill and Fraiser go to
Carter/Entity where she is lying on the floor.]
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
[O'Neill is with Carter/Entity who is on life support. Fraiser enters.]
FRAISER
Still no change? I don't know if she ever told you this Colonel, but
Sam made a living will. No extraordinary means.
O'NEILL
Yeah, she told me.
FRAISER
There's no brain activity of any kind, no brain wave for either Sam
or the entity. She's being kept alive entirely on life support. I
think it's time to let her go, Sir.
O'NEILL
Just give it a minute, huh?
[Daniel and Teal'c enter.]
DANIEL
Just thought you should know, Hammond ordered the mainframe thing in
the MALP room destroyed in case the entity managed to find its way
back in there, it's probably what it was trying to do.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
TECH DAVIS
Sir we're go for a systems restart.
HAMMOND
Proceed Sergeant.
TECH DAVIS
Yes, Sir.
INT--MALP STORAGE ROOM
[Siler and two SFs are laying explosives in the MALP room.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
TECH DAVIS
All operational systems are back on line.
INT--MALP STORAGE ROOM
[The electronic mess suddenly powers up.]
SILER
Get back.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Sound of alarms.]
TECH DAVIS
It's the MALP room, Sir.
HAMMOND
(over speaker)
SG-1 to the MALP room immediately.
INT--SGC, INFIRMARY QUARANTINE ROOM
[Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c rise and leave.]
INT--MALP STORAGE ROOM
SILER
I think our friend is back, Sir.
O'NEILL
All right. let's blow it.
[On the computer screen in the middle of the electronic mess, the words
'I am here' appear.]
DANIEL
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[The words 'I am here' start to appear all over the computer screen.]
DANIEL
Look at this.
TEAL'C
The entity.
DANIEL
No. It said it couldn't go back. It's Sam.
O'NEILL
Daniel, I shot her twice.
DANIEL
After it transferred Sam's consciousness out of her body. You killed
the entity after it put Sam into this...this thing. She's in here.
O'NEILL
Why? Why would it do that?
DANIEL
You demanded it. You threatened to send an army of probes through to
its homeworld. Saving Sam and allowing itself to be killed was the
only way to preserve its homeworld.
[O'Neill picks up the phone.]
O'NEILL
Get me Hammond.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
HAMMOND
Hammond.
INT--MALP STORAGE ROOM
O'NEILL
General, we've got a situation down here.
HAMMOND
(over phone)
Same here, Colonel. I'm on my way.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[As Hammond exits, all the monitors in the control room have also been
scrolling 'I am here'.]
INT--SGC, MALP STORAGE ROOM
[Carter has been moved into the MALP room on her bed. The words 'I am
here' are still scrolling up all the computer screens in the room. The
EEG monitor has also been wheeled in. A nurse is assisting Carter's
breathing with a bag. Fraiser, Hammond, Siler, O'Neill, Daniel and
Teal'c are present.]
FRAISER
This EEG matches Sam's. I don't know how, but it's her.
HAMMOND
So what do we do?
FRAISER
There's nothing I can do, Sir, but to provide a conduit for her to
return into her own body.
[Teal'c raises his zat gun.]
TEAL'C
The entity has deceived us on several occasions.
HAMMOND
Go ahead, Doctor.
FRAISER
Yes, Sir.
[Fraiser flicks a switch and Carter jerks with the electric current.
All the computer screens go blank. Fraiser diconnects Carter from the
electronics. Carter takes a breath.]
FRAISER
She's back.
[Teal'c lowers his weapon.]
O'NEILL
Hey Carter, where you been?
CARTER
It's gone?
HAMMOND
Yes it is.
CARTER
I was shouting for you to hear.
O'NEILL
We heard.
