TEASER
INT--SGC--CONTROL ROOM
[The klaxons sound as Hammond and SG1, geared up for a mission, view a
MALP image of a domed structure on the computer screen.]
PA SYSTEM
Chevron four encoded.
HAMMOND
This is video the MALP sent back from P7J-989.
FEMALE TECHNICIAN
Atmosphere, temperature and radioactivity levels are ideal.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, this structure familiar at all?
TEAL'C
It does not appear to be of Goa'uld origin.
DANIEL
It looks pretty advanced.
CARTER
It's a possible a new source of information and technology, maybe
even an ally against the Goa'uld.
HAMMOND
Well, it's worth a try, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL SHOT
EXT--PLANET P7J-989--STARGATE
[The team step out into a green garden-like world and look around.
Flowers are in abundance around them.]
CARTER
Well, this is beautiful.
O'NEILL
Yeah, but where there's a garden, there's snakes.
DANIEL
And flowers. Ah choo!
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c start to walk off. Daniel follows.]
DANIEL
Way too many flowers.
EXT--PLANET P7J-989--DOMED STRUCTURE
INT--DOMED STRUCTURE
[A door slides open and SG-1 enter the domed building, weapons drawn.
There is tropical vegetation growing within, but it appears deserted.
As the team make their way further, they notice people encased in
chair-like apparatuses who appear to be in stasis. They are clothed in
dark robes and shrouded in dark veils. Tubes extend from the 'chair'
and are attached to their bodies.]
CARTER
I like what they've done with the place.
O'NEILL
I'm not so sure I like what the place has done to them.
[SG-1 take a closer look at the people in the devices.]
DANIEL
They're human.
TEAL'C
They are breathing.
O'NEILL
(referencing the chair-like devices)
All right, does anyone have any idea what these chambers might be?
CARTER
Some kind of medical device maybe, suspended animation of some kind?
[They continue to look around--they find four empty chambers.]
CARTER
Well, this is way past our science, whatever this is.
[The tubes in the chambers reach out and grab SG-1, tentacle-like. They
are each dragged into a chamber and after a struggle, tubes attach
themselves to their temples. They fall asleep like the others on the
planet.]

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--VIRTUAL EARTH--EAST GERMANY 1982
[O'Neill and Teal'c are standing in an open area outside a dilapidated
farmhouse or cottage. Daniel and Carter are not there. Both are dressed
in older military fatigues, sporting black knit caps, and are carrying
rifles. They look around at their surroundings, confused.]
TEAL'C
What is this place?
O'NEILL
Ah, I dunno. I can't put my finger on it.
TEAL'C
(Looking around)
It appears to be Earth.
O'NEILL
Yeah. Teal'c, what the hell just happened to us?
TEAL'C
We were exploring PJ7-989. We entered into a large domed facility
and endured some form of bodily attack.
[O'Neill raises his weapon as a truck pulls up. Teal'c does the same.
The vehicle comes to a halt and two men dressed in military garb
similar to O'Neill and Teal'c's exit the cab. One of the men is
Kawalsky.]
O'NEILL
(Weapon still raised, he is stunned at who he sees.)
Kawalsky? John?
MICHAELS
It's Colonel. You can lower your weapon, Captain.
[O'Neill looks from one man to the other, then he and Teal'c cautiously
lower their rifles.]
KAWALSKY
Why you acting so spooked, Jack?
O'NEILL
Maybe because I am. You're both supposed to be dead.
[Kawalsky and Michaels look at each other and grin.]
MICHAELS
That's real cute, Jack. Look, the intel on this one is good. They
keep Boris here during the day and take him underground at night.
Our bird confirmed on its last flyover: no snipers, it's only two
guards inside. It's a piece of cake. This ain't the one that you and
me die on.
O'NEILL
As a matter of fact, this is the one you die on.
[Michaels and Kawalsky look hard at O'Neill then move to get their gear
on. O'Neill turns to Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
(Quietly)
I went on this mission in 1982, East Germany. We were supposed to
grab a Russian agent from that house down there. It all went bad.
MICHAELS
You ready to move out or not, Captain?
O'NEILL
No, no, because this isn't real. It can't be.
MICHAELS
Oh it's real. It's very real. Your stalling here is putting the rest
of this unit in jeopardy. Now, let's move out.
O'NEILL
No. Because I'm either dreaming or hallucinating.
[Michaels punches O'Neill in the jaw.]
MICHAELS
Was that real enough for ya, Jack?
[Kawalsky looks on as he readies his weapon. O'Neill glances at Teal'c,
then back at Michaels.]
O'NEILL
(Nodding his head at Teal'c)
All right, how do you explain him? Does he look like a member of
this team?
[O'Neill pulls Teal'c's hat off. O'Neill stares, incredulous. Teal'c
has hair and his gold tattoo is gone.]
MICHAELS
Thomas has been on this team longer that you have. Now, you get your
head on straight, Captain. We are not aborting the mission this
late, do you understand?
[Michaels walks away. O'Neill hands Teal'c back his knit cap. He is
confused.]
O'NEILL
(To himself and/or Teal'c)
What the hell is this? What the hell's going on?
[Teal'c takes a look at himself in the cottage window.]
TEAL'C
I am as perplexed as you.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, do you think...Is there a chance those machines we were
sucked into were some kind of...I don't know...time machine or
something?
TEAL'C
It is possible. The Goa'uld have experimented with time manipulation
for years. Perhaps another race succeeded.
O'NEILL
So, it's possible this is real?
TEAL'C
You say this is a mission from your past that did not go well?
O'NEILL
Yes.
TEAL'C
Perhaps someone has given you the opportunity to alter your history.
[O'Neill thinks it over for a few seconds.]
O'NEILL
Okay.
[They rejoin Kawalsky and the team.]
O'NEILL
Let's move out.
MICHAELS
It's about time.
[They move out, eventually arriving at their targeted location. The
take up position outside the gated area of a large house, weapons
drawn.]
O'NEILL
(Whispers to Michaels)
Hold up. Let's not make the same mistake twice.
MICHAELS
(Low voice)
What the hell are you talkin' about?
O'NEILL
(Low voice)
Sniper on the roof.
[Michaels uses his binoculars and spots the sniper. He gives orders
using hand signals.]
MICHAELS
(Low voice)
Nice catch, Jack.
[The team's sharpshooter shoots down the sniper.]
MICHAELS
Let's go.
[The team continue to make their way slowly into the compound, using
hand signals to communicate. Kawalsky crawls on his belly to his
position behind a short stone wall, and on Michaels' signal, the team
shoot tear gas into the house through the glass window. Michaels crawls
over to O'Neill and Teal'c's position by the stone wall. He pulls on
his gas mask and gets ready to move out. O'Neill appears to be dreading
this.]
MICHAELS
Move now!
[Michaels leaps over the wall, and the team follow him. While they
hurry toward the house, the enemy rise up from behind a hedge at the
side of the garden and begin shooting. Michaels is shot. With Teal'c
providing cover fire, O'Neill goes to get John and pulls him to safety
behind the protection of a trailer filled with rock. He tries to help
his injured commander.]
O'NEILL
(Desperate)
Come on, John.
[O'Neill pulls Michaels' mask off. Michaels is bleeding from the mouth.
O'Neill holds his friend's head.]
MICHAELS
So much for satellite recon. Jack, take care of Barbara for me, man?
[Michaels gurgles briefly, then dies. O'Neill holds his friend for a
moment, grimacing, then takes charge.]
O'NEILL
Fall back!
[O'Neill joins the team as they all retreat, leaving Michaels where he
died. Kawalsky is right behind them. Teal'c and O'Neill jump over the
wall and duck down out of sight.]
O'NEILL
(Looking around)
Where's Kawalsky?
TEAL'C
He was immediately behind us.
[Suddenly, a truck pulls up in front of them. O'Neill takes aim.
Michaels and Kawalsky and the others step out of the truck just as they
had done earlier. The three men regard O'Neill and Teal'c curiously.]
MICHAELS
Lower your weapon, Captain.
[Disconcertedly, O'Neill looks at the man who'd just died then glances
back over the wall at the house where he'd left his body. Teal'c's
expression is a mask of confusion.]
FADE TO INT--VIRTUAL EARTH--NEW YORK MUSEUM OF ART C.1973
[Daniel and Carter find themselves in a room full of Egyptian artifacts
and are dressed in 70's period clothing. Both scan their surroundings,
confused.]
DANIEL
Okay, what just happened?
CARTER
I'm not sure.
[Daniel fingers the ties on his Dashiki shirt, as they look around.]
DANIEL
This place looks familiar.
[They wander around.]
DANIEL
(Realizing)
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is the New York Museum of Art.
I've been here many times. Many times.
[An exhibition is being set up off-camera. A voice is heard giving
orders.]
MELBURN
Okay, careful with that cover stone.
JAKE
Yes, Doctor Jackson.
[Daniel sees what's happening and moves toward it. Carter looks at
Daniel anxiously.]
DANIEL
(Incredulously)
No...
CARTER
Daniel?
MUSEUM WORKER
(To Daniel)
I'm sorry. This area isn't open to the public.
[Daniel brushes her arm aside, but doesn't advance much further. Carter
is by his side.]
MELBURN
Be careful with that cover plate.
[A stone structure is being set up. Pillars have been positioned
upright and a crane is lifting a large flat stone above the pillars. A
man and woman are standing beneath it. The woman is clutching a set of
blueprints, and the couple are directing the work being done.]
CLAIRE
Jake, it's swinging a bit.
MELBURN
Can you bring this thing on the left in a little more?
[Gaping in disbelief, Daniel just stands and stares at the scene.
Carter sees that Daniel recognizes something.]
CARTER
Daniel, what's going on?
DANIEL
(Ignoring her)
No, this can't be real.
MELBURN
(Out of sight)
Careful. Careful.
CARTER
Who are these people?
DANIEL
(Brief flabbergasted pause.)
They're my parents.
[His parents are still standing underneath the cover stone, directing.]
MELBURN
Move it towards the back, careful.
CLAIRE
Watch it on your left.
MELBURN
On your left. Jake, can we bring this in? Careful, bring it down.
Let's look at the front.
[The cover stone wobbles.]
CLAIRE
It's swinging.
MELBURN
(To Claire)
It's okay, it's fine, we'll be fine.
(To Jake) Careful.
DANIEL
(Distressed)
No!
CLAIRE
A bit more level, Jake.
MELBURN
Okay, Jake, let's bring it dow--
DANIEL
(Desperately)
Get outta there, Mom! Get outta there, Dad!
[The chain holding the cover stone suspended above them snaps. Screams
are heard as the stone falls onto the pillars, knocking them over and
crushing Daniel's parents beneath. Carter turns away from the sight.
Daniel shuts his eyes and drops his head, then looks up again, gasping
at what he'd just relived.]
EXT--VIRTUAL EARTH--EAST GERMANY
[O'Neill is positioned behind a tree. He moves to the next tree and
ducks behind it. Teal'c follows.]
O'NEILL
(Whispering to Teal'c)
This is too real, every detail, all the players are here. Why should
I go through this again?
TEAL'C
If someone has used an advanced technology to send us here to repair
your history...
O'NEILL
You see, that's just it--it's history. It's over. It happened. I
can't change it.
TEAL'C
Remaining here doing nothing will most certainly change nothing.
O'NEILL
(Thinking this over.)
I...oh God. All right.
[They move out from their positions. The sniper on the roof is spotted
and killed again. The signal is made for the tear gas to be fired
again. Michaels returns to O'Neill's side and puts his gas mask on.]
O'NEILL
Colonel, we should check those hedges.
MICHAELS
Negative. Stick to the plan, Captain.
[Off to the side, O'Neill notices people standing around. They are
dressed like the people in the chambers in the domed structure. They
are observing the events. O'Neill points them out to Teal'c, who sees
them, too.]
MICHAELS
Move now!
[The team move out and head for the house. However, O'Neill pulls
Michaels down and behind the cover of the trailer with the stones.]
MICHAELS
Jack, what are you doing?
[O'Neill rises up and shoots at the hedges, where the gunmen were
before.]
MICHAELS
That is not part of the plan.
[Michaels runs out and heads for the house.]
O'NEILL
John!
[The enemy rise up from the behind the roofline of the house and open
fire. Michaels is shot. Teal'c again provides cover while O'Neill goes
back to retrieve Michaels, dragging him back behind the trailer. As
before, he removes Michaels' gasmask.]
O'NEILL
Come on, John.
MICHAELS
So much for satellite recon. Jack, take care of Barbara for me, man?
[As before, he gurgles and dies.]
O'NEILL
(Under his breath)
Oh God.
(To the team)
Fall back!
[O'Neill and Teal'c retreat to their earlier position over the wall, as
the people in black look on. A vehicle pulling up draws O'Neill's
attention, and he and Teal'c take aim. It's the same truck carrying
Michaels and Kawalsky and the rest of the squad again. They exit the
vehicle as before.]
MICHAELS
Lower your weapon, Captain.
O'NEILL
What the hell is going on here?
MICHAELS
What is with you, Jack? Operation East Fly is go.
O'NEILL
No!
[He grabs Michaels by the jacket and holds his gun up to him]
O'NEILL
You! Who are you and who are those people?
(Referring to the people in black.)
MICHAELS
There's no one here but us! What are you looking for a Section 8,
Jack?
[A man dressed in decorative robes and headdress appears from behind
the truck.]
THE KEEPER
You must stop arguing and proceed with the mission.
[He smirks at their questioning looks.]
THE KEEPER
Allow me to introduce myself, I am the Keeper.
O'NEILL
(Puzzled)
The keeper of what?
THE KEEPER
The keeper of all that is around you, of all that is and all that
might be.
[O'Neill studies Michaels for a moment, then lets him go and lowers his
weapon.]
TEAL'C
Why do you wish us to proceed with this mission?
THE KEEPER
(To O'Neill)
Because it is that which *you* have always wanted.
O'NEILL
You've got to be kidding me. This was the most blown operation I've
ever been involved with. What makes you think I want to watch my
friends be killed over and over again?
THE KEEPER
You have always wished to do it again in order to do it differently.
MICHAELS
We're going with or without you, Jack.
O'NEILL
See ya.
MICHAELS
(Irritably)
All right. Have it your way.
THE KEEPER
You must go with them. It's the only way to evince the change that
you have desired for so many years.
O'NEILL
I can't change the outcome if you keep changing the rules.
THE KEEPER
Do you not wish to save the lives of your friends and comrades?
O'NEILL
If they were real!
THE KEEPER
But there are so many fantastic variations that you could try.
(Enticingly)
Perhaps this time you could try a different route?
[O'Neill looks at the Keeper, then looks around at the people.]
O'NEILL
(Eyes back on the Keeper)
Sit down, Teal'c. We're not playing this game.
[O'Neill brushes past the other man.]
THE KEEPER
(Rolling his eyes)
Very well. Have it your way.
[The Keeper moves away, while O'Neill and Teal'c stand by the stone
wall bordering the field. They lean leisurely, but uneasily, against
the wall.]
TEAL'C
I hope by doing nothing we are taking the correct action, O'Neill.
[O'Neill nods as guns open fire in the background.]
O'NEILL
(Grimly)
So do I.
INT--VIRTUAL EARTH--NEW YORK MUSEUM OF ART
[Daniel is composing himself as he leans against a display case in the
museum. Carter is standing by him.]
CARTER
Daniel, I'm so sorry you had to go through that again. I've been
thinking, we were pulled into those things, those machines, right?
At first, when we got here, I thought maybe they were some sort of
time dilation machines...
DANIEL
(sighing)
Oh Sam, please just...just tell me that this isn't real.
CARTER
No, I don't think it is. It isn't consistent with any of the logical
theories of time travel. For example, you should be seeing yourself
here as a child or become a child again. Daniel, I'm guessing here,
but I think we're in some sort of advanced re-creation being pumped
into our minds by those machines.
[In the background, voices are heard again.]
MELBURN
Okay, careful with that cover stone.
[Daniel stands quickly in alarm and moves to view the exhibit area.
Carter is right there with him. The Jacksons are back under the cover
stone directing the set up. They are alive and well. Carter watches
Daniel with concern, then Daniel steps forward to the exhibit area.]
MUSEUM WORKER
I'm sorry. This area isn't open to the public.
[Again, Daniel ignores her and goes up to his parents.]
CARTER
(Calling after him)
Daniel, I don't think we're actually here.
CLAIRE
Jake, it's swinging a bit.
DANIEL
(To himself)
No...
[Carter looks around and sees the people shrouded in black standing
amidst the displays observing the events.]
DANIEL
(To his parents)
Excuse me.
(Claire and Melburn look up at him from their schematics.)
Listen to me. Um, you have to come out of there.
MELBURN
Danny, go back outside.
[Claire keeps a wary eye on the cover stone, while Melburn looks back
at the schematics.]
DANIEL
(To himself, a memory is evoked)
Danny...
(To his parents)
No, look, look, you have to come out right now, because I...
(Claire looks at him frowning indulgently)
...because I...I hurt myself. I hurt myself badly. I think I might
have broken my leg. Now, you have to come out right now and take
care of me.
CLAIRE
You couldn't have hurt your leg too badly, dear. You're walking on
it, okay? We'll be out in a minute, okay, Sweetie?
MELBURN
(To Jake)
Okay, Jake.
[His parents are too consumed in the set up.]
DANIEL
(Backing away frustrated)
No...No...!
[The chain snaps and the cover stone falls again. His parents scream
and Melburn grabs Claire around the waist trying to yank her out of the
way, but the pillars and stone topple and engulf them. Daniel shuts his
eyes and Carter turns away, while the workers start scrambling in the
background to free Daniel's parents. Carter looks back and sees that
the mysterious people are still standing around watching.]
JAKE
Help me with this. Help me with this. Dr. Jackson! Dr. Jackson, can
you hear me? I can't see anything. Here, help me with this. Lift it!
Lift it! It's too heavy.
[Stunned, Daniel turns and walks mutely away from the scene,
desperately trying to keep his emotions in check. Carter rushes up to
him.]
CARTER
Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong but I'll bet when this really
happened, you didn't have this audience.
[She indicates the people in black. Daniel looks up from his grief and
sees what Carter is seeing.]
CARTER
I think that we must be in some sort of really advanced simulation,
like a...a virtual reality. It's the only thing I can think of that
could explain all this.
DANIEL
(sardonically)
Oh super. So it takes one of the most tragic moments in my life and
plays it over and over again.
CARTER
Well, maybe that's your strongest memory.
DANIEL
He called me 'Danny' like I'm...like I'm still a little kid.
CARTER
That's probably because that's how old you were when this happened.
You have taken on the role of Daniel Jackson as a child in this
simulation.
DANIEL
You know, I used to replay this over and over in my mind trying to
think if there was anything I could've done to make a difference.
CARTER
Okay, okay, so maybe that's the point. Here's your chance.
THE KEEPER
Is it not wonderful?
[They look up and see the museum worker morph into the Keeper]
THE KEEPER
Now you get the chance.
[Carter and Daniel look at the strange man as he beams at them. Daniel
approaches him warily.]
DANIEL
I beg...I beg your pardon?
CARTER
The chance?
THE KEEPER
The chance to relive your momentous event. To try the plethora of
variations that have been weighing on your mind to finally see if
you can make a difference.
[Daniel glances from him to the strange shrouded people and back to the
Keeper.]
DANIEL
Who are you?
THE KEEPER
Why, I am the Keeper, of course.
DANIEL
The keeper of...
THE KEEPER
The keeper of all that is, was and will be in this place.
CARTER
Yeah, where exactly are we?
THE KEEPER
I believe you call this the New York Museum of Art.
CARTER
No, no, where are we in reality?
THE KEEPER
Reality is in the eye of the beholder, is it not?
(To Daniel)
You have always wished to go back and do things differently. I have
given you that opportunity. Now go, make things right in this place!
DANIEL
And how do I...how do I do that?
THE KEEPER
Well, if I told you that it wouldn't be any fun, would it?
[He laughs]
DANIEL
(Angrily)
Fun?!? That's...that's what you think this is for me? Fun? Watching
this happen again and again?
[He indicates the exhibit.]
THE KEEPER
(Smirking)
There would be no pleasure from the gain if there were no risk from
the journey.
MELBURN
(In the background)
All right, careful with that cover stone.
[Daniel's attention is drawn back to the exhibit.]
JAKE
Yes, Doctor Jackson.
[Daniel once again sees his parents directing the placement of the
cover stone. Carter watches Daniel compassionately as Daniel seemingly
weighs his options. He looks back at the Keeper who smirks knowingly.
The shrouded people gather closer. Decision made, Daniel stalks back up
to his parents and looks right at his mother. Claire sees him and
smiles warmly.]
CLAIRE
Danny...what are you doing?
DANIEL
Come on.
[Daniel grabs each of his parents' wrists and pulls at them. They
resist.]
MELBURN
Dan...Danny Jackson! You stop this right now!
(To Jake)
Jake, Jake, give me a hand here, please.
[Jake puts an arm around Daniel's waist and pulls him out of the way
while his parents resume their work under the cover stone.]
DANIEL
(Desperately crying out.)
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No!
MELBURN
Bring it in.
CLAIRE
A bit more level.
DANIEL
(Still held by Jake.)
No!
MELBURN
A little more level, bring it in.
[The chain snaps, his parents scream as they are crushed again.]
DANIEL
(Crying out a sob)
No! God, no.
[Gritting his teeth, Daniel loosens himself from Jake's hold and storms
back to confront the Keeper.]
DANIEL
Damn you!
[He grabs the Keeper by the lapels.]
DANIEL
Stop this game now!
THE KEEPER
Whatever for? You haven't explored all your options yet.
DANIEL
Well, obviously my options are infinite and my solutions are zero,
now stop it!
[The Keeper merely looks at him, and Daniel sees that he has no
intention of stopping it.]
DANIEL
(To the Keeper, quietly)
I won't play any more.
THE KEEPER
Ah, but you will. You will.
MELBURN
(In the background)
All right, careful with that cover stone.
[Daniel looks over towards the exhibit again, seeing his parents. He
then turns back to the Keeper and lets the Keeper go from his grasp
then walks away from the exhibit, stone-faced.]
CARTER
Daniel, you want me to...?
DANIEL
No.
[Melburn and Claire continue their conversation in the background. The
focus is on Daniel.]
MELBURN
Let's bring it down. Just a look at the front. Bring it in.
CLAIRE
It's swinging.
MELBURN
(To Claire)
It's okay. It's fine. We'll be fine.
(To Jake)
Careful.
THE KEEPER
(To Daniel)
You must try another alternative.
DANIEL
No.
THE KEEPER
You would allow your parents to suffer this awful death?
DANIEL
I won't play your game.
[The chain snaps and his parents scream. Carter winces, but Daniel
refuses to acknowledge the scenario playing out behind them.]
THE KEEPER
(Irritably taking a deep breath)
You are indeed an obstinate race.
[Turning away from Daniel, the Keeper uses a device on his wrist. A
moment later, O'Neill and Teal'c appear in the Museum. O'Neill and
Daniel walk towards each other. O'Neill shakes a finger at the Keeper.]
O'NEILL
(Angrily)
You.
(To Carter and Daniel)
You guys all right?
DANIEL
I'm not really sure, to tell you the truth.
TEAL'C
What is this place?
DANIEL
Well, it's the New York Museum of Art.
CARTER
Actually, we think it's a simulation of the museum. I figure we're
in some sort of virtual reality world created from our own minds, or
at least Daniel's.
THE KEEPER
You are a very stubborn, unimaginative and non-competitive race. Why
do you refuse to enjoy the opportunities that I have given you?
O'NEILL
(Incredulous)
Enjoy?! What makes you think I enjoy watching my friends get killed?
DANIEL
Or their parents die?
THE KEEPER
You have both been given challenges to be met and conquered. You
have it in you. Why will you not partake?
O'NEILL
Why will you not just let us go?
THE KEEPER
(Excitedly)
Go where? Where would you like to go? I can take you anywhere you
can remember, anywhere you can imagine.
O'NEILL
Okay, we want to go free.
CARTER
So, we're right. This is a simulated world.
THE KEEPER
It is a world completely inside your minds; channeled, coordinated,
and administered by myself, the Keeper.
CARTER
But how? How does it work?
O'NEILL
I don't care how it works. I just want outta here.
THE KEEPER
I cannot do that. The devices that enwrap you serve to nourish and
stimulate your senses. The devices implanted in your brains channel
experience and imagination into and out of your mind.
CARTER
So, we're trapped with our...our brains hooked up like computers to
some sort of network?
THE KEEPER
Yes, and your minds are very valuable to my residents because you
enrich and add value to our own.
DANIEL
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute. How long have your residents
been in this virtual world?
THE KEEPER
Roughly one thousand of your years.
O'NEILL
Well, we're certainly not going to stick around for the next
thousand of anyone's years.
DANIEL
So, until we came along you've only had your own minds, your own
experiences to provide scenarios for your virtual lives?
THE KEEPER
You're beginning to understand.
DANIEL
So, so, wh...what, we're like...we're like new software?
[The Keeper nods as O'Neill looks at Daniel to explain.]
DANIEL
(To O'Neill)
I mean, imagine if you were locked in a room for a thousand years
with only a VCR, a TV and five movies. How long could you watch
those five movies until you were bored silly? What you wouldn't give
for just four more.
CARTER
So you're using our minds, our memories, imaginations, dreams
for...for some sort of programming?
THE KEEPER
Actually, I can remove information from only two of your minds.
(Regarding Teal'c)
This species' mind seems to protect against output, as does yours,
madam.
(Regarding Carter.)
CARTER
It does?
TEAL'C
Perhaps because of the change in your mind the Goa'uld, Jolinar of
Malk-shur, left behind.
THE KEEPER
But fear not, there is no block against *input* into your minds. You
two can enjoy our adventures and these two minds,
(referring to O'Neill and Daniel)
they provide more than enough rich experience and imagination to
provide years of entertainment for my residents.
O'NEILL
Well, I'm sorry.
[He turns to the people shrouded in black]
O'NEILL
With all due respect to you fine folks, I don't give a damn about
residents. I just wanna get us out of here.
THE KEEPER
It is I that am sorry, for I am not able to accommodate your
request. But I am sure you will be able to enjoy the many adventures
that you will have here.
DANIEL
Why are your people in here anyway? I mean, wh...why don't you just
go out and get some new experiences of your own, *live* some new
experiences?
THE KEEPER
We cannot leave our chambers. The world outside is uninhabitable. It
has been poisoned and desecrated.
TEAL'C
You are mistaken. Your planet is a fertile garden world.
THE KEEPER
(Nervously)
It is you who are mistaken, my alien friend. Our planet was
destroyed by a chemical disaster one thousand and twenty-two years
ago. We were victims of our own technology advancing faster than we
could control it. At that time, the few of us who were left placed
our physical bodies in suspended animation.
CARTER
Good news. Your planet seems to have regenerated itself.
THE KEEPER
(To the residents, appalled.)
This is not true! I monitor all conditions at all times!
CARTER
Well, then your monitoring systems are wrong. It is beautiful out
there.
O'NEILL
(To the Keeper)
Of course you already knew that, didn't you?
[The Keeper swings around to glare at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
The question is, why don't you want them to know?
[He indicates the residents.]
THE KEEPER
Residents must not leave the environment.
(Loudly, to the residents mostly)
The outside world is uninhabitable!
O'NEILL
Who made you the warden here, huh?
THE KEEPER
I do not understand.
DANIEL
Why are you the one running things here?
THE KEEPER
(Agitated)
The environment is my design. I am its creator, its Keeper.
O'NEILL
So if your residents leave, you lose control.
(Turning to the residents)
That man is lying to you folks.
(The Keeper activates his wrist device again)
He's got you imprisoned in your own...
[The residents are transported elsewhere, leaving the Keeper and SG-1
alone in the virtual museum.]
O'NEILL
(Turns to glare at the Keeper)
Well, that's good. That's fair. Send them to where they can't hear
the truth.
THE KEEPER
Look, I will not allow you to poison their minds.
DANIEL
Um...
(Daniel walks over to join O'Neill)
...if you keep us here, you won't be able to prevent us from
interacting with them for very long. I mean, especially if we're
supposed to be...new software for them.
THE KEEPER
Very well, you weren't wanted here anymore anyway.
[The Keeper activates his wrist device again.]
INT--DOMED STRUCTURE--STASIS CHAMBER AREA
[SG-1 awaken in their stasis chambers. The tubes are gone. They look
around cautiously.]
DANIEL
We're out.
O'NEILL
Whoa!
[He jumps out of his chamber.]
CARTER
Wait. Didn't that seem just a little too easy?
O'NEILL
Yes it did. Let's go home.
[They step out of their stasis chambers.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[SG-1 are each seated on exam tables being looked over by medical
personnel. Hammond looks on as Fraiser is assessing O'Neill.]
FRAISER
(Shining a penlight in his eyes.)
They all have small puncture wounds in their temples, spinal cords
and several abdominal areas.
O'NEILL
Meaning what?
FRAISER
Well, looks like the machines you were describing were sustaining
your lives; providing you with oxygen, feeding you, removing the
waste and, from the sound of it, completely controlling your nervous
system.
HAMMOND
But is there any permanent damage?
FRAISER
No, not that I can see. Pupil dilation is bang on, reflexes are as
they should be, everything seems fine to me.
[Hammond looks on grimly, as does O'Neill.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[SG-1, Hammond and Fraiser are seated at the conference table, except
Daniel who is walking back with a cup of coffee in his hand.]
DANIEL
Jack, we should go back to the planet and free those people.
O'NEILL
I'm not sure it's any of our business, frankly.
[Daniel takes his seat next to O'Neill.]
HAMMOND
I concur. Who are we to judge how someone on another planet lives?
DANIEL
But the people are in those machines under false pretenses. The
Keeper is lying to them about what's outside.
FRAISER
Okay, if, if I may weigh in here...all evidence points to the fact
that the machines are clinically sustaining those people. Removing
them could be like taking a patient off life support when he still
needs it.
HAMMOND
Sounds to me like we have to get more information to make this
decision, folks.
TEAL'C
The only way to gain more information would be to venture back into
the artificial world of P7J-989.
HAMMOND
Then that's exactly what I want you to do.
[Narrowing his eyes at the General, O'Neill sits forward in his seat.]
O'NEILL
Uhhhh...General. Without meaning, this time, to sound like a
smart-ass, are you cracked?
HAMMOND
(Chuckles)
Folks, I don't need to tell you how valuable a resource this planet
could be for us. Their technology is far beyond our own--the kind of
technology that justifies this entire program.
CARTER
General Hammond, going back into that world could be very hazardous.
HAMMOND
I fail to see how. It's an artificial environment. Can you actually
die in there?
CARTER
We don't know.
O'NEILL
I'm a little more concerned about being trapped there, Sir.
HAMMOND
You got out the last time.
TEAL'C
There is no guarantee we will be able to extract ourselves again.
HAMMOND
Okay, I'll tell you what: if you don't come out in one week, I'll
send in SG-2 to pull you out.
[Daniel gives O'Neill a sideways glance.]
HAMMOND
Besides, what's so bad about being in there? It sounds to me like
you can experience all sorts of fascinating things.
O'NEILL
You mean, like watching old friends and...
DANIEL
Parents.
O'NEILL
(nodding at Daniel)
...family getting killed over and over again?
HAMMOND
(Optimistically)
Or seeing Major Kawalsky alive and well? Who knows, Colonel, maybe
you could even see your son.
[O'Neill looks at him, then at Daniel.]
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson, perhaps you could visit the ancient worlds you've
always wondered about.
[Daniel just gapes at him, disbelievingly.]
HAMMOND
You can go anywhere your memories or imaginations want to go.
[SG-1 exchange glances. O'Neill looks back at the General, an irritated
knowing smirk playing out on his face.]
O'NEILL
Okay. That's enough.
[He rises from his chair and goes over to the General and bends over
him. He gently pulls the General's ear forward to peer behind it.]
O'NEILL
Let's just have a little look here, shall we?
HAMMOND
What are you doing, Colonel?
O'NEILL
Oh, I'm looking for the edges of a mask!
HAMMOND
What?
O'NEILL
You're obviously not the real General Hammond.
HAMMOND
Sit down, Colonel!
O'NEILL
I don't think so, bucko. The jig's up. We're on to ya.
HAMMOND
What are you talking about?
CARTER
(To O'Neill, knowingly)
We're still on P7J-989.
O'NEILL
Oh, you betcha. This is just a new game brought to you by our good
friend...
(Pats Hammond on the head)
...the Keeper.
HAMMOND
(Stands up)
You are way out of line, Colonel!
FRAISER
(Stands up)
You could be having a nervous reaction to the machines, we should
get back to the infirmary and run some tests.
O'NEILL
No, you should get us out of these damn machines is what you should
do!
[An SF approaches O'Neill from behind, locking and loading his weapon.
Teal'c stands up in alarm.]
O'NEILL
(Turns to the SF and challenges)
Oh, what!
HAMMOND
Colonel, your insubordination is testing my patience. I will give
you one final chance to follow my orders and rejoin the residents of
the artificial world.
CARTER
'Residents.'
(Nodding, now sure of where they are)
That's what the Keeper called them.
[Carter and Daniel stand up.]
HAMMOND
Are you going back in or not, Colonel?
O'NEILL
I'm already in!
[Other SFs walk into the Briefing Room.]
HAMMOND
(To SFs)
Place SG-1 under arrest and put them in isolation where they can
speak to no one!
[SG-1 are handcuffed and are escorted out of the Briefing Room as
Hammond and Fraiser look on.]
INT--VIRTUAL SGC BRIG--ISOLATION CELL
[Two SFs guard the door from the inside. Teal'c and Carter are seated
at a table. O'Neill is leaning against a bunk, where Daniel is lying on
his stomach perched on the top bunk. His arms are folded and he is
resting his chin on them.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill, you seem quite confident that we are not on Earth.
O'NEILL
(Steps away from the bunk)
Because we're not. Did that sound like the real General Hammond to
anyone?
[He swings around, his arms outstretched.]
TEAL'C
It is my understanding that we can only experience past events in
this environment.
CARTER
Actually, the Keeper said we could experience anything that we
remember or that we could imagine.
O'NEILL
We're still on PJ7-nine eight niner. It's a fake environment.
KAWALSKY
(A few short steps, gazing at his feet.)
Is that really so bad?
[Daniel lifts his head, surprised to see Kawalsky, who only moments
before was one of the SF guards. O'Neill turns to view his dead friend
and teammate.]
KAWALSKY
I mean come on, haven't you people missed me at all?
(O'Neill regards him uncomfortably.)
Why are you resisting this? Think of all the fun we could have
together. Doctor Jackson, you gotta admit, I used to make you laugh.
Colonel, who else are you going to get to play street hockey with
who can kick your butt the way I can? Captain Carter, think what it
would be like to never grow old. Cuz you never do here, ya know.
O'NEILL
Who are you?
KAWALSKY
Who am I? Colonel, are telling me you don't remember me? I'm hurt,
I'm really hurt.
O'NEILL
No, no, I know who you're pretending to be. But who are you really?
Are you the Keeper?
KAWALSKY
Nah, not me.
O'NEILL
Then what? Some kind of projection or...because you're not real. And
if you're not real...you won't mind this.
[O'Neill punches Kawalsky in the jaw, while Teal'c hits the other
guard. Once they are both down, SG-1 leave the cell. They take a few
steps and as they turn the corner, the residents are waiting for them.
SG-1 stop short.]
O'NEILL
(Cautiously)
Hello.
[Two of the residents remove their black veils.]
RESIDENT #1
We have been looking for you.
RESIDENT #2
Please, tell us what you began to tell us before.
RESIDENT #1
About what it is like outside.
TEAL'C
It is in fact quite agreeable outside.
RESIDENT #2
The poison is gone?
RESIDENT #1
Everything is not dead?
DANIEL
Well, no. Quite the opposite. Everything is blooming.
RESIDENT #1
How can that be? The Keeper tells us it is dangerous.
O'NEILL
Well, the...the Keeper lies.
RESIDENT #1
How can we trust these creatures above the Keeper who has cared for
us for so long?
O'NEILL
Tell ya what -- come with us. We'll show you.
[The residents exchange nervous glances. Resident #1 nods at O'Neill.
He nods in return, then moves through the throng of residents.]
O'NEILL
Excuse me.
[SG-1 lead the residents through the corridor. Daniel catches up to
O'Neill.]
DANIEL
Where are we going?
O'NEILL
Back through the Gate to show them what their planet looks like...
(Daniel looks at him curiously, and O'Neill does a double-take.)
...in our memories...
(Daniel still eyes him, smirking)
before the virtual reality...
(giving up)
Leave me alone.
INT--VIRTUAL SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate kawooshes to life as the klaxons sound. SG-1 and the
residents enter the Gate room.]
HAMMOND
Unauthorized Stargate activation. Shutting down the Gate.
[Hammond's voice rings out over the intercom. The team see Hammond in
the Control room manipulating the console controls. The Stargate
disengages.]
HAMMOND
SG-1, you are trying my patience!
[O'Neill races out of the Gate room, followed by his team.]
INT--VIRTUAL SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond stops playing with the computer console and runs off when he
sees O'Neill climbing up the stairs to the control room. O'Neill runs
after him with Daniel following.]
O'NEILL
Daniel, with me!
INT--VIRTUAL SGC CORRIDOR
[Hammond rounds a corner and morphs into the Keeper. Daniel and O'Neill
continue after him. The Keeper goes through another door just as Teal'c
and Carter exit into the hallway and rejoin O'Neill and Daniel. They go
through the door after the Keeper. The door has P7J-989's point of
origin on it. SG-1 slow down to a walking pace when they see at the end
of the corridor is the gardened stasis chamber area under the domed
structure. As they approach, they see the stasis chamber is the one
holding O'Neill within its tentacles. O'Neill gazes at himself.]
[The tubes detach from O'Neill's temples and he wakes. The rest of the
team are also awake and are free of the chamber. Daniel looks around
uncertainly.]
DANIEL
Do you think we're really out this time?
[O'Neill spots the Keeper running toward a door.]
O'NEILL
Hey!
[The Keeper escapes through the door and SG-1 give chase.]
EXT--P7J-989--OUTSIDE THE DOMED STRUCTURE
[The team have chased the Keeper outside. Teal'c gets to him first and
grasps his shoulders, forcing him to stop.]
THE KEEPER
(Fearful)
Please! Do not hurt me. I meant you no harm. Understand my people's
existence has become stagnant. I wanted only good for them.
CARTER
How long have you been coming out to tend this garden?
THE KEEPER
(smirking briefly)
Lovely, is it not?
O'NEILL
(Irritated)
How. Long?
THE KEEPER
Oh, many, many years.
DANIEL
Then why do you lie to your people? Why don't...why don't you give
them the option to come out with you?
THE KEEPER
Because it was our kind that damaged the planet in the first place.
If I let them out, they will only hurt it again.
CARTER
You're kidding.
TEAL'C
Perhaps your people will not make the same mistakes again.
O'NEILL
(Snidely)
Yeah, you're big on giving people a second chance, aren't ya?
THE KEEPER
(Indignant)
No one is preventing them from leaving. Portals such as the one
you've used are everywhere within.
DANIEL
So, you mean we could've left anytime we wanted? All we had to do
was go through one of those doors?
THE KEEPER
Anyone may leave at any time. Portals are always open.
O'NEILL
Of course, people have to know they exist to use them.
THE KEEPER
(Contemptuously)
Which you have now shown them.
CARTER
And they have to know that there's somewhere to go.
THE KEEPER
And you have told them *that*. You have ruined everything, poisoned
their minds. The damage is done.
[SG-1 turn to see the residents filtering out of the domed structure.
The Keeper looks annoyed, and O'Neill shrugs.]
EXT--PLANET P7J- 989 STARGATE
[A resident watches Daniel dial Earth. The Stargate opens. O'Neill
joins Daniel at the DHD.]
RESIDENT #1
(To O'Neill)
Again, we thank you. You have given us a whole new world of beauty
and future experiences.
O'NEILL
Well you've still got a lot of work to do, but we'll send along some
supplies to get you started.
THE KEEPER
(Stalking between the group.)
They are ruining everything.
(He glares at O'Neill.)
Do you know they are actually picking the flowers?
[He stalks off.]
O'NEILL
(To Daniel)
This is real this time, isn't it?
[The Keeper utters noises of outrage, gasping at what the residents are
doing in the garden.]
THE KEEPER
(To residents)
Do not pull that!!
[Residents are picking flowers.]
THE KEEPER
You are ruining the garden!
[He turns and glowers at Daniel and O'Neill.]
THE KEEPER
I told you they will ruin everything. First, the garden. Next, the
entire planet!
[O'Neill and Daniel look at each other and smile.]
O'NEILL/DANIEL
(In unison)
It's real.
[SG-1 turn and walk away. Daniel spares a glance back at the Keeper.]
THE KEEPER
(To residents.)
You are ruining the garden!
O'NEILL
(Cheerfully)
'S go!
(Carter hands him his weapon.)
Thank you, ma'am.
[The team head for the Stargate as the Keeper bites his fist,
completely outraged.]
FADE OUT
