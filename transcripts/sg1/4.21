TITLE
Double Jeopardy
TEASER
EXT--PLANET JUNA
[There is a pyramid in the background. In front of the Stargate is a
line of large stones. The Stargate activates. O'Neill, Carter, Daniel
and Teal'c step through. They spread out silently, armed and expecting
an ambush.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill! Footprints and they are recent.
O'NEILL
How many?
TEAL'C
Several. Some are that of Jaffa.
[O'Neill is attacked from behind with a zat.]
CARTER
Take cover!
[Teal'c, O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are surrounded by armed Juna
people.]
JAFFA
Drop your weapons and surrender!
DANIEL
They don't look like Jaffa.
[A Jaffa approaches from behind the Stargate. Darien is behind him.]
CARTER
He does.
JAFFA
There is no escape. Stand and identify yourselves.
DARIEN
They need not. I know who they are.
DANIEL
I'm sorry, have we…have we met?
DARIEN
They are warriors from a planet called Earth. They are known as
SG-1. How dare you return here?
OPENING TITLES
EXT--PLANET JUNA
[The Jaffa is collecting the weapons from O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c.]
DANIEL
Look I think there's been a misunderstanding.
DARIEN
They are the ones who led us in the rebellion against the servants
of Heru'ur. You told us to bury our Stargate. You said that the Gods
would not return, but that was not true. Cronus came in his great
ship. He claimed our planet, commanded that we serve him.
CARTER
I'm sorry about what's happened but you don't understand.
DARIEN
Why do you insult me, Major Carter. Would you have me believe you
have not been here? I know who you are. You are Daniel Jackson.
Teal'c. And that is Colonel O'Neill.
[They look around. O'Neill is missing.]
JAFFA
Where is he? Find him! Bring them.
[The Juna run into the forest.]
INT--INSIDE A GOA'ULD PYRAMID. THE THRONE ROOM.
[The Jaffa enters with Darien leading Daniel, Teal'c and Carter. The
Jaffa Sindar is seated in a throne.]
DARIEN
Hail Sindar. Loyal servant of Cronus.
SINDAR
Who is this?
JAFFA
They came through the Chappa'ai.
DARIEN
They are the ones who came before and fought against the servants of
Heru'ur.
SINDAR
You are the shol'va Teal'c. My master will be most pleased.
JAFFA
There is another who was with them. He escaped into the forest.
DARIEN
He is their leader.
SINDAR
Find him.
DARIEN
We will not fail you.
[Darien leaves.]
EXT--OUTSIDE THE PYARMID, NIGHT. THE VILLAGE
INT--A HOME IN THE VILLAGE
[Darien enters a simple home lit with candles. Hira is seated at the
table.]
DARIEN
Goodnight, Hira.
HIRA
Goodnight, husband.
DARIEN
Cronus comes tomorrow. I pray that he will reward us kindly for
having captured the warriors from planet Earth. I fear Cronus will
be disappointed that our search parties have been unable to capture
their leader. Is something wrong? You behave strangely.
[O'Neill steps out of the shadows behind Darien. He is armed.]
INT--GOA'ULD PRISON CELL
[Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are standing together alone in the cell.]
CARTER
That Darien guy called me Major.
DANIEL
Well, this was a major screw up.
CARTER
Well, how could we know?
TEAL'C
There is always the risk that planets we explore may be occupied by
Goa'uld forces.
DANIEL
Yes, but one we've actually been to before?
CARTER
Do you think it's a bad sign Colonel O'Neill hasn't tried to
communicate yet?
TEAL'C
I do not. I do not believe we should attempt to communicate with him
either. The Goa'uld may have means of tracking our signal.
CARTER
Mission time's approaching 8 hours. What are we going to do?
DANIEL
Well, we can't tell them the truth.
INT--DARIEN'S HOME
[Darien, Hira and O'Neill are seated at the dining table]
DARIEN
I do not understand.
O'NEILL
I know how you feel.
DARIEN
There are two of you?
O'NEILL
Ahh, it's more complicated than that.
DARIEN
Please, do not harm my wife.
O'NEILL
I'm not going to hurt either one of you. I just want someone to
explain to me what happened here before I arrived.
DARIEN
Do you mean the first time you were here?
O'NEILL
Mmm mm
DARIEN
You came through the Chappa'ai. You said that our God, Heru'ur, was
a false God. You organised a rebellion. With your help we banished
Heru'ur's Jaffa. You said we were free and the false Gods would not
bother us again. We did live in peace for a time but eventually
Cronus came in his ship and declared that our planet now fell under
his domain. He commanded that we worship him.
O'NEILL
All right, look. Neither one of those guys is a God, okay?
DARIEN
I will not believe you this time. The punishment my people suffered
for our prior indiscretion was my fault. I asked them to follow you
and they were forced to pay dearly for it.
O'NEILL
It was not an indiscretion. It was the right thing to do no matter
how it turned out.
DARIEN
Do what you will. Tomorrow Cronus comes and you and the rest of your
kind will face the consequences.
O'NEILL
Yeah, whatever.
DARIEN
There will be no escape.
O'NEILL
Close your eyes. Close your eyes please.
[Darien and Hira close their eyes. O'Neill looks behind him.]
DARIEN
How long are we to remain like this?
[Darien opens his eyes. O'Neill has vanished.]
EXT--TIP OF THE PYRAMID.
[A light beam comes from the sky-a ring transporter beam.]
INT--PYRAMID. THE THONE ROOM.
[The ring transporter diposits Cronus and two Jaffa inside. Sindar and
two more Jaffa are awaiting him, kneeling before him.]
SINDAR
My Lord. Your presence honours me.
CRONUS
Tell me of the intruders from Earth.
SINDAR
There were three. And the Jaffa, Teal'c. Shol'va. The one called
O'Neill has thus far eluded capture.
EXT--JUNA FOREST.
[Juna warriors are searching the undergrowth. Darien approaches.]
DARIEN
Warriors of Juna. We are called before Cronus.
[The Juna follow Darien. One man lags behind. As he follows, he sees a
dead hand poking out from a pile of leaves and covers it.]
EXT--TIP OF THE PYRAMID.
INT--PYAMID THRONE ROOM
[Cronus is pacing behind the assembled Juna warriors.]
CRONUS
Warriors of Juna. For your loyalty you shall be rewarded.
[We see that O'Neill is among the Juna, disguised as a Juna warrior.]
CRONUS
Bring in the prisoners.
[Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are led in by Jaffa and forced to their
knees in front of Cronus.]
CRONUS
The treaty between the System Lords and the Asgard does not protect
you here. I once told you that if you were ever at my mercy I would
not be kind. You will not be fortunate to die as quickly as your
father did by my hand, Shol'va! Your fate will be much worse. You
will all pay for your sins.
[Cronus looks at Darien]
CRONUS
Come forward. You lead your people in my name?
DARIEN
I do my Lord.
[Sindar offers Darien a staff weapon.]
CRONUS
Take it.
[Darien takes the staff weapon. Cronus nods towards Daniel. Daniel is
brought forward by the Jaffa and forced again to his knees. Daniel sees
O'Neill amongst the Juna]
CRONUS
In honour of your God, kill him.
[There is a general look of horror on the faces of Daniel, Carter and
Darien.]
CRONUS
Hashak Kree!
[Jaffa walk out behind the Juna warriors and aim staff weapons at their
backs]
CRONUS
Kill him!
[Darien steps forward and aims the staff weapon at Daniel. Daniel looks
at O'Neill in the crowd and shakes his head once. O'Neill nods and
looks down. Darien primes the staff weapon. Daniel closes his eyes.
Carter closes her eyes. Darien fires. The blast takes Daniel's head
from his body. The head rolls across the floor. The body collapses. We
see that inside the head are electronics. This Daniel is the clone
Daniel! Everyone looks shocked, except O'Neill.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond is hurrying down the stairs from the briefing room followed by
Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill.]
TECH
Receiving IDC. Sir we're receiving the signal on the IDC frequency
but this is not an authorised SGC code.
CARTER
It says 'Comtraya'.
HAMMOND
What does it mean?
O'NEILL
Ahh, it's kinda like shalome or aloha, that stuff.
TEAL'C
It was the greeting used by the artificial life form Harlan on
PX3989.
HAMMOND
The one who duplicated you?
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir please don't open the Gate, please.
CARTER
I admit he was annoying but he wasn't a serious threat.
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
INT--GATE ROOM
[The iris opens. Harlan steps through the event horizon.]
HARLAN
Ohh, ohh, I have no weapons.
[Hammond, Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill enter the Gate room.]
HAMMOND
Stand down.
HARLAN
Oh thank you for opening the doorway device that you call iris.
O'NEILL
Just for the record, I was opposed.
HAMMOND
Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond, leader of this facility.
HARLAN
Comtraya. Yes, I have heard so much about you.
CARTER
What's wrong Harlan?
HARLAN
Oh please yes, it is a very big emergency. You must help…you.
EXT--GOA'ULD PYRAMID AND VILLAGE
INT--PYRAMID THRONE ROOM
[Cronus is standing before Clone Carter and Clone Teal'c.]
CRONUS
What are you? Speak! Speak or I shall have you torn apart!
(Issuing an order to his Jaffa)
Bring them to the ship. Find the other one!
JAFFA
Yes, my Lord.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, Teal'c and Carter are seated around the table. O'Neill and
Harlan are standing.]
HARLAN
I told them not to go. I begged them. Going through the Stargate is
dangerous, very, very dangerous. You told me all about the Goa'uld,
you did. You must help, yes, no?
O'NEILL
Harlan!
HARLAN
Yes?
O'NEILL
Sit!
HARLAN
Yes.
O'NEILL
Now, from the beginning.
HARLAN
The beginning, yes. They were not happy, they could not stop being
you. The portable power pack you invented…
CARTER
The robot me?
HARLAN
Oh it was ingenious. Even Hubbald would have been impressed. I have
one in my chest now, would you like to see it?
CARTER
Yes.
O'NEILL
No! You can show her later.
HARLAN
Later yes. Help first.
TEAL'C
What type of help do you require?
HARLAN
Oh not me. You. I mean the others.
AMMOND
What exactly has happened?
HARLAN
Well they have not returned.
CARTER
Where are they?
HARLAN
Away, they go away.
CARTER
Are you saying our robots are going through the Stargate on
missions?
HARLAN
Missions, yes.
O'NEILL
What for?
HARLAN
I do not really know. What is it that you do?
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, it was my understanding that the robots agreed to
bury their Stargate and never leave their planet.
O'NEILL
Yes Sir.
HAMMOND
Then it would seem your robot counterpart is equally as good at
following orders as you.
HARLAN
They have always returned after 24 hours. For safety. The power
packs only last for 48 hours then they must be recharged.
CARTER
How overdue are they?
HARLAN
16 hours. They do not have much time left. Ohhhh.
EXT--THE JUNA VILLAGE.
INT--DARIEN'S HOME.
[Darien enters, sombre and disturbed.]
HIRA
What is it? What has happened?
[They move over to sit by the table.]
DARIEN
It was unlike anything I have ever seen. Cronus brought the
prisoners before us. I was given a weapon of the guards. To
demonstrate my loyalty, Cronus instructed me to kill the one called
Daniel Jackson.
HIRA
And so?
DARIEN
I fired the weapon. What happened next was unholy. I have seen men
decapitated in battle. What I saw was not human. That was not the
most disturbing thing.
HIRA
What was?
DARIEN
Cronus was as shocked by the fact that Daniel Jackson was not human
as the rest of us. He sent us away immediately.
HIRA
But how could a true God be surprised by anything?
DARIEN
That is what I ask myself.
INT--SGC, BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill, Carter, Harlan and Teal'c are still seated around
the table.]
O'NEILL
General, I really don't think we're responsible for retrieving these
robots.
HARLAN
But you must. They are you.
O'NEILL
Not me, they're not.
HARLAN
Where is Doctor Jackson? He will help.
CARTER
He's on a mission at the moment.
HARLAN
Ohhh, you do that so much.
HAMMOND
The fact is I don't want to risk any of my people for the sake of
some androids you created without authorisation. However…
HARLAN
However, yes?
HAMMOND
I am concerned that information about this facility could
potentially fall into the wrong hands.
HARLAN
Ah an excellent point.
CARTER
Sirs if I may, our robots are really so much like us they probably
couldn't resist the chance to use the Gate to explore. I think then
we can also assume that they would guard any top-secret information
as closely as we would. Besides they don't have our IDC codes so
they can't give those away.
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill, if you don't want to take this on, I'm not going to
make it an order.
O'NEILL
Thank you Sir.
HARLAN
But I have grown accustomed. I cannot go on without them.
CARTER
Sorry.
HARLAN
Then I shall just have to help myself.
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Harlan is picking glyphs on the Gate control computer screen. Carter,
O'Neill, Hammond and Teal'c are there.]
HARLAN
This one. This one. That one. This one. That one and this one.
CARTER
Hmm.
O'NEILL
Hmm what?
CARTER
That's what I thought. P2X 729. We've been to this planet before.
TEAL'C
We did engage in battle with the Jaffa of Heru'ur. And liberated the
people of Juna.
CARTER
That's right. We told them to bury the Gate after we were gone. Are
you sure you've got the right address?
HARLAN
I could do a full diagnostic of my systems but it might be quicker
to just dial the address.
HAMMOND
Proceed.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--JUNA, THE STARGATE
[There are Jaffa guarding the Gate. Hidden in the undergrowth, Clone
O'Neill is wiping the paint off his face. The Gate starts to dial.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
[Harlan, Hammond, Teal'c, Carter and O'Neill are watching the Gate dial
out.]
TECH
Chevron 6 encoded. Chevron 7 locked.
[The wormhole appears.]
CARTER
The Gate isn't buried.
TEAL'C
It is possible the Goa'uld travelled to the planet by ship in order
to reinstate command.
CARTER
Heru'ur is dead, the Naquadah mine was dry, those people didn't pose
any threat.
TEAL'C
Another Goa'uld may have claimed the planet for different reasons.
O'NEILL
Why?
TEAL'C
Possibly strategic military position.
CARTER
We told them they'd be okay.
HAMMOND
Send a probe. Let's find out.
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--JUNA, THE STARGATE
[The Jaffa guarding the Gate come under attack from an unseen
assailant.]
INT--SGC, CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Receiving MALP telemetry.
[On a computer screen, the camera pans. We see a Jaffa killed by zat
fire. Clone O'Neill comes into view.]
O'NEILL
Woah. I'll never get used to that.
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond of the SGC.
CLONE O'NEILL
Hey George, how you doing? Who else you got there with you?
HAMMOND
Major Carter, Teal'c, Colonel O'Neill and Harlan.
CLONE O'NEILL
Harlan! I told you to stay away from Earth.
O'NEILL
Yeah well I told you to bury your Gate.
CLONE O'NEILL
Well you seem to think that solves a lot of problems dontcha?
HAMMOND
SG-1 was following my orders.
HARLAN
I'm sorry. I did not know what else to do. Please return to our
planet.
CLONE O'NEILL
I can't do that just yet.
EXT--JUNA
[Clone O'Neill crouches and activates the zat. Darien comes out of the
undergrowth.]
DARIEN
Do not shoot. I wish to help you.
CLONE O'NEILL
Why?
INT--SGC
[We see Clone O'Neill and Darien on the computer screen.]
DARIEN
I now believe you spoke the truth about everything. Including the
Gods.
ON JUNA
CLONE O'NEILL
Why should I believe you?
DARIEN
You must trust me as I must trust you. I am sorry about the one
called Daniel.
INT--SGC
[Harlan, Hammond, Teal'c and O'Neill look surprised. On the computer
screen we see Clone O'Neill.]
CLONE O'NEILL
Get over here.
DARIEN
To whom are you speaking?
CARTER
That's Darien.
CLONE O'NEILL
Earth. George Hammond and the other SG-1.
O'NEILL
Hey! You're the other, pal.
CLONE O'NEILL
Do we really have time for semantics here?
HAMMOND
What exactly is the current situation?
CLONE O'NEILL
Our Daniel is dead.
HARLAN
Oh my.
CLONE O'NEILL
Carter and Teal'c have been captured by Cronus. He's got a ship in
orbit and his Jaffa are everywhere. So it's just Darien and me.
DARIEN
Please, help us.
HAMMOND
You have a go. SG-1 is on its way.
CLONE O'NEILL
Thanks, George. Harlan, you stay there.
EXT--SPACE. CRONUS'S SHIP IN ORBIT OF JUNA
INT--CRONUS' SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[Ja'din is standing staring out into space. Cronus is seated on his
throne.]
JA'DIN
They appear to be a fascinating technology.
CRONUS
Find out how they work. I wish to know all the information they
contain.
JA'DIN
My pleasure.
EXT--JUNA, THE STARGATE
[O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c step through the Gate. They are met by
Darian.]
DARIEN
This way.
[They follow Darien]
DARIEN
They look very much like you.
CARTER
We know.
O'NEILL
Listen, for what it's worth, I'm sorry about what's happened here.
[Clone O'Neill steps out from the undergrowth.]
CLONE O'NEILL
Oh I'm sure that makes him feel better.
O'NEILL
Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing?
CLONE O'NEILL
Same thing you do. Only better.
O'NEILL
What does that mean?
CLONE O'NEILL
Better? It means bet-ter, stronger, faster.
O'NEILL
You're not me and you don't work for the Air Force.
CLONE O'NEILL
No. But that doesn't mean I can't do the job.
O'NEILL
What job?
CLONE O'NEILL
Explore the universe. Fight the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Oh what, like now?
CLONE O'NEILL
Hey! You made this mess.
O'NEILL
What we did was help these people.
CLONE O'NEILL
Oh come on, I know you better than that. You screwed up and now
you're embarrassed.
O'NEILL
That's not the point.
CLONE O'NEILL
And like I'm going to spend my eternity on that lame ass planet?
Sheesh.
O'NEILL
You gave me your word.
CLONE O'NEILL
Oh is this the first time you've lied to yourself? I told you what
you wanted to hear. Besides, what were you going to do? Destroy me?
O'NEILL
I might have.
CLONE O'NEILL
All right come on, bring it on flyboy. Let's go. Come on.
O'NEILL
Oh, you little!
[O'Neill and Clone O'Neill start to fight.]
CARTER
Sirs. As much as I'd like to see how this plays out, don't we have
something more important to do?
[The O'NeillS stop fighting.]
DARIEN
What can so few of us possibly do?
CLONE O'NEILL
Couldn't get Hammond to spring for more troops?
O'NEILL
I didn't ask. This is our problem.
CARTER
I guess we can't expect any help from the rest of the Juna people?
DARIEN
No.
TEAL'C
We convinced your people to oppose the Goa'uld once before.
DARIEN
Most, including myself, had never seen an actual God before. Heru'ur
had not come to Juna for many generations. And when Cronos arrived
and displayed his great power he instilled much fear. The people are
terrified.
TEAL'C
Then we must demonstrate to your people once and for all that Cronus
is not a God.
CLONE O'NEILL
I assume you have a plan to back up that rather bold yet cryptic
statement?
O'NEILL
Yes. Yes, we do.
[Sound of a Jaffa horn.]
DARIEN
It is not safe to stay here. The forests are heavily patrolled.
CLONE O'NEILL
We're not done, pal!
O'NEILL
I so own you!
[They all leave the clearing]
INT--CRONUS'S SHIP. A LARGE HIGH-TECH HALL
[Clone Teal'c and Clone Carter are each standing in conical cages made
of green laser beams coming from above them. Ja'din approaches.]
JA'DIN
There is a device embedded in the chest that sensors indicate may be
a power unit. Current status: Deactivated. Can it be reactivated?
[Ja'din is speaking to the clones but they are silent. She approaches
Clone Teal'c.]
JA'DIN
Do you feel pain?
[Ja'din touches Clone Teal'c through the cage]
JA'DIN
Affirmative.
(crosses to Clone Carter)
Do you sympathise with him?
[Ja'din causes Clone Carter the same pain]
CLONE TEAL'C
No!
JA'DIN
Both units appear to show concern for each other.
[Ja'din crosses to a table where the headless Clone Daniel is lying.]
JA'DIN
Tell me how to reactivate this one's power unit. Then tell me which
one of you would like to feel sympathy and which one pain?
INT--DARIEN'S HOME
[Clone O'Neill is seated at the table. Teal'c, Carter, Darien and
O'Neill are seated around the wall]
CLONE O'NEILL
The only rings I've seen were in that pyramid.
TEAL'C
There is a way into the main chamber.
CLONE O'NEILL
Yeah, by putting the robot at risk.
O'NEILL
Fine, I'll do it.
CLONE O'NEILL
It's all right, I can handle it.
DARIEN
This is very strange to me.
CARTER
This kind of thing happens to us all the time.
CLONE O'NEILL
So how many Jaffa are we going to have to deal with on that ship?
TEAL'C
As many as one thousand. But that is not the problem.
O'NEILL
What is the problem?
TEAL'C
The rings must be activated from within the ship.
O'NEILL
Now see, you didn't mention that before.
TEAL'C
We had very little time to formulate this plan, O'Neill.
CLONE O'NEILL
It's all right. Carter and Teal'c might be able to help. The other
ones.
O'NEILL
How are they going to know what to do and when?
CLONE O'NEILL
I can communicate with them. I've been maintaining radio silence to
protect my location.
O'NEILL
I don't see a radio.
CLONE O'NEILL
They're internal.
CARTER
So you can actually send a signal to…
CLONE O'NEILL
Wait. Excuse me.
[Clone O'Neill taps his chest.]
CLONE O'NEILL
A little static. They said they'd do what they can.
O'NEILL
What about the Jaffa on the ship?
TEAL'C
Once we have reached the pel'tac, the other levels can be sealed
off. Cronus will have very few Jaffa remaining for support.
CARTER
What do we with the other Jaffa once we've dealt with Cronus and
taken over the ship?
TEAL'C
We offer them freedom.
INT--CRONUS'S SHIP, FLIGHT DECK
[Cronus is standing by the controls. Ja'din enters.]
JA'DIN
My Lord. The machine that resembles the Jaffa Teal'c requests an
audience with you.
CRONUS
For what purpose?
JA'DIN
He claims he wishes to bargain with you for the freedom of the one
called Carter.
CRONUS
What have you learned so far?
JA'DIN
They have been unwilling to co-operate in the analysis. However,
their behaviour is curiously similar to that of humans. Perhaps you
would be more successful in extracting the necessary information?
CRONUS
Bring the one that resembles Teal'c before me.
EXT--GOA'ULD PYRAMID AND VILLAGE
INT--PYRAMID THRONE ROOM.
[A Jaffa enters and bows before Sindar.]
SINDAR
Report?
JAFFA
The intruder has been captured.
[Clone O'Neill is lead in by Darien who is holding a cross bow to his
head.]
INT--CRONUS' SHIP, CAGE ROOM
[Clone Carter is being tortured.]
JA'DIN
Tell me how to operate the power core on that unit and I will stop
damaging you.
Clone CARTER
It's simple. Just touch the two crystals on opposite sides of the
converter.
[Ja'din goes to the Clone Daniel and activates a small unit in his
chest]
JA'DIN
Interesting.
INT--PYRAMID THRONE ROOM.
[Clone O'Neill is standing in front of Sindar. Darien is still behind
him holding the cross bow.]
SINDAR
Cronus will be pleased.
DARIEN
Truth be told, I do not think Cronus will be pleased at all.
[Darien shoots Sindar. Clone O'Neill produces a gun and starts shooting
the Jaffa who shoot back with staff weapons. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c
enter to help. Clone O'Neill is hit by a staff blast. Carter crosses to
Clone O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
You all right?
DARIEN
I am.
CLONE O'NEILL
I'm fine too. Thanks for your concern.
O'NEILL
Are you all right?
[The clone is leaking fluid, clearly badly injured.]
CLONE O'NEILL
A little gas. Yeah, got gas.
INT--CRONUS'S SHIP, THRONE ROOM
[Clone Teal'c is held between two Jaffa.]
CRONUS
What is it you wish to tell me in exchange for the other one's
freedom?
CLONE TEAL'C
I only wish to seek revenge for the death of my father.
[Clone Teal'c punches one Jaffa then attacks the second. He takes a
staff weapon and fires at the first Jaffa. Then he fires at Cronus who
is protected by the Goa'uld defence shield. Clone Teal'c throws down
the staff weapon, grabs Cronus and starts to strangle him.]
INT--CAGE ROOM.
[Clone Carter is kneeling in her laser cage. Ja'din is standing with
the headless Daniel Clone. The unit is raised from the chest and lights
are flashing.]
JA'DIN
Is it now active?
Clone CARTER
In a way.
[Red lights start to come on in sequence around the edge of the unit.]
JA'DIN
What does this mean?
Clone CARTER
I designed it with special sensors to detect when someone was
tampering with the power core. Situations just like this. It's a
self-destruct mode.
[Clone Carter covers her face. The unit explodes out into the
corridor.]
INT--RING TRANSPORTER ROOM
[There are five Jaffa.]
Jaffa 1
Go.
[The Jaffa leave. Jaffa 1 remains and activates a zat gun.]
INT--FLIGHT DECK
[Clone Teal'c is still strangling Cronus. Another Jaffa enters and and
shoots Clone Teal'c in the back with a staff weapon. Clone Teal'c
collapses to the ground.]
INT--RING TRANSPORTER ROOM
[Clone Carter enters. Clone Carter shoots Jaffa 1 with a zat gun and
activates the transporter rings. The rings transport up Carter, O'Neill
and Teal'c.]
O'NEILL
Nice work.
Clone CARTER
Teal'c's in trouble.
TEAL'C
Where?
Clone CARTER
He's on the pel'tac with Cronus.
[Teal'c leaves.]
O'NEILL
We need to seal off this level.
CARTER
Apparently there's a control centre somewhere that services all the
doors. Kinda like a circuit panel.
[Clone Carter leaves. Carter and O'Neill follow.]
INT--FLIGHT DECK
CRONUS
Jaffa Kree!
[A Jaffa hands Cronus a staff weapon. He activates it. Clone Teal'c is
lying on the floor. Teal'c enters and shoots the Jaffa with a zat. He
fires at Cronus around the Jaffa. Cronus is protected by the defence
shield. Cronus shoots Teal'c with the staff weapon through the Jaffa.
Jaffa and Teal'c fall to the floor.]
INT--SHIP'S CORRIDOR
[Clone Carter, Carter and O'Neill are making their way along it.]
Clone CARTER
I've got your six.
[Carter runs to the panel and opens the power unit. Jaffa arrive.
O'Neill shoots the Jaffa.]
INT--FLIGHT DECK
[Cronus steps up to Teal'c who is lying on the floor. Teal'c fights but
he is badly injured with the staff blast to his chest. Cronus starts to
removed Teal'c's symbiote.]
INT--SHIP'S CORRIDOR
[Carter attempts to pull the coloured crystals from the power unit but
she is electrocuted]
CARTER
The crystals are protected by a force shield.
Clone CARTER
Switch with me. I'll do it.
[Carter and Clone Carter swap places.]
Clone CARTER
What do I do?
CARTER
Pull the green crystals out. The doors should close and lock
automatically.
[O'Neill and Carter continue to shoot Jaffa that enter the corridor.
Clone Carter pulls out the crystals, getting electrocuted. The doors
come down. Clone Carter starts to pull out more crystals.]
INT--FLIGHT DECK
[Cronus is pulling out Teal'c's symbiote when he is shot in the back
three times by Clone Teal'c with a staff weapon. Cronus falls to the
floor.]
CLONE TEAL'C
For our father.
[Clone Teal'c collapses to the floor dead.]
INT--SHIP'S CORRIDOR
[O'Neill is continuing to shoot approaching Jaffa. The doors are coming
down one by one as Clone Carter pulls out the crystals but she is being
hurt each time. The final door comes down.]
O'NEILL
That's it.
[Clone Carter turns but she collapses, dead. Carter kneels next to
her.]
INT--PYAMID ON JUNA, THRONE ROOM
[Clone O'Neill is lying on the floor. Darien is dressing his wounds.]
DARIEN
You were very badly damaged.
CLONE O'NEILL
Yes.
DARIEN
But you are a machine. Can you not be mended?
CLONE O'NEILL
Possibly. Darien, I'm running out of energy. I will shut down soon.
DARIEN
I promise, you will never be forgotten.
[The ring transporter transports O'Neill down from the ship]
O'NEILL
Go tell your people Cronus is dead. If they still think he's a God,
have 'em come take a look.
[Darien leaves.]
CLONE O'NEILL
Carter, Teal'c?
O'NEILL
Yours don't look so good. The real ones, they're okay.
CLONE O'NEILL
Are we still so far from real to you?
O'NEILL
No. I guess not.
CLONE O'NEILL
Then I believe we are done.
[Clone O'Neill closes his eyes and dies.]
