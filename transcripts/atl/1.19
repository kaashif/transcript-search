The Siege Part 1
TEASER
EXT--SPACE
[An armada of Wraith hive ships and cruisers enter a hyperspace
window.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay briefs many personnel in front of a display showing the expected
Wraith trajectory.]
MCKAY
Not only has Teyla been able to ascertain that the Wraith are more
interested in Earth than Atlantis -- which is, you know, terrifying
-- she realized that the hive ships will go right past the only
surviving Lagrangian Point satellite.
ZELENKA
The last of what we assume were dozens of defense satellites
destroyed during the Ancients' last stand with the Wraith.
MCKAY
Yes, yes, yes. The point is, we think we can use it to our
advantage.
SHEPPARD
I thought you said it was dead.
MCKAY
It is, but we think we've learned enough about how it works to bring
it back.
ZELENKA
If we are right about what is wrong with it.
MCKAY
Yes, of course, if we're right about what's wrong with it. But if
we're right, and it's just out of power, the Wraith have simply been
ignoring it.
ZELENKA
Our preliminary estimates indicate a single naquadah generator would
be enough to bring it back online.
FORD
Why can't we use our generators to get the weapons systems of
Atlantis working?
ZELENKA
Because those systems were designed to be powered by the zero point
module, and the satellite isn't.
SHEPPARD
And you think it's powerful enough to take out a Wraith hive ship?
MCKAY
Well, according to the Ancient database, it should be able to take
out all three when fully charged. Keep in mind that the Ancient
technology is far superior. They only lost the war because they were
vastly outnumbered.
SHEPPARD
Well, we're vastly outnumbered.
BATES
And outgunned.
ZELENKA
But they don't see the satellite as a threat.
MCKAY
In military parlance, surprise...is an element on our side.
WEIR
What do you need?
MCKAY
The satellite's fifteen hours away by puddle jumper. I recommend
that we put together a small crew. Say, myself, Grodin...and a
pilot.
SHEPPARD
I'll go.
WEIR
No, Miller can handle it. Major, I need you to keep searching for
alternate Alpha sites, just in case this fails.
MCKAY
The hive ships will be in range of the satellite in 49 hours. We're
going to need every last second of that time.
WEIR
Questions? Okay, let's get on it.
[Everyone starts to get up.]
WEIR
Well, Rodney... I don't mean to put any undue pressure, but at this
moment, that satellite is the only thing standing between the Wraith
and Atlantis.
SHEPPARD
(walking past McKay)
No undue pressure.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard and Beckett stand beside Teyla's bedside.]
TEYLA
I am fine.
SHEPPARD
I'm looking for something a little more enthusiastic than "fine."
TEYLA
I am ready to be put back on active duty.
SHEPPARD
I'm sure you think so, but, uh--
TEYLA
Tell him I'm fine.
BECKETT
She is, Major. I see no further reason she should be kept here under
medical supervision.
[Sheppard asses her for a moment.]
SHEPPARD
All right. You're back on active duty.
[Sheppard turns away. Teyla sighs in relief.]
INT--ATLANTIS LAB
[McKay and Zelenka prepare the generator and other items for the
shuttle.]
MCKAY
I think I can handle this alone, Radek. Is there not something
better you could be doing?
ZELENKA
I think I should go.
MCKAY
Yes, I agree. Go.
ZELENKA
I mean on the mission.
MCKAY
Why?
ZELENKA
Sure, you probably know a little bit more about the satellite than I
do--
MCKAY
Generous of you.
ZELENKA
But you know a lot more about the city than I do.
MCKAY
Okay, I think I see where this is going now.
ZELENKA
If, for whatever reason, there is a problem there, it should be me,
not you.
MCKAY
There's not going to be a problem.
ZELENKA
Rodney, you don't know that. There--
MCKAY
If it seems like we can't fix it, we'll just turn around and come
back. Now, I realize I'm invaluable everywhere, but--
ZELENKA
You know what? Forget about it. I take it back. No.
MCKAY
Sorry. Nope. You can't take it back because you've just admitted
that I am smarter than you are.
ZELENKA
I admitted no such thing!
MCKAY
Oh, it was hard for you to say but the truth shone through, and you
were compelled to speak.
ZELENKA
You are a miserable little man.
MCKAY
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's not ruin the moment here, huh? Now...keep
an eye on my city for me while I'm gone, hmm?
[They shake hands.]
ZELENKA
Good luck.
MCKAY
Right. All right.
[McKay wheels the cart of equipment out of the lab.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir, Sheppard, and Bates look at laptops.]
BATES
MA5-393?
SHEPPARD
No, we've only been there at night, and it gets ridiculously hot
during the day, so, no, not really an option.
WEIR
We wouldn't be having this problem if the damn Alpha site that we'd
picked hadn't been marked by the Wraith.
SHEPPARD
They're a real pain in the ass, aren't they?
WEIR
Yes, they are.
SHEPPARD
How about M4H-212?
BATES
Nah, crawling with Genii spies.
SHEPPARD
Do you know that for a fact, Sergeant, or is your "Spidey sense"
just tingling?
BATES
It's a fact, sir.
WEIR
Here we go--M1M-316. Stackhouse reported lush surroundings, and as
far as his team could tell, it seemed uninhabited.
SHEPPARD
I'll get my team together and check it out.
WEIR
Okay, good. Remember, Major, we don't need ideal. I think we'd all
settle for close.
SHEPPARD
I'm on it.
[Sheppard leaves. Bates gets up to follow.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[They walk down the stairs to the control room.]
BATES
Major. Is Teyla coming with you?
SHEPPARD
You're not seriously asking me that.
BATES
I think that's a bad call, sir.
SHEPPARD
Here we go again.
BATES
All I'm saying is we still don't fully understand her connection to
the Wraith, and in my opinion, I don't think we should expose her to
information we wouldn't want the Wraith to have--not the least of
which is the location of our evac site.
SHEPPARD
The doctor gave her a clean bill of health.
BATES
And that's good to hear, Sir, but if she can't control how the
Wraith use her--
SHEPPARD
You don't know that.
BATES
That's right, we don't. She saw everything they saw. Who's to say
they can't do the same with her, see what we see? If she's been
compromised in any way--
SHEPPARD
She's an integral part of my team. Period. End of story. We're done.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS LAB
[Weir has joined Zelenka.]
ZELENKA
This simulation I've put together. It shows how the city will be
destroyed once we trigger the self-destruct.
[A large display shows an animation of the explosions, with the city
breaking into large pieces that then sink to the ocean floor.]
WEIR
So glad you felt I needed to see this. I was just thinking how my
nightmares need to be more vivid.
ZELENKA
It's not going to be enough.
WEIR
What?
ZELENKA
Our self-destruct plan. It's nowhere near effective enough.
WEIR
Now, that seemed pretty effective to me.
ZELENKA
Atlantis is more than just a city. It is an intergalactic
spacecraft.
WEIR
Yes?
ZELENKA
Yes, well, Teyla said the Wraith are not interested in destroying
Atlantis. They're coming here to get to Earth. They can only do that
by going through the Stargate--
WEIR
Which means stealing the city, which is why we have a self-destruct
in place.
ZELENKA
Yes, but if they are even the least bit resourceful, which I must
assume that they are, they can easily reverse engineer their own
intergalactic engine from the wreckage on the sea bottom.
WEIR
So we need a bigger bang? Break into smaller pieces?
ZELENKA
Yes, well, that would certainly help, but I'm more concerned about
the Ancient database. Its ability to back up data is incredibly
redundant.
WEIR
Incredibly redundant.
ZELENKA
Yeah, that one never gets old, but, seriously, if the Wraith recover
even the smallest part of the Ancient database... That is my concern
exactly.
WEIR
All right, how hard would it be to destroy all the database
terminals?
ZELENKA
Impossibly hard. We need to figure out a way to delete the Ancient
database.
WEIR
Well, can you do that?
ZELENKA
I can find out.
WEIR
Okay, find out, but before you wipe anything out, we're going to
have to consider--
BATES
(over radio)
Dr. Weir.
WEIR
(into radio)
Yes?
BATES
We have an unscheduled off-world activation. Major Sheppard is
coming in hot.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Personnel have taken up defensive positions. The 'gate is active.]
WEIR
What's going on?
BATES
They ran into some sort of resistance. I'm thinking Wraith.
WEIR
Wraith? I thought you said this planet was uninhabited.
BATES
It was.
[Sheppard, Ford, and Teyla come through, firing into the wormhole. The
Stargate shuts down.]
BATES
I told you she was a liability, sir. Now, I'm not going to let your
personal feelings endanger this facility any longer.
TEYLA
What?
BATES
Look, I'm not accusing you of doing it intentionally, but the Wraith
must be getting information from you.
SHEPPARD
What the hell are you talking about? We ran into a... What the hell
was that?
FORD
Looked an awful lot like a T-Rex, Sir.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, a T-Rex. Wasn't even a Wraith. So why don't you check those
accusations?
WEIR
I take it you don't recommend the planet as an Alpha site, Major?
SHEPPARD
Wouldn't be my first choice. If McKay doesn't get the satellite on
line, we're screwed.
EXT--SPACE
[The Puddle Jumper flies through space.]
MILLER
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, this is Miller. We're approaching the satellite.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
You're on the other side of the solar system, Lieutenant. You guys
be careful out there.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay is in a space suit while Miller pilots the ship and Grodin sits
in the co-pilot seat.]
MCKAY
Understood.
[McKay puts on his helmet and steps to the aft cabin.]
MCKAY
Okay. Close the bulkhead doors.
MILLER
Good luck.
MCKAY
Right.
GRODIN
Good luck.
[The bulkhead closes.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Jumper approaches the very large defense satellite.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Teyla catches up with Bates.]
TEYLA
Sergeant Bates.
BATES
What is it?
TEYLA
(angry)
You just accused me of disclosing our position to the Wraith.
BATES
(defiant)
Yes, I did.
TEYLA
Clearly you were wrong.
BATES
That's yet to be determined, ma'am.
TEYLA
Excuse me?
BATES
Look, I'm willing to accept that you're not fully in control of what
information you give away, but it's still my opinion that you should
not be allowed to move freely around this base of operations.
TEYLA
Perhaps you are not aware, Sergeant, but being accused of serving
the Wraith is the greatest insult among my people.
BATES
Oh, I'm aware.
[Teyla hits him in the face. Sheppard and Ford arrive.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell is going on here?
[Sheppard and Ford hold Teyla and Bates back from going after each
other again.]
TEYLA
I was simply stating an opinion, Major.
BATES
She attacked me!
TEYLA
And for good reason.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, and what reason would that be?
BATES
My guess would be the Wraith.
SHEPPARD
Walk away, Bates.
BATES
Sir!
SHEPPARD
Walk away!
BATES
This isn't over.
TEYLA
I would be disappointed if it were.
[Bates leaves.]
SHEPPARD
(angry, to Teyla)
What the hell are you doing? You don't go around decking the head of
security.
TEYLA
He said I--
SHEPPARD
I don't care what he said. He says a lot of things. You just stay
away from him.
[Teyla nods and leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Puddle Jumper docks at a docking station of the satellite.]
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[The port opens, and McKay slowly enters the satellite in zero gravity
conditions. The sounds of his breathing is heard as he makes his way
along a connecting corridor.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
GRODIN
You okay?
[The conversation shifts between the satellite transfer tube and the
Puddle Jumper.]
MCKAY
Yes, why?
GRODIN
You're breathing pretty heavily.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, feeling a little claustrophobic. How much air do these
things hold, anyways?
MILLER
Eight hours.
MCKAY
Well, that's enough, right? I mean even with the heavy breathing? I
imagine they would calculate that in, right?
GRODIN
You're going to be fine.
MCKAY
Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one with the
eight-hour ceiling on their breathing.
[Grodin and Miller smile at each other.]
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[McKay floats to the bottom of the tube. He moves around the room and
tries to activate a control panel. Nothing happens.]
MCKAY
It's completely dead.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
GRODIN
Well, we thought as much.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
MCKAY
I'm going to hook up the naquadah generator. See if I can get some
life support going.
[He starts to pull on the tether attached to his suit, to pull the
equipment down.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Halling arrives with other Athosians. Halling goes into Weir's
office.]
WEIR
Halling, hello.
HALLING
May we speak?
WEIR
Please, have a seat. How is the evacuation on the mainland coming?
HALLING
We'll be ready.
WEIR
Good.
HALLING
Dr. Weir, the word is there is a plan in place to destroy Atlantis.
WEIR
There are concerns the Wraith would be able to make it to Earth if
the city is left intact. But I assure you that plan will only be
executed in a worst-case scenario.
HALLING
Such as...three hive ships flying towards Atlantis?
WEIR
We do believe we'll be able to destroy them before they arrive.
HALLING
I understand you fearing for the well being of your people... But it
is not reason to destroy the city of the Ancestors. Atlantis is a
sacred place. To even consider destroying it merely for
self-preservation--
WEIR
Merely for self-preservation?
HALLING
This place is all that remains of the greatest race ever to inhabit
the stars.
WEIR
And you would prefer it fell into the hands of the Wraith?
HALLING
I would have faith that the Ancestors would not allow it to happen.
They have been able to preserve Atlantis for ten thousand years. Is
it not possible--
WEIR
No, I don't think it is possible. Not if you're suggesting the
Ancients will return in time to save their city.
HALLING
You cannot know their plans for Atlantis.
WEIR
They have made all the plans they are going to make. Now it's up to
us. I thank you for your thoughts, Halling, but I have to do
everything I can to make sure the power and technology of Atlantis
does not fall into the hands of the Wraith... And, yes, to ensure
they never make it to my galaxy.
HALLING
Even if it means sacrificing the future of this one?
[Weir is taken aback; Halling gets up and leaves.]
INT--ATLANTIS LAB
ZELENKA
You know, the idea is simple enough. It's the execution that is
proving to be very difficult.
WEIR
You're creating a virus?
ZELENKA
Essentially, yes, a plain old computer virus. Once introduced into
the system, it will wipe the database clean. It could be downloaded
as part of the self-destruct countdown. It might even affect the
Wraith's systems if they try to access it.
WEIR
How much of it could we save?
ZELENKA
I'm sorry?
WEIR
Of the database. We brought a lot of hard drives with us. How much
could we transfer to our computers?
ZELENKA
You mean, like, back it up? Take a copy with us?
WEIR
Yes, exactly.
ZELENKA
Using McKay's compression code, I'd say maybe seven, maybe eight
percent.
WEIR
That's it?
ZELENKA
(surprised at her surprise)
Yes.
EXT--SPACE
[The defense satellite rotates slowly.]
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[McKay is now in a cloth jumpsuit; life support has been restored to
the satellite. Grodin and Miller are with him. They are still
weightless.]
MCKAY
Here we go.
[McKay activates the generator. Lights come on. Grodin floats to a
control panel.]
GRODIN
Primary power online. Looks like life-support's now at one hundred
percent. I think I found the switch to initialize the gravity.
MCKAY
Great, just give me a second to--
[Grodin is already turning on the gravity. McKay falls to the bottom of
the tube.]
MCKAY
(rolling over slowly)
Oh! Oh, yeah. Yep. That's permanent back damage.
GRODIN
Sorry, I...assumed it would come on more slowly.
MCKAY
Well, you assumed with my life.
GRODIN
You'll be fine. It was just a little bump.
MCKAY
What do you got?
GRODIN
(checking his computer)
Looks like every system is back online...except for the weapon.
MCKAY
Ah, details. Let's get to work.
[Grodin helps him up.]
MCKAY
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, yep. That's vertebra damage. That's a
life of pain. Oh.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Sheppard and Ford look at computer screens.]
SHEPPARD
What about M1K-439?
FORD
Which one's that?
SHEPPARD
The one with all the waterfalls.
FORD
Waterfalls. See, now, why don't we just call it "Planet Waterfall?"
What? I say we should just give them names... Look, we've got a list
of five planets here. That should be enough potential Alpha sites to
get Stackhouse and his team started.
VOICE
(over intercom)
Major Sheppard, we have a situation at Generator Station One.
[Sheppard and Ford rush out.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ford meet the Security Officer.]
SHEPPARD
What's the problem?
S.O.
It's Bates, sir.
SHEPPARD
What about him?
S.O.
He's been attacked.
[Bates is lying unconscious, his face bloody.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Get a medical team down here.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Bates is hooked up to medical devices.]
SHEPPARD
Is he going to be okay?
BECKETT
It's still hard to tell. He's got five broken ribs, a fractured
collarbone, and the concussion was quite severe.
SHEPPARD
When can we talk to him?
BECKETT
We can't. I've put him in a medically induced coma until the
subdural hematoma can be dealt with. We won't be finding out what
happened from him any time soon.
FORD
Teyla and Bates got into it pretty bad yesterday, sir.
SHEPPARD
A fistfight and a beating like this are a long drive apart, Ford.
FORD
I understand that, sir, but they were in a fight, and they were both
looking to continue it.
SHEPPARD
Anything pointing to who did this?
BECKETT
I'm having a forensic exam of both his body and clothing performed
right now.
SHEPPARD
Let us know what you find out. Let's go get her side of the story.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[McKay is working one level above Grodin and Miller.]
GRODIN
Well, it's not a power generation problem. The naquadah's pumping
out more than enough juice.
MCKAY
Well, then why isn't it-- Okay. All right. Let's just step back
here. Think about it. This baby is a directed energy beam weapon.
Runs off a relatively low-yield charge, like our naquadah generator.
So that means it's got to be continually building up a charge in
some kind of a buffer or a capacitor until it's discharged.
GRODIN
I think I found something like that. Yes, here it is. Right now, the
buffer's at ninety percent.
MCKAY
Okay, so power is getting to the buffer, it's just not getting to
the actual weapon.
GRODIN
Let me see if I can find a diagnostics program. There must be one
here.
[He searches on the built-in displays.]
MCKAY
Okay, we've got 29 hours till showtime, so let's hope we don't have
to order parts, huh?
INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS
TEYLA
You do not think I had anything to do with it?
SHEPPARD
Of course not.
FORD
You and Bates did get into it pretty good yesterday.
TEYLA
You know me, Aiden. I never would have taken it that far.
FORD
I know, so let's just see if we can't rule it out altogether...
Where were you last night?
TEYLA
I was here, in my room.
FORD
The whole night?
TEYLA
Yes.
SHEPPARD
So there's no way of knowing whether you blacked out or not.
TEYLA
I have no way of proving it, no, but I did not leave this room last
night. I am sure of it... I did not leave this room.
INT--WALKWAY ABOVE GATE ROOM
ZELENKA
You asked to see me?
WEIR
Stackhouse has found a suitable Alpha site, so should the need
arise, we'll be able to evacuate.
ZELENKA
Oh, that's good.
WEIR
That's not why I wanted to see you. You have to get me more than
seven or eight percent of the database. There has got to be a way of
taking more with us.
ZELENKA
Maybe nine percent.
[They walk down the stairs to the 'gate room as they talk.]
WEIR
How do I choose between zero point module research and their work on
ascension? Between weapons schematics and their notes on space
travel? No matter what we choose here, invaluable information is
going to be lost, and that is just the information that we've
deciphered. Now, we all know we have barely even begun to scratch
the surface. What if we destroy the cure for all disease? Or even
some piece of information that could lead to the downfall of the
Wraith?
ZELENKA
I don't know what I can tell you. I will try to improve on McKay's
compression ratios, but... We are at war, Elizabeth. In war, there
are casualties.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[McKay has his laptop connected to the satellite's systems.]
MCKAY
Ha. Schematics, anyone?
GRODIN
Looks like power runs internally from the buffer to the weapon.
MCKAY
I guess our guy took a hit. Must have disrupted the main power
conduit.
GRODIN
We need to reroute the power from our buffer to the actual weapon.
If we can do that, it will arm.
MCKAY
You know, your masterful grip on the blatantly obvious continues to
impress me, Peter.
GRODIN
(sarcastically)
Thank you.
MCKAY
All right. We need to...route power around these damaged circuits.
We do that, we should be laughing. All right, I'm disoriented. Where
are these?
[Grodin is at his own station, also looking at the schematics.]
GRODIN
They're outside.
MCKAY
What?
GRODIN
Look. See?
MCKAY
Oh, great.
GRODIN
Someone will need to EVA.
MCKAY
There's nothing to hang on to.
GRODIN
I'm not saying it would be easy or safe.
MCKAY
Okay. So who goes?
GRODIN
Well, we could draw straws.
MCKAY
Oh, brilliant. Okay, Miller, break out the straws.
GRODIN
It doesn't have to be straws.
MILLER
Hey, we could do rock, paper, scissors.
MCKAY
Okay. On three. One, two, three... Okay. Obviously rock, paper,
scissors, doesn't work with three. Anyone have a pencil?
MILLER
Yeah, I think I've got one.
MCKAY
Well, get on with it.
[Miller turns his back and breaks the pencil into three pieces.]
MILLER
Okay... short piece goes.
MCKAY
(to Grodin)
You go first.
[Grodin chooses a long piece.]
MCKAY
Mm. Well done. Good for you.
[McKay chooses a piece. It is very short.]
MCKAY
Miller?
[Miller's piece is also longer than McKay's.]
MCKAY
Yeah.
MILLER
You're the best qualified to fix it anyway, sir.
MCKAY
Mm, flatter the dead man. Good.
EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Sheppard and Ford brief Weir.]
SHEPPARD
I know there's no love lost between her and Bates, but I can't see
her beating the hell out of the guy.
WEIR
Ford?
FORD
Ma'am?
WEIR
What do you think?
FORD
I worry about what she might have done unknowingly. The whole
Wraith-connection thing and her nightmares make me nervous.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, well, what are we going to do about it? Stick her in the brig?
This is Teyla we're talking about.
[Beckett comes running in.]
BECKETT
We have a situation on our hands.
WEIR
What's going on?
BECKETT
I completed the tests. I found DNA on Sergeant Bates's uniform.
SHEPPARD
And it's not Teyla's?
BECKETT
No, Major.
WEIR
Who is it?
BECKETT
I ran the test twice to be certain. It's conclusive. We have a
Wraith in the city.
[Everyone reacts with shocked silence.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Sheppard enters, geared up.]
SHEPPARD
Someone tell me how this is possible. How can a Wraith get inside
the city?
FORD
They didn't gate in.
ZELENKA
The dart.
SHEPPARD
What?
ZELENKA
The Wraith dart that scanned us. It made its way through the city,
scanning for data. The second it was done, it self-destructed.
[As he speaks, a replay of the Dart flying over the city and exploding
is shown.]
SHEPPARD
So they beamed into the city?
FORD
Can they do that?
TEYLA
The same technology that is used to sweep people up and into their
ships must work in the opposite way.
WEIR
So the pilot of the Wraith dart scanned us, transmitted his
information to the hive ships, beamed down here, and destroyed his
ship?
ZELENKA
Yes, yes, it seems plausible.
TEYLA
That is precisely the time I started to sense the Wraith
continually.
SHEPPARD
No wonder you were having nightmares.
WEIR
What's he been doing here all this time?
ZELENKA
Well, Sergeant Bates was attacked near the naquadah generator that
powers this tower.
SHEPPARD
The Wraith must have been doing recon. Maybe his job is to knock out
the power before the hive ship gets here; leave us dead in the
water.
FORD
Or to make sure any self-destruct plan we had in place wouldn't
work.
WEIR
Maybe a combination of both.
BECKETT
Exactly.
WEIR
What we do know for sure is that we have a Wraith intruder in the
city that we have to track down.
ZELENKA
I have an idea.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[The Puddle Jumper undocks from the station.]
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[Grodin is at a computer display.]
MILLER
(over radio)
We're away.
GRODIN
It's not much more than 30 meters away.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay is in the rear compartment, wearing his space suit.]
MILLER
(over radio)
We're in position, sir.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Okay, Miller. I want you to vent the atmosphere and disengage the
artificial gravity in the rear compartment.
[In front compartment, Miller does so. In rear compartment, McKay
starts to float.]
MCKAY
Okay. Open the rear hatch.
[The hatch opens. McKay looks out.]
MCKAY
Oh, my.

(concerned)
Rodney? Rodney, did you make it?
[The conversation switches between the satellite control room and
McKay's position.]
MCKAY
Haven't quite left the rear of the jumper yet.
GRODIN
Do I need to remind you of the time?
MCKAY
Yes, please do. Remind me. Are we on a tight schedule?
GRODIN
Just pointing out the obvious.
MCKAY
Okay. Thank you. One small step, huh?
[McKay pushes off.]
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[McKay moves across open space toward the satellite. He grabs onto the
structure.]
MCKAY
One giant leap!
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
I'm sorry?
MCKAY
I made it.
GRODIN
Good.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
MCKAY
Let's take a look at this first panel.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka inserts different crystals into a control console.]
ZELENKA
This is a biometrics sensor we've had online for the past month or
so. It detects irregularities in biometric rhythm and reports them.
SHEPPARD
Wouldn't it have picked up on the Wraith?
ZELENKA
Well, it requires significant amounts of power, so we've narrowed
its field of focus to scan solely in the 'gate room, figuring that
was the only place that the Wraith, or any other alien, for that
matter, would likely enter the city from.
SHEPPARD
Okay, so that was wrong.
ZELENKA
Yep. Now, if I could only expand the scanning field to--
[He does so. A red dot shows on the city schematic.]
ZELENKA
My god.
SHEPPARD
What?
ZELENKA
That's him. Look.
[The red dot blinks near many white ones.]
BECKETT
It works very much like a life signs detector but it's able to
distinguish different life forms.
SHEPPARD
That's him?
ZELENKA
That's him.
SHEPPARD
You can track him in real time?
ZELENKA
Yes.
SHEPPARD
Ford, Teyla, we need two teams. Let's go get him.
FORD
Yes, sir.
[They move out.]
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[McKay has found a large blast hole in the hull of the satellite.]
MCKAY
This is bad. Very bad. I'm not sure I can fix this.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
You can fix anything.
[The conversation switches between the satellite control room and
McKay's position on the hull.]
MCKAY
Who told you that?
GRODIN
You did, on several occasions.
MCKAY
Well, you're right. It's probably a good thing I drew the short
straw.
GRODIN
That's more like it.
[McKay pulls off a conduit cover.]
MCKAY
The main power conduit's been severed. There may be some way for me
to reroute it so it's going through secondary conduits sort of
like...a quadruple bypass.
GRODIN
I should be able to help you identify potential secondary conduits
from here.
MCKAY
We're only going to have time to try this once. Let's get started.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Is he still in place, Doc?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka and Weir monitor the Wraith movement on the schematic.]
ZELENKA
(into radio)
Yes, he's still in the same room. Hasn't moved since we located him.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Let's hope he's still sleeping. Ford, Teyla, are you in position?
TEYLA
(over radio)
Almost.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
My team's ready. We're going to breach the room at the same time
from different directions. If he tries to get out the other door,
take him.
FORD
(over radio)
Understood, sir. We shouldn't be more than a couple minutes.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right. Stand by.
[Sheppard holds with two other crewman. The door to the Wraith position
opens. Sheppard steps forward. He and the other man are shot with
Wraith stunners. They fall unconscious. The Wraith appears and steps
toward them.]
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
MCKAY
Okay, that's all I can do from here. Is the power getting through?
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
Yes, the power is getting through.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
MCKAY
Oh, thank God. Okay, I'm going to end this EVA. We're coming in.
We're going to pick you up and get the hell out of here.
GRODIN
Sounds like a plan.
MCKAY
All right.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard wakes to see the Wraith standing above him. The Wraith kneels
down and rips Sheppard's tee-shirt at the collar. Sheppard is too
paralyzed by the stunner to react.]
WRAITH
Nothing will keep us from our new feeding ground.
[It raises its feeding hand but is shot with an anti-Wraith beam from
behind. Ford, Teyla and others rush in.]
FORD
You were on VOX, Sir. We heard the whole thing and double-timed it.
[Teyla kneels beside Sheppard.]
TEYLA
We got him, Major. You're going to be okay.
[Sheppard closes his eyes.]
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[The Puddle Jumper moves into docking position.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay, his helmet off, walks to the forward section of the Jumper.]
MCKAY
Peter, we're having trouble docking with the satellite. See what you
can do from your side.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
Oh, dear.
MCKAY
(over radio)
"Oh, dear," what?
GRODIN
When we rerouted power from the buffer to the weapon, it looks like
we inadvertently routed power away from the docking station and the
air lock. That's going to be a problem.
[The conversation switches between the satellite control room and the
Jumper.]
MCKAY
All right, well, we'll do it manually, like we did the first time.
GRODIN
You had a space suit the first time. I don't. The air lock isn't
pressurized.
MCKAY
Then we'll... Look, I'll go back and reroute the power.
GRODIN
There isn't time for that. The Wraith ships are too close.
MCKAY
I know what I'm doing now.
GRODIN
Rodney...leave me.
MCKAY
No, we're not doing that.
GRODIN
Look, get to a safe distance and then come get me once the satellite
has taken care of the Wraith ships.
MCKAY
Peter--
GRODIN
It's the only option and you know it. Besides, this way, I can power
down the satellite until they're well within range. Then there'll be
no way for the Wraith to realize we've brought it back online.
MCKAY
All right, we'll cloak and come back for you after it's done.
GRODIN
After it's done, then.
EXT--ATLANTIS, MORNING
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[Ford paces around the cage that holds the Wraith. Sheppard arrives
with Teyla.]
FORD
Good to see you on your feet, sir. How are you feeling?
SHEPPARD
You know, pins and needles. I hate getting stunned by those damn
things. Has he said anything yet?
FORD
No, sir. Not yet.
[Sheppard addresses the Wraith.]
SHEPPARD
Have you got a name? ...Okay, we'll go with Bob. Bob, I'm going to
need to know what you've been doing here for the past two weeks, and
I'm going to need to know now.
[The Wraith growls in response.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Wraith fleet drops out of hyperspace near the satellite.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(to Grodin)
If you're not already powered up, now would be a good time.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[The lights come on inside the satellite.]
GRODIN
Powering up.
(checking a monitor)
We should be weapons-hot in sixty seconds.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
Dr. Weir, it's McKay. The satellite is armed and ready. It should
fire within the next minute or so. Keep your fingers crossed.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Fingers crossed. Good luck.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
FORD
I don't think he's in a very talkative mood, sir.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, I need to know what he's been doing and whether or not he's
been transmitting back to the hive ships.
FORD
Wouldn't we have picked up a transmission?
SHEPPARD
We can send secure messages. There's no reason he can't.
TEYLA
Maybe I can try and connect with him.
SHEPPARD
I don't think so.
TEYLA
If the Alpha site has been compromised, Major, we need to know.
SHEPPARD
(reluctantly)
Okay. See what you can do.
[Teyla faces the cage and goes into a trance. She opens her eyes and
stares at the Wraith.]
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
Switching over from manual to automatic firing mode. Stand by.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Standing by.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and the others wait.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay and Miller watch.]
EXT--SPACE
[The satellite fires on a Wraith hive ship, cutting it in half. It
explodes.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MILLER
Yes!
MCKAY
We have a kill!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone cheers.]
WEIR
We copy that, Rodney!
MCKAY
(over radio)
One down, two to go!
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
WRAITH
What are you doing, human? You're trying to get inside my mind.
Allow me.
[The Wraith stares at Teyla. After a moment, she gasps, grabs her head,
and falls to the floor.]
SHEPPARD
Teyla, stop it! Break it off!
[Sheppard pulls out his pistol and fires at the Wraith. The connection
breaks.]
FORD
(to Teyla)
Are you okay?
[Teyla nods.]
WRAITH
My wounds will heal.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, but for how long?
[Sheppard shoots the Wraith four more times.]
SHEPPARD
I need to know what you've done to this city.
[Sheppard fires twice more.]
WRAITH
Aah!
[Sheppard re-loads his pistol.]
SHEPPARD
Listen, Bob... I have no problem with killing you whatsoever.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[The Wraith fleet is getting closer to the satellite.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Come on, come on. Hit them again!
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
[Sparks are flying inside the satellite.]
GRODIN
We have a problem.
MCKAY
(over radio)
What? What problem?
GRODIN
It looks like the circuit we rerouted has overloaded. The weapon
can't fire again. I'm trying to find another pathway.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
We're heading back in to pick you up.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
Stay exactly where you are!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Look, we're cloaked. They won't see us.
INT--DEFENSE SATELLITE
GRODIN
There's no time. Just get the hell out of here! ...I'm sorry.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(to Miller)
Get us back to that satellite.
EXT--DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE
[The Wraith ships fire on the satellite, destroying it in moments.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Oh, god!
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
SHEPPARD
I'm not screwing around, Bob! Did you sabotage this base or not?
[He fires on the Wraith again.]
WRAITH
Those who feed upon you will know what you've done to me.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. We'll see.
FORD
Sir I think maybe we've gone a bit too far.
SHEPPARD
I don't think we've gone far enough.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(upset, into radio)
Atlantis, this is McKay. We have lost the satellite.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone is shocked.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Did you manage to take out any more ships?
[The conversation switches between the Atlantis control room and the
Jumper.]
MCKAY
Negative. Two other hive ships are intact. Elizabeth...Peter Grodin
was aboard the satellite.
[Zelenka puts his head in his hands.]
WEIR
Understood. What's the status of the other two?
MCKAY
They're not coming any closer. It looks like they're rethinking
their plans. At the very least...he has bought us some time.
WEIR
You can't do any more out there, Rodney. Return to Atlantis.
MCKAY
We're on our way.
WEIR
(to Technician)
Put me on citywide.
(over intercom)
May I have your attention, please? This is Dr. Weir. Our plan to
stop the Wraith armada has failed. They will make it to Atlantis.
Therefore, we must begin our evacuation plans. I wish I could tell
you all that this is a fight that we will win, but I can't do that.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[Sheppard listens while holding a gun, while the Wraith hisses in
laughter.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
I wish I could tell you that we will find a safe harbor when we
leave here. I can't promise you that, either. I can tell you this...
Up to now, you all have accomplished extraordinary things, and I
believe that even in the face of an uncertain future, as long as we
stay together, we have a chance to continue to do so. Now, we all
have our evacuation duties, so thank you, and I'll see you on the
other side.
[She nods to the technician, who turns off the intercom.]
WEIR
Dr. Zelenka put the virus program on standby.
[Zelenka does so, and his computer starts to beep in warning.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
WRAITH
I will tell you this... No matter where you flee, we will find you,
just as surely as we will find Earth. And when we do...we will
feast.
[Sheppard shoots and kills the Wraith.]
