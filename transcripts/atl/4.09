TEASER
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Zelenka and several other scientists sit at their laptops. McKay
stands before a whiteboard covered with writing, studying a formula.]
MCKAY
Huh. Maybe if we...um...No... Nope. Huh.
FEMALE SCIENTIST
Why don't we bring the Wraith in on this?
MCKAY
No.
FEMALE SCIENTIST
A lot of this new nanite coding is based on his calculations, so
maybe--
MCKAY
A) He wouldn't help us. B) We don't need his help. And C) Somebody
get me a coffee.
FEMALE SCIENTIST
You've been silently staring at that board for three hours.
MCKAY
Eh, it'll come to me.
ZELENKA
(frustrated)
Just e-mail her already.
[The other scientists shift uncomfortably as they continue to watch
with interest. McKay turns around slowly to face Zelenka.]
MCKAY
Excuse me?
ZELENKA
Rodney, we're stuck. We've been stuck for ten hours. Just ask her
for help. Please.
MCKAY
I'm not stuck.
ZELENKA
The last time we had a block like this, she helped us through it,
right?
MCKAY
That was for something completely different!
ZELENKA
I cannot sit here waiting for you to have an epiphany! I'm losing
the will to live!
MCKAY
(thinking)
I suppose there could be more important things I should be working
on.
ZELENKA
(talking quickly)
However you want to sell it to yourself, that's fine.
[He slaps his laptop shut and leaves. Everyone else quickly follows
suit. McKay is soon the only one in the room.]
MCKAY
Hmm.
EXT--MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C. CANADA, EARTH, DAY
INT--KITCHEN, MILLER HOME
[The Miller family of Kaleb Miller, his wife Jeanie, and their daughter
Madison are all in the kitchen. Madison is pushing a large slab of
cookie dough onto a baking sheet.]
MADISON
Dad, done!
MILLER
Just one big cookie?
MADISON
Yep.
JEANIE
Don't you want to use your cutters?
MADISON
Nah, I just want a big one.
[The parents laugh. The laptop on the counter chimes.]
JEANIE
Oh.
[She goes to check the computer.]
MILLER
You may want to flatten the dough a little bit.
[He goes to help her.]
MADISON
No.
MILLER
No? Just a giant cookie mountain, that's what you're going for?
MADISON
Yeah.
MILLER
Okay.
(to Jeanie)
Anything good?
JEANIE
It's from my brother. He's stuck again. Do you mind if I...?
MILLER
(waving her to stay with the laptop)
Yeah, I got this.
(to Madison)
Here, you want to help with mine?
MADISON
Okay.
MILLER
Okay.
MADISON
I need a lot of flour.
[Jeanie grabs a notepad and starts writing calculations as Miller works
with Madison.]
MILLER
Oh. How 'bout some more chocolate chips?
MADISON
But not the whole bowl.
MILLER
No, that-that would be too many.
EXT--MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C., CANADA, EARTH, NIGHT
INT--MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME
[Jeanie rolls over in bed and opens her eyes to see Miller lying awake,
looking concerned.]
JEANIE
You can't sleep?
MILLER
I thought I heard something?
JEANIE
Madison?
MILLER
I don't know. I'm going to check it out.
[He gets out of bed.]
JEANIE
She probably just snuck downstairs for more cookies.
MILLER
(chuckling)
That's actually not a bad idea.
[Before he gets to the bedroom door, it bursts open. Two men dressed
all in black and wearing ski masks and goggles enter. They are heavily
armed with laser sights on their weapons. Miller is forced to the
floor. Jeanie whimpers and cowers in the bed as one of them aims his
gun at her head.]
ASSAILANT
You're coming with us.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[NID Agent Barrett waits at the bottom of the Gate ramp as McKay,
Sheppard, and Ronon arrive through the active wormhole. McKay is
wearing civilian clothing, while Sheppard and Ronon are dressed as
usual. McKay is carrying a backpack.]
BARRETT
Gentlemen. I'm Agent Barrett. I work with the NID. Mr. Woolsey has
asked me to help you any way that I can. I'm sorry that we couldn't
meet under better circumstances.
MCKAY
Have the kidnappers tried to make contact with us yet?
BARRETT
No, I'm afraid not.
MCKAY
Okay, well I need to get to Vancouver.
BARRETT
Okay, the Daedalus is in orbit, so it will be a quick trip.
[He leads them out of the room.]
SHEPPARD
Have you learned any new information yet?
BARRETT
No, not yet. The NID is liaising with CSIS on the ground. They are
expecting us.
SHEPPARD
C-what, now?
MCKAY
Canadian Security Intelligence Services. They're...kinda like our
CIA.
SHEPPARD
"CSIS." That's the best you guys can do, huh?
[Barrett leads them all into the elevator, noting their outfits. McKay
is in civilian garb, but Sheppard has on his black BDUs, and Ronon is
wearing his usual leather outfit.]
BARRETT
We will be out in the open, so...perhaps a change of clothes first?
[Ronon looks down at himself.]
RONON
What?
EXT--SUBURBAN STREET, VANCOUVER, B.C, CANADA, DAY
[A sedan parks on the street. Several law enforcement vehicles and
personnel are around. McKay, Sheppard, Barrett, and Ronon get out.
Sheppard wears black slacks and a jacket with a white button down
shirt. Ronon is dressed identically, except he wears jeans.]
RONON
I look dumb.
SHEPPARD
It helps you blend in a little.
RONON
I'm gonna stand out no matter what you dress me in.
SHEPPARD
That's a good point.
[As they enter the Miller home, one of the bystanders watching the
activity takes a keen interest in the newcomers and starts dialing his
cell phone.]
INT--LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME
[Forensic specialists and other law enforcement are scattered
throughout the home. Miller sits on his couch, next to Madison. He sees
McKay and the others enter.]
MILLER
Hey, look. It's your Uncle Mer.
MCKAY
Hey, lady.
MILLER
You going to say hi?
MADISON
Where's Mom?
MCKAY
Uh...I...she...
MILLER
I told you she-she's had to go away for a bit, but she's going to
come back soon, okay?
(to McKay)
Can I, uh...?
[He gestures to speak privately.]
MCKAY
Yeah.
MILLER
(to Madison)
Okay, Sweetie.
[Sheppard joins Madison. McKay and Miller move into the kitchen.]
INT--KITCHEN, MILLER HOME
MILLER
Who did this?
MCKAY
We're not sure, but we have the best people in the world working on
this and all the resources of--
MILLER
(upset)
You know, when y-you came back here last year, she almost didn't go
back with you to Atlantis. I-I said, "Go. You have to do it. You'll
regret not going."
MCKAY
I know you did.
MILLER
She knew it was going to be dangerous, but you two are so
competitive.
MCKAY
Listen to me. We're gonna--
MILLER
This is your fault, Rodney.
MCKAY
Hey, just a second.
MILLER
She got kidnapped because of you.
MCKAY
Okay, we do not know that for sure!
MILLER
We don't? Really? You-you figure four masked men with guns broke in
her to steal her secret apple dumpling recipe? A jealous neighbor,
maybe?
MCKAY
Okay, you're angry. You have every right to be...
MILLER
(half to himself)
If something happens to her...
MCKAY
Kaleb? We're gonna find her.
KALEB
(pleading)
Just...bring her back. Bring-bring her home.
MCKAY
I will.
INT--LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME
[Miller reenters and moves to where Sheppard has been entertaining
Madison.]
MILLER
Come on, Mad.
MADISON
Where we going?
MILLER
Just away for a bit.
[He picks her up, and they leave. McKay rejoins Barrett, Sheppard, and
Ronon.]
MCKAY
I told him to get a hotel. There's no reason for them to stick
around here.
BARRETT
All right, thanks, guys. Give us the room, please.
[The remaining law enforcement officials pack up and leave.]
BARRETT
So, where do you want to start?
MCKAY
Jeanie and I were corresponding by e-mail. Um, she was, uh...I was
bouncing some ideas off her.
BARRETT
What about?
MCKAY
Well, before Sheppard's Wraith showed up, I was trying to perfect my
nanite medical program.
[Sheppard looks surprised.]
RONON
That thing you used to save Weir?
MCKAY
Yeah, a better, more complex version of that, but yeah. Of course,
as soon as we found out that the Replicators were attacking human
worlds throughout the galaxy, we obviously switched our focus to
shutting them down once and for all.
BARRETT
And you sent Jeanie the program that you were working on?
MCKAY
Yeah. I just-I needed a new set of eyes.
SHEPPARD
The question is, what does it have to do with her being taken?
MCKAY
Yeah. Well, maybe the Trust or some other Earth-based organization
wanted info on me or about the Program. But regardless, my e-mail
and her capture happened too close together not to be connected.
BARRETT
Right. That sounds like a good place to start.
MCKAY
Has anyone touched her computer?
BARRETT
No. No, I-I told them that you wanted to take a look at it first.
Nobody's touched it.
[He sits by her laptop.]
MCKAY
I'm gonna need to take it apart. This is going to take some time.
Why don't you go back to the hotel? I'll call you if I find
anything.
SHEPPARD
It's okay. We'll stay.
MCKAY
Seriously. This could take ten to twelve hours. I'm just-there's
nothing you can do here. Just go back to the hotel. I'll call you if
I find anything.
[Ronon and Sheppard exchange looks but back off, leaving McKay working
on the laptop.]
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[Two men dressed in black combat gear bring Jeanie into the room. Her
hands are tied in front of her and a black bag is over her head. One
guard leads her to a chair and sits her down. He takes off the bad and
they leave. Jeanie is disoriented, but gets up and heads over to the
door.]
WALLACE
Here.
[She spins to see Wallace. She hadn't noticed him before. He walks
over, holding a knife.]
JEANIE
No. Wait! Please.
WALLACE
Shh. It's all right. Let me?
[He gestures, and Jeanie holds still. He cuts her hands free. She
instantly backs away.]
JEANIE
Who are you?
WALLACE
My name is Henry Wallace. I'm sorry to have...I need you to do some
work for me.
EXT--VANCOUVER MOTEL, NIGHT
INT--HOTEL ROOM
[Ronon and Sheppard sit in the room. A cell phone rings. Sheppard gets
up to answer it.]
SHEPPARD
(into phone)
Hello?
INT--BARRETT'S CAR
[Barrett drives, while McKay sits in the passenger seat, talking on the
phone.]
MCKAY
(into phone)
So, someone was monitoring my sister's computer. I think I've
cracked their Trojan. And I've got an address. Barrett and I are on
our way there now.
[The rest of the conversation takes place switching between the two
locations.]
SHEPPARD
I thought you said it was going to take ten hours.
MCKAY
Hey, even I underestimate how smart I am sometimes.
SHEPPARD
All right, stay at the house, and-and we'll all go together.
MCKAY
It's too late, we're almost there. I'll give you an address. You can
meet us.
[Sheppard sighs and grabs a notepad.]
SHEPPARD
What is it?
EXT--WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, NIGHT
[McKay and Barrett walk to a building.]
MCKAY
This looks like the place.
BARRETT
Shouldn't we wait for Sheppard and Ronon?
[McKay makes a dismissive gesture.]
MCKAY
Okay, stand back.
[McKay moves to kick open the door. As he does, Barrett tries the knob.
It's unlocked, and he opens the door.]
MCKAY
Okay, well that works, too.
[Barrett unholsters his pistol. McKay doesn't wait and charges in. He
glances back at Barrett.]
MCKAY
You wouldn't happen to have another one of those on you, do you?
BARRETT
Yeah, I got a shotgun in the car.
[Barrett backs up, but gets surprised by a gunman, dressed like the
ones who raided the Miller home. He's knocked down, and another gunman
aims his rifle at a surprised McKay.]
EXT--WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, NIGHT
[Sheppard and Ronon's SUV drives through the streets. They arrive at
the address to find Barrett lying on the street, his head bleeding.
There is no sign of McKay or anyone else.]
SHEPPARD
You okay? What the hell happened?
BARRETT
(wincing in pain)
Two men. They must have been following us.
RONON
McKay!
BARRETT
He's not here. They took him.
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[The armed men lead McKay into the room. His hands are tied behind his
back and the bag is over his head. Jeanie stands when she sees him.
They take off the bag and release his hands.]
JEANIE
Meredith?
MCKAY
Jeanie! Thank god you're alive!
[As the men leave them, McKay moves to his sister and they embrace.]
JEANIE
What are you doing here?
MCKAY
I came back to Earth as soon as I heard you'd were kidnapped.
JEANIE
Have you seen Madison and Kaleb?
MCKAY
Yes. They're, uh, they're a little shaken, but they're okay. I put a
security detail on them, so you don't have to worry.
JEANIE
Then, how did you...?
MCKAY
I got ambushed trying to track down the guys who took you.
JEANIE
(rolling her eyes)
Oh, great. That's just great. First you get me captured, then you--
MCKAY
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you captured?! How do you figure that?
JEANIE
Oh, come on! They were monitoring my computer, right?
MCKAY
Yeah. So?
JEANIE
So would I be here if you hadn't sent me those e-mails?
MCKAY
Possibly.
JEANIE
Meredith!
MCKAY
(distracted by the room)
What is this, a lab?
JEANIE
(sarcastic)
Wow, that's great detective work there, Nancy Drew.
MCKAY
Where the hell are we?
JEANIE
I have no idea. They-they put me on a plane...
[McKay starts playing with the computers.]
MCKAY
Yeah, me too. Any idea who's behind any of this?
[Wallace enters with some guards.]
WALLACE
Doctor McKay. I've heard a lot about you. It's a pleasure.
[He puts out his hand to shake. McKay backs up and says nothing.]
WALLACE
I thought you might show up if your sister...went missing. We
couldn't count on it, of course, but it's a pretty big bonus.
MCKAY
Bonus? Look, I have no idea who you are, but you have made a
terrible mistake bringing me here. Now, I suggest you let us both go
right now, otherwise about a hundred marines are going to come
kicking down your front door in the next two minutes.
WALLACE
I'm pretty sure they won't, actually. Your subcutaneous transmitter
has been deactivated.
[McKay's face falls.]
MCKAY
Who are you?
WALLACE
I should've started with that. My name is Henry Wallace. I'm the
president of...
MCKAY
DMT. Great.
WALLACE
You know who I am, then.
MCKAY
(tightly)
I'm familiar with your work.
JEANIE
What's DMT?
MCKAY
It's Devlin Medical Technologies. They're a predominantly
government-funded contractor. And unfortunately for us, they
manufacture our subcutaneous transmitters.
JEANIE
Oh, great.
MCKAY
Yeah. How do you even know I exist? Your company is only privy to
very basic information about newly declassified experiments the
military's working on.
WALLACE
No, more accurately, my company is given limited access to alien
advances discovered through the Stargate program, and is asked to
integrate them into Earth-based technology.
MCKAY
(shocked)
You're not cleared to know that.
WALLACE
No, I'm not. But after years of being...stupefied by the military's
endless and unbelievable advances, I started to do a little digging.
That's how I found out about the SGC, Atlantis, you...and that's why
we've been monitoring your family's e-mails for quite some time now.
MCKAY
What do you want from me?
WALLACE
I've hit a wall and need some help.
INT--MEDICAL WING
[Wallace leads McKay and Jeanie to stand outside a patient room. A
doctor monitors a teenage girl, lying on the bed.]
WALLACE
My daughter. Sharon.
MCKAY
What's wrong with her?
WALLACE
She's suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia.
MCKAY
Well, I'm very sorry, but, uh...
WALLACE
She's been particularly unresponsive to induction chemotherapy,
Prednisone, Vincristine, cranial irradiation...
MCKAY
I don't even know what all that means. How am I supposed to help?
WALLACE
Look, the best doctors in the world have told her to start saying
her good-byes. Begin making funeral plans.
MCKAY
That's what I'm saying. Neither of us are doctors. Look, yes, I have
a PhD--two actually...
WALLACE
The latest project my company has been working on for the SGC
involves applying advances in nanotechnology to cure injury and
disease. We were close to a prototype.
MCKAY
(realizing)
Wait a second. Wait...
WALLACE
Sharon was injected with the first batch of nanites one week ago.
MCKAY
You've barely got manufacturing perfected. I'm working on the
coding. It-it's months away! They're not ready!
WALLACE
My team thought they'd ironed out most of the coding.
MCKAY
"Ironed out?" It's not that easy!
WALLACE
I know that...now. They're malfunctioning.
MCKAY
Well, of course they are.
WALLACE
And it's not just that they're not working. They're...they're
actually causing more problems than the cancer. Her body is
rejecting them. When I intercepted your correspondence with Jeanie,
I desperately needed someone familiar with the coding to come fix
the programming.
MCKAY
Right, so Jeanie was just the bait.
WALLACE
No. From what I could tell, she had a firmer grasp of the coding
than you did.
MCKAY
(offended)
I don't think it's fair to judge me on a couple of e-mails. I mean,
they don't reflect the entire--
JEANIE
Meredith! It doesn't matter.
WALLACE
If we don't do something quickly, Sharon's going to die. Get the
nanites fully operational, and I'll let you go.
MCKAY
(skeptical)
Really?
WALLACE
Absolutely.
MCKAY
And if we don't?
[Wallace smiles.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Barrett, Sheppard and Ronon stand in the room. Harriman speaks to
someone on a monitor.]
HARRIMAN
(into comm)
That's right, sir. They must've neutralized the transmitter.
RONON
What about the lead you were following?
BARRETT
Uh,...dead end. It's a small, rented room with a router that ported
data to a site in Singapore. I mean, who knows where it was
forwarded from there. We've got our best IT guys on the job, though.
We're going to start tracing the paper trail, and hopefully it's
going to turn up a lead. We've been combing the security, traffic,
and ABM cameras from the area where we got ambushed, talking to
witnesses. We've got half the Vancouver P.D. on this one. We're
going to get 'em.
[He leaves.]
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[McKay and Jeanie both work on computers. One monitor shows Sharon
unconscious in the medical wing.]
JEANIE
They're not communicating.
MCKAY
What?
JEANIE
The nanites. That's what causing all the problems. They're going
after some cells redundantly. They're ignoring others. They've
caused at least three partially clogged arteries...Something in
their coding is stopping them from understanding each other.
MCKAY
(distracted)
Great, great.
JEANIE
Are you even listening to me?
MCKAY
Eh, you lost me at "nanites".
JEANIE
(snapping her fingers)
Hey, idiot! We need to solve this coding problem.
MCKAY
No, what we need to do is get the hell out of here.
JEANIE
(slowly)
I know. By solving the coding problem.
MCKAY
So young, and so naive.
JEANIE
You got a better idea?
MCKAY
Yes! Look, they gave us these computers network access so we could
monitor Sharon in real time, right? Which means I can also hack into
the security mainframe.
JEANIE
What about Sharon?
MCKAY
What about us?
JEANIE
We can do this, Mer. We can help this girl!
MCKAY
And then what? He's just going to let us go? Wha-you think he's just
going to give up his life...uh...lose his company, get carted off to
prison? You think he'll be fine with that?
JEANIE
He's desperate. I think any parent would understand.
MCKAY
Oh, you think. All right, let's just for a second imagine that we
live in this magical land of unicorns and wizards and kind-hearted
people who you can take at their word. Let's assume that he lets us
go if we save her. But what if we fail, huh? What if she dies? How
happy do you think he'll be then? You think he'll just let us waltz
out the door with an "aw shucks, well better luck next time, tiger"
attitude, huh?
[Jeanie doesn't respond, but her body language indicates she sees his
point.]
MCKAY
Exactly. We need to get out here. I've been working on a code to
unlock all the keypad doors. You ready?
[He stands and still presses keys.]
JEANIE
What happens after you get the door open?
MCKAY
Well, I memorized the building's layout from this computer here.
[Jeanie sighs in resignation.]
JEANIE
Okay.
[He presses some buttons and the doors unlock, opening slightly.]
JEANIE
(surprised)
Huh.
MCKAY
(whispering)
C'mon.
[He moves to the door, checking that the coast is clear.]
MCKAY
Come.
INT--HALLWAYS
[McKay and Jeanie sneak through the halls. Jeanie tries a door, but
it's locked.]
JEANIE
(whispering)
You said there was a stairway entrance here.
MCKAY
(whispering)
Well, there's supposed to be. Okay. Wait. Wait-wait-wait. Uh, we
gotta go back.
JEANIE
Go back?!
MCKAY
Because I got all mixed around. We've got to start again. Maybe what
I thought was north was south. It's hard to tell.
JEANIE
I can't believe I am betting my life on your sense of direction.
MCKAY
What are you talking about? I have an excellent sense of direction.
JEANIE
Oh really? Remember when we went to West Edmonton Mall, and Dad had
to call the police to find you?
MCKAY
That mall is huge!
JEANIE
There are maps every seven meters!
MCKAY
Misleading ones. Now c'mon. We've got to go back.
INT--SECURITY ROOM
[Wallace enters and looks at the monitor for the computer lab. He sees
it is empty. He picks up the phone.]
INT--HALLWAY
[Klaxons blare.]
MCKAY
Oh shoot!
[They start to run. Security come around a corner. They spin around and
run the other way. The guard fires what looks like a pistol, but McKay
looks to be hit with a zat blast. He lies writhing on the floor then
loses consciousness.]
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[McKay regains consciousness to find himself and Jeanie tied to chairs.
Wallace waits nearby, looking disappointed.]
WALLACE
Why would you do that? Why would...? My daughter is dying!
MCKAY
You kidnapped us. What did you expect?
WALLACE
I shouldn't have given you network access.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, it's a rookie mistake.
JEANIE
(warning)
Meredith.
WALLACE
You're never going to help me. Are you?
MCKAY
You're going to kill us either way. What exactly is our incentive?
WALLACE
I gave you my word!
MCKAY
Which means exactly nothing to me.
WALLACE
(pleading)
Please. My wife died three years ago. I can't go through that again.
Sharon's all I have. You can save her.
MCKAY
Look, this is an experimental medical program. It may never work.
All this might have been for nothing.
WALLACE
Worst case scenario, I thought I would have weeks with Sharon. Now,
if things stay as they are, I'm lucky to have days.
MCKAY
You never should have injected her.
[Wallace's expression changes to one of determination. He goes over to
a table in the room and pulls out a large pneumatic device.]
WALLACE
No, no. It will work. It has to work.
MCKAY
What is that?
[Wallace stands over Jeanie.]
WALLACE
A dose of nanites.
JEANIE
(frightened)
Meredith.
MCKAY
W-w-wait, please! No.
WALLACE
I'm sorry. You need an incentive.
MCKAY
Don't!
[Wallace injects Jeanie with the nanites. McKay is horrified.]
WALLACE
Fix this, or they both die.
[Wallace leaves.]
[Later, they are both untied and working on the computers. Jeanie
breathes heavily and rubs her neck where she was injected. McKay
notices.]
MCKAY
You okay?
JEANIE
Yeah, I'm fine.
MCKAY
Well, you were right. They're not communicating. They're not doing a
lot of things they should be doing, in fact.
JEANIE
Yeah, I know.
MCKAY
See, the thing is, even though DMT manufactured their own nanites?
The-the coding, the programming? Most of it's lifted directly from
the Replicators.
JEANIE
Right.
MCKAY
Well, the thing is? As much as I hate to admit it, we're only just
beginning to understand that coding. The Wraith we've been working
with has helped us make leaps and bounds, but it's--
JEANIE
(surprised)
Wait a second. You've been working with a Wraith?
[McKay goes to stand beside Jeanie and look at her terminal.]
MCKAY
Yeah, it's a long story. What I'm trying to say is, this program
that we're pushing on it is designed to, uh, restrain them, very
specifically, to make sure they don't get out of control. So much
so--
JEANIE
(interrupting)
That they're completely ineffective.
MCKAY
It's like we tied their hands behind their backs.
JEANIE
So we have to cut them loose.
MCKAY
Exactly. These nanites can't replicate. Technically, by unleashing
them, we might make all our little problems go away.
JEANIE
(dryly)
Okay, that shouldn't be too complex. Altering two, maybe three
thousand lines of code.
MCKAY
(dryly)
Yeah, it's a...cinch.
JEANIE
Yeah.
[He walks back to his station.]
MCKAY
Look, I'm-I'm really sorry about all this.
JEANIE
I really don't want to talk about this right now, okay? We need to
write this program and upload it to my nanites. I will yell at you
later. Okay?
MCKAY
(unsettled)
Okay.
[They both get back to typing in silence.]
INT--SPARE SGC CONFERENCE ROOM
[An airman brings more files into a spare conference room. Ronon,
Sheppard, and Barrett pore over boxes of paper files.]
SHEPPARD
We're going in circles here.
RONON
I don't even get what we're doing.
BARRETT
We're trying to match the corporations. See, the company that rented
the space for the internet router was owned by another company which
was owned by another and owned by another.
SHEPPARD
Trying to connect the company that was monitoring Jeanie's computer
to a company that would want to take her.
BARRETT
Probably a company owned by the Trust. We just haven't found a
connection.
SHEPPARD
They knew enough to shut down the transmitter.
BARRETT
Exactly. You know, the fact that they even knew that tells us that
they're pretty intimate with the operations of the Stargate program.
Again, the Trust.
SHEPPARD
We should widen the net. Maybe it wasn't one of them.
BARRETT
Other known enemy groups?
RONON
Or an ally?
BARRETT
Chinese? Russians?
SHEPPARD
McKay said he was working on a program to shut down the Replicators.
Was he working in tandem with anyone here on Earth?
BARRETT
No, no. Not that I know of. Look, wait. There was a medical company
that was working on other nanite programs, but-but they didn't have
any direct dealings with him.
SHEPPARD
And which company was that?
BARRETT
I don't know. But give me a sec, I'll find out.
[Barrett gets up. Ronon also starts to leave.]
SHEPPARD
Where are you going?
RONON
Get some food.
SHEPPARD
In case you forgot, McKay and his sister are still missing.
[Ronon turns back at the door.]
RONON
(sighing)
What? You want my help dissecting corporate structures? When you
find someone to point a gun at? You let me know.
SHEPPARD
Fair enough.
[He waves him off and gets back to the paperwork.]
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[McKay paces nervously.]
MCKAY
What's it been? A couple hours?
JEANIE
Something like that.
MCKAY
So, what? No updates? I mean, I know we're hostages and all, but
c'mon! It took me like ten seconds to upload the program to you.
What's taking them so much time?
JEANIE
It's going to take a while to figure out if our coding patch
actually makes the nanites fight the cancer.
MCKAY
When we activated them in Weir, she was healed almost instantly.
JEANIE
That time the Replicator cells actually replaced her damaged cells.
Our guys have to heal them.
MCKAY
But still, by now they should've seen massive changes in her
condition. I mean, why aren't they telling us anything?
JEANIE
Okay, sit down! You're driving me crazy!
[McKay sits and sulks.]
JEANIE
So, are you going to marry that Katie girl?
MCKAY
What?!
JEANIE
You heard me.
MCKAY
Where did that come from?
JEANIE
I'm trying to take my mind off the fact that I have tiny robots
running through my veins because you needed help with your homework.
Would you rather talk about that?
MCKAY
Not really.
JEANIE
So, are you going to marry her?
MCKAY
I don't know.
JEANIE
You've been dating for over a year now.
MCKAY
I'm aware of that, thank you.
JEANIE
Do you think you're going to find someone better?
MCKAY
No, it's not that.
JEANIE
(grinning)
'Cause you're not.
MCKAY
Hang on.
JEANIE
The fact that you found a nice girl who's willing to put up with all
your many little flaws is a miracle.
MCKAY
Look--
JEANIE
(amused)
Plus, physically...Well, how do I put this? You're no John Sheppard.
MCKAY
(standing, annoyed)
Okay. Let's go back to talking about how this is my fault, 'cause I
think I like that...
[A guard enters.]
MCKAY
...better.
GUARD
Come with me.
[They exit the room.]
INT--MEDICAL WING
[McKay and Jeanie enter the room. Wallace is by his daughter's bedside.
She is sitting up and looking well.]
WALLACE
(smiling and gesturing to McKay and Jeanie)
Oh, come in! Come in! Sharon, I want to introduce you to Rodney
McKay, Jeanie Miller. They're the ones that saved you.
SHARON
It's very nice to meet you. Thank you so much.
[Jeanie and McKay share shocked looks.]
JEANIE
How are you feeling?
SHARON
Better than I've felt in years.
MCKAY
And the cancer?
WALLACE
We can't find any trace of it.
[Sharon smiles in relief.]
INT--SGC COMMISSARY
[Harriman sits at a table across Ronon in the crowded commissary.]
HARRIMAN
And I'm nervous, right? Because, you know, it's an admiral I'm
talking to. So I say to him: "Sir, if you use an I-37 form instead
of an N-1, you can save yourself from using, like, like a hundred
G-72s!" And there's this pause.
[Ronon goes to take a bite of his sandwich, but Harriman stops him.
Ronon drops his sandwich and sits back, looking obviously aggravated.]
HARRIMAN
No one says anything for like, I dunno, it felt like minutes.
Finally the admiral looks over at Landry and he goes: "Hank, not
only is your boy right, but I think we found ourselves a new Bingo
caller for Sunday nights!"
[Harriman laughs at his own joke. Ronon glares.]
HARRIMAN
(unaware)
Bingo! God! I-37! N-1! G-72! Bingo! Who ever said the admiral didn't
have a sense of humor? Oh! Then there was this other time when
General O'Neill...and I...we were--
[Sheppard enters. Ronon immediately stands.]
RONON
Tell me you have something!
SHEPPARD
Devlin Medical Technologies.
RONON
That means?
SHEPPARD
We got somebody to point your gun at.
RONON
Sweet.
[He rushes out. Sheppard steals one of Harriman's fries and then
follows. Harriman is annoyed at losing his audience, then chuckles to
himself.]
INT--WALLACE'S OFFICE
[An elated Wallace pours champagne.]
MCKAY
What are you going to do with us?
WALLACE
Hey! We're celebrating here.
MCKAY
She's still got nanites inside her, and we are both still hostages,
so you'll excuse me if I skip the champagne.
WALLACE
I'm a man of my word. I'm going to let you go.
MCKAY
What, just like that?
WALLACE
(smiling)
Just like that.
JEANIE
But you'll be arrested.
MCKAY
(low, to Jeanie)
Not helping.
[Wallace goes back to pouring champagne.]
WALLACE
I know. I've known I was going to prison from the moment I decided
to kidnap you. I don't care. My daughter's going to live. That's all
that matters. I can't expect you to understand.
MCKAY
You're right, I don't.
WALLACE
We've done a great thing here today, and not just for my daughter.
Hell, we might have just cured cancer altogether. So please, a
toast...to the future.
[They all take glasses. One of the guards enters.]
GUARD
Sir, we have a problem.
[Wallace follows him out. McKay looks worried.]
INT--MEDICAL WING
[Wallace, McKay, and Jeanie enter to find Sharon has coded and medical
staff are performing CPR on her.]
DOCTOR
Clear!
[He shocks Sharon.]
DOCTOR
Nothing. Going again! Clear!
[He shocks her again and checks her vitals.]
DOCTOR
Turn it off.
(to Wallace)
I'm so sorry.
WALLACE
She was fine. I don't understand.
DOCTOR
Her heart just stopped. We couldn't get it pumping again. I'm not
sure what happened.
[Wallace goes over to her bed, brokenhearted.]
MCKAY
(in panicked whisper to Jeanie)
We need to get out of here.
[Jeanie stays staring at Wallace.]
JEANIE
I know.
MCKAY
(low)
I need to get you back to the SGC. Your nanites are running the same
program--
JEANIE
(cutting him off)
I know.
MCKAY
Okay. I'm going to see if I can distract the guard, I need you to
go--
[She heads over to Wallace.]
MCKAY
(panicked whisper)
Jeanie! Jeanie, what are you doing?
JEANIE
(to Wallace)
I'm so sorry... My brother and I need to leave. We need to get to a
bigger lab with more scientists. Please!
WALLACE
I don't know what to do.
JEANIE
I can't imagine what you're going through right now. And I know
you're angry. I would be too. But...if I go untreated...Look, I have
a family. A husband. A daughter. Please! I need to get help, and I
can't do it here.
WALLACE
I'm sorry.
[Sharon gasps and the monitors come back to life. She wakes up, pulling
her hand out of her father's grasp and looking around in confusion.]
WALLACE
Sharon?
(to doctor)
You said she was dead.
DOCTOR
(bewildered)
She was.
INT--COMPUTER ROOM
[Jeanie and McKay are back at work. Wallace waits nearby.]
MCKAY
The nanites are still active.
JEANIE
No. Once they've beaten the cancer, they're supposed to shut
themselves down.
MCKAY
That's never been tested in a live subject, and it's only worked
sporadically in simulations. Look, I told you, this programming is
nowhere near ready to implement.
WALLACE
Wait, you're saying the nanites brought her back to life?
MCKAY
It's the only viable explanation.
WALLACE
Then why did she die in the first place? Shouldn't they have kept
her alive?
JEANIE
That's a good point.
MCKAY
(inspired)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. The doctor said her heart just stopped,
right? Seemingly out of nowhere.
[Jeanie leaps onto McKay's train of thought.]
JEANIE
Does Sharon have any heart problems? Unrelated to the cancer?
WALLACE
Yes, she has a mitral regurgitation problem. Heart murmur.
MCKAY
What, you don't think...?
JEANIE
We broadened the parameters. They weren't just programmed to cure
the cancer.
MCKAY
Once they were done with the leukemia, they moved onto the heart
murmur. And the easiest way to fix that--
WALLACE
Is shut it down while they repaired it.
JEANIE
That doesn't make any sense. Shutting down the heart and starving
the brain of oxygen would cause...severe brain damage.
MCKAY
Damage they could technically fix.
JEANIE
They could repair the tissue, yes. But the patient would lose their
memories, their-their language skills, any sense of self.
MCKAY
They don't care about that. Look, they were designed to fix the body
of all physical maladies. I mean, preserving a sense of self isn't
one of their directives.
WALLACE
So...she's going to be stuck in this vegetative state?
MCKAY
Technically, her brain is perfectly healthy. It's-it's like she's
been...reset to zero, so to speak.
JEANIE
(worried)
Meredith. What about me? I don't have any cancer. They'll look
around and go straight for...
MCKAY
Your epilepsy.
JEANIE
I don't want to be shut down for repairs.
MCKAY
Okay, okay, the first thing we got to do is make sure--
[A blast takes out the door lock. Marines knock down Wallace as
Sheppard and Ronon rush in as well, guns at ready.]
SHEPPARD
You guys okay?
JEANIE
How did you...?
MCKAY
We need to get Jeanie to the SGC immediately. Is the Daedalus still
in orbit?
SHEPPARD
You're welcome. It was a daring rescue.
MCKAY
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. But we're nowhere out of the woods yet. We
have to get to the SGC now!
SHEPPARD
(keying radio)
Daedalus, this is Sheppard. We need a lift.
[As Wallace watches, the team and Jeanie are beamed away.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT
INT--ISOLATION LAB
[Barrett, Sheppard, Ronon and McKay are in the lab.]
MCKAY
Okay, I've put Jeanie in a medically induced coma, and I've broken
her legs.
RONON
You what?
MCKAY
Well, we need to slow down the nanites. Look, this could buy us ten
hours, at least.
SHEPPARD
You...broke her legs? Couldn't you just give her a disease or
something?
MCKAY
She needed an immediate and severe trauma. Besides, if we shut them
down before she's properly healed, all she has is a few broken
bones.
SHEPPARD
Instead of a disease she'd have to fight alone.
MCKAY
Exactly. Now, I'm pretty sure we can't just keep doing this. I mean,
sooner or later, the nanites are going to abandon her broken bones
and move to her brain, so we need to move fast.
BARRETT
Can't we just blast her with an electromagnetic pulse?
MCKAY
No. These nanites were designed specifically to be immune to EM
field fluctuations.
SHEPPARD
Wonderful.
BARRETT
So we have a little over ten hours to come up with a program that
shuts down the nanites.
MCKAY
Right.
SHEPPARD
So what's the plan?
MCKAY
Well, as embarrassing as I find this to say...I need some help.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay and several armed SFs wait at the bottom of the
ramp. The wormhole is active.]
SHEPPARD
This was a bad idea.
MCKAY
Yeah, well it's the only one I got.
[The Wraith Todd arrives with two guards. He is restrained. He staggers
down the ramp, breathing hard and looking around with interest.]
TODD
Why have you brought me here?
INT--LEVEL EIGHTEEN LAB
[Two guards wait outside the lab while McKay, the Wraith, and other
guards stand inside.]
MCKAY
Look, you understand the Replicator coding better than anyone. If
we're going to do this quickly, then...we need your help.
(struck with the sudden reversed position)
And why should you care? I mean, we're going to kill you either way,
right? That's what you're thinking? Okay, okay, um, so...incentives.
Uh, first off, we have no interest in killing you. Of course, you've
probably already figured that out by now. But we can't let you go
either because you know too much about Atlantis, unless you could
prove that you were trustworthy. And...this would go a long way
towards proving that.
TODD
Hmm.
MCKAY
Right. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't buy that either. Heh. Do you
have any relatives? Do the Wraith have brothers or sisters? I-I
don't know how it works. But with us, with...my people? Those bonds
mean a lot. My sister's in trouble, and it's pretty much all my
fault. You could help us. You-you could save her.
[The Wraith yawns.]
MCKAY
Doesn't mean anything to you, does it? I suppose it wouldn't mean
much to me either if I was in your place. Okay, okay, you and I both
know that if we can figure out how to shut down these Earth-made
nanites, it would be a giant step towards shutting down the
Replicators. I know you lost your hive. I have no idea how horrible
that must have been for you.
[The Wraith growls.]
MCKAY
But knowing that they're still out there? That-that you alone could
do something about it? That's gotta be driving you crazy. So don't
do this for me. Don't-don't do this for my sister. Do this for
yourself. Do this because you know you can, and because you know
it'll help destroy the Replicators once and for all. Whaddya say?
[The Wraith grunts and nods.]
MCKAY
Thank you.
'MONTAGE
[The SFs release the Wraith's restraints.]
[McKay and the Wraith talk as the Replicator code scrolls past on a
monitor.]
[Jeanie lies in a coma in the infirmary.]
[McKay and the Wraith each work at computers.]
END MONTAGE
MCKAY
All, right, there's a few bugs to code out, but I think we're close.
TODD
We?
MCKAY
Hey, I have been contributing. Now if I could suggest a few, uh...
[The Wraith stumbles to his knees.]
MCKAY
You okay?
TODD
No.
[The Wraith collapses onto the floor.]
INT--SGC VIP ROOM
[McKay and Sheppard are alone in the spare conference room.]
SHEPPARD
What if he's faking? Maybe he's just milking it for a hot meal?
MCKAY
No, I believe him. He can't finish the coding without feeding. I
understand exactly what he's doing, but he's far more versed in
implementing it than I am. Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but
he's the only one who can do it in a day.
SHEPPARD
I don't know what to say, but the NID is not going to provide us
with a human for him to feed on.
MCKAY
I know. It needs to be me.
SHEPPARD
What?
MCKAY
(scared, but determined)
I want him to feed on me.
[Sheppard steps closer to him.]
SHEPPARD
You want to what?!
MCKAY
Let him feed off of me. Get his strength back, then he can finish
the coding and save Jeanie.
SHEPPARD
Then what? Force him to give you your life back?! He's not going to
do that.
MCKAY
Sharon died. Half an hour ago.
SHEPPARD
(nonplussed)
I don't understand. What happened?! I-I thought the nanites would...
MCKAY
This time, it wasn't a problem with the programming, it was a
manufacturing defect. Look, in layman's terms, the nanites ran out
of steam while they were repairing her arteries. She bled out
internally. There was nothing we could do. I can't lose my sister,
John. How am I going to explain that to her husband? To-to her kid?
SHEPPARD
That Wraith'll kill you.
MCKAY
That's my choice to make.
SHEPPARD
No, it's not. You're an invaluable of my team, and you report
directly to me.
MCKAY
Really? You want to talk about chain-of-command right now?
[Sheppard's eyes are wet with tears.]
SHEPPARD
(intensely)
You are not doing this.
MCKAY
She's here because of me! I can't fix the problem, but I can help
the guy who can. Look, this was not an easy decision to make.
SHEPPARD
I can't.
MCKAY
(begging)
Please.
SHEPPARD
I'm sorry.
INT--SGC HOLDING ROOM
[Wallace and Sheppard sit across a table from each other.]
SHEPPARD
We're going over the data. We don't understand what happened. I'm
sorry.
WALLACE
And Jeanie?
SHEPPARD
She's not going to make it. We brought in a, uh...specialist from
the Pegasus Galaxy. Part of an enemy race called the Wraith.
Somehow, McKay has convinced him to, uh, create a program to shut
down the nanites in Jeanie's body.
WALLACE
And?
SHEPPARD
He was close, real close. But, uh, he hasn't fed in a few weeks, so
he collapsed. He's too weak to finish the coding modifications.
WALLACE
(upset)
I don't understand. If it means saving her life, why not just feed
him?
SHEPPARD
Well, he feeds on...humans. Their life force.
WALLACE
(nodding, thinking)
I see.
SHEPPARD
Little hard to find volunteers.
WALLACE
So Jeanie will...
SHEPPARD
She's gonna die. Just like Sharon.
WALLACE
(with remorse)
I'm so sorry.
SHEPPARD
I'm sure you are.
[He reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out some photographs. He
tosses them down one-by-one on the table. Wallace picks them up.]
SHEPPARD
This is, um, Kaleb, her husband. And, uh, Madison, her little
daughter.
[Wallace weeps.]
WALLACE
I never meant for any of this to happen.
SHEPPARD
I know you didn't. But it did. Now McKay's blaming himself, and I
know better... You know better.
[Wallace takes a deep breath.]
INT--LEVEL EIGHTEEN CORRIDOR
[McKay heads to the door to the isolation lab and runs a key card
through. It rejects it. He tries again with the same result.]
MCKAY
Oh, come on.
[An SF comes over.]
GUARD
Can I help you, sir?
MCKAY
Um, no. No problem.
GUARD
May I see that, sir?
MCKAY
Uh....no you may not.
GUARD
Sir. The card please.
[A resigned McKay hands it over. The guard looks at it.]
GUARD
You're not Doctor Lee, sir.
MCKAY
Oh, is that Lee's card? You know, we were just at the gym and, uh,
must've swapped pants. So, uh, would you just open the door for me?
GUARD
Not without a card, sir.
MCKAY
I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. This is my lab. Would you please open the
door?
GUARD
(shrugging)
I can't do that, sir.
MCKAY
(fiercely)
This is a matter of life and death! Open the door!
GUARD
I'm under--
[The door slides open from the inside. The Wraith is standing and
working. Sheppard is beside him. There are medical personnel and guards
there.]
MCKAY
(surprised)
Sheppard?
SHEPPARD
Let him in.
[The guard lets McKay pass.]
INT--LEVEL EIGHTEEN ISOLATION LAB
[McKay enters and sees the orderlies wheel out a body bag.]
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
I was showing Wallace the labs. The Wraith got the upper hand.
That's what the report's going to say.
MCKAY
You...
[Sheppard watches them wheel out Wallace's body with an inscrutable
expression.]
SHEPPARD
(to McKay)
Come on, you've got work to do.
WRAITH
No, he does not. I've completed the reprogramming.
SHEPPARD
That was quick. Well, get it uploaded.
[McKay looks around in wonder, then joins the Wraith in working.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Jeanie wakes up. McKay sits by her bedside.]
MCKAY
Jeanie?
JEANIE
(confused)
Mer...?
MCKAY
It's okay. It's okay.
JEANIE
Man....medical comas are weird.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, you're not the first to mention it.
JEANIE
Did you...?
MCKAY
Yes.
JEANIE
So I-I'm...
MCKAY
You are absolutely fine. I mean, aside from a few inert nanites in
you.
JEANIE
Thanks, Mer.
[She sits up.]
MCKAY
You can...I'm really sorry about all this.
JEANIE
Oh, I am going to hold this over your head for...forever.
MCKAY
Huh. Totally fair.
[She swings her legs over the bed to stand. McKay assists her.]
JEANIE
Like, you're going to eat a lot of vegetarian food. Heh, heh. And
not complain about it.
MCKAY
Sure, sure.
[He puts her slippers on the floor for her to step into.]
JEANIE
And you're going to read Madison three stories instead of her usual
two.
MCKAY
All right.
JEANIE
You're going to buy me a car.
[McKay reaches for a robe for her then stops short.]
MCKAY
Well, let's not get out of control, here.
JEANIE
You almost got me killed. That's at least a car, a nice one--a
hybrid!
MCKAY
Yeah, well, we'll talk about it on the way home.
JEANIE
Home. That sounds great.
[She reaches forward and hugs him.]
JEANIE
I love you.
MCKAY
Yeah.
[They break apart and Jeanie glares at him expectantly.]
MCKAY
(shrugging)
I love you too.
[She chuckles as he hands her the robe.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS
[Sheppard lounges on his bed reading a comic book as McKay enters.]
SHEPPARD
Hi!
MCKAY
Hey.
SHEPPARD
Look who's back. How was the family?
MCKAY
Uh, it was great. Bought 'em a Prius.
SHEPPARD
Guilt.
MCKAY
Yeah. Listen...I can't believe what you did.
SHEPPARD
I don't really want to talk about it.
[Sheppard keeps reading the comic book to emphasize the point.]
MCKAY
You talked Wallace into sacrificing himself.
SHEPPARD
(carefully)
No, I didn't.
MCKAY
Well, then how did he...
SHEPPARD
I...
[Sheppard closes the comic book.]
SHEPPARD
I presented a situation. He volunteered.
MCKAY
Still, you talked a man into killing himself.
SHEPPARD
He wanted to make things right. I merely, uh...
MCKAY
Presented the situation.
SHEPPARD
Yeah.
MCKAY
Thanks.
[Sheppard nods, his expression vulnerable. McKay stands.]
MCKAY
Want to get something to eat?
[Sheppard studies McKay, then tosses his comic aside.]
SHEPPARD
Sure.
[They walk out of the room.]
MCKAY
Say...you and I are about even when it comes to looks, right?
SHEPPARD
Who's been lying to you?
MCKAY
No, I'm serious.
SHEPPARD
I am, too. Who's been lying to you?
FADE OUT
