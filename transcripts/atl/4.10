TITLE
This Mortal Coil Part 1
TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and Zelenka sit at separate laptop stations.]
MCKAY
Initiating secondary diagnostics...now.
ZELENKA
No variances.
MCKAY
Mmm, Are you sure?
ZELENKA
Positive.
MCKYA
Well, check again.
ZELENKA
Rodney, there's nothing here.
MCKAY
Okay, just get over here and monitor power readings.
[He makes Zelenka switch places with him. Zelenka complies with
long-suffering resignation. McKay studies Zelenka's computer's
readings.]
MCKAY
Huh. No variances.
ZELENKA
(rolling his eyes)
Hmm.
MCKAY
Are you catching any discrepancies on your end?
ZELENKA
Nothing.
MCKAY
Are you sure?
ZELENKA
(irked)
Rodney...
MCKAY
Okay, just...go back-go back-go back, go back, go back.
[He shoos Zelenka with his hand and makes them switch back. Sheppard
enters.]
SHEPPARD
All right, do we know what the problem is?
MCKAY
Yeah, the 'gate's not working.
SHEPPARD
Well, I think we figured that much last week when you broke it.
MCKAY
(annoyed)
I did not break the 'gate.
SHEPPARD
It just happened to stop working around the same time you were
screwing around with it.
MCKAY
I wasn't screwing around with it! I was running a streamlining
program designed to boost its operating efficiency.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, well, good job.
[Zelenka watches the interplay with interest, stifling his expression.]
MCKAY
It had nothing to do with why the gate malfunctioned. Look, we've
been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my
streamlining program. And I feel confident that we're making some
progress, and that things will be up and running in...
[There is a distant thump that reverberates through the room. An alarm
sounds.]
MCKAY
What is that?
TECHNICIAN
An unidentified object has struck the city.
MCKAY
Well, why didn't the sensors pick it up?
TECHNICIAN
I don't know. It came in so fast.
MCKAY
I'm getting a low-level energy signature.
ZELENKA
What could it be?
SHEPPARD
Let's find out.
[McKay grabs a handheld scanner as he follows Zelenka and Sheppard out
of the room.]
INT--READING LIBRARY
[There is a large hole in the ceiling of the room. A security team and
a scientist are already there, the scientist scanning the object that
struck the room as Sheppard, McKay, and Zelenka enter. The object is
about a meter in length and mostly cylindrical.]
SHEPPARD
Any injuries?
GUARD
No, sir.
MCKAY
Thank god it hit the reading library, or someone really could've
gotten hurt.
[McKay and Zelenka take over from the scientist.]
ZELENKA
What is it?
MCKAY
Well, it's obviously some kind of mobile self-contained unit--a
drone, possibly a probe. It's definitely not Wraith design.
ZELENKA
Perhaps it's Lantian. You know, a de-orbited satellite or a device
on a recall directive.
MCKAY
Yeah, maybe. It's still emanating a trace energy field.
SHEPPARD
(leaning back)
Oh, is it dangerous?
MCKAY
No, it's just interesting.
[Sheppard notices a scrape marking the side.]
SHEPPARD
Check that out.
ZELENKA
It was damaged on re-entry, so what?
MCKAY
(dismissively)
Re-entry wouldn't have caused that.
[Zelenka looks from McKay to Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
It looks like weapons' fire. Maybe it took a hit before it came
down.
MCKAY
And yet it came out in one piece.
SHEPPARD
Tough little bastard.
INT--CORRIDOR
[Lorne speaks to a guard, noticing Sheppard leaving. They start walking
together.]
LORNE
Colonel, do we know what it is yet?
SHEPPARD
Looks like a probe of some kind.
LORNE
Any idea who sent it?
SHEPPARD
McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.
LORNE
Well, in the meantime, who's working on the 'gate?
SHEPPARD
The 'gate can wait. This is more important.
LORNE
Well, with all due respect, sir, I think they're equally important.
Wouldn't it make more sense to keep Zelenka working on this mystery
object and move McKay back to his 'gate diagnostics? It's already
been over a week now.
SHEPPARD
(sternly)
Major, not being able to use the 'gate is an inconvenience. The
possibility that someone may have pinpointed our location is a
threat. The threat gets priority.
LORNE
(chastised)
Yes, sir.
[Sheppard walks off. Lorne watches him go.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay munches on a sandwich while studying a computer. Zelenka works
on another computer. Both are hooked up to the object.]
ZELENKA
This is pointless. Even though the object survived reentry
physically intact, its internal systems are shot. These are
just...incomprehensible readings.
MCKAY
(mouth full)
By design.
ZELENKA
(sighing)
There's no design here, Rodney. It's just meaningless data.
MCKAY
(mouth full)
Ah, but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an
advanced masking system--to fool us. They're good; I'm better.
ZELENKA
Who's "they", Rodney?
[McKay swallows, ignoring Zelenka's question.]
MCKAY
Just, um, do me a favor. Relaunch your decrypt sweep.
[Zelenka gives McKay a look.]
MCKAY
Humor me.
ZELENKA
Fine.
[He starts typing. When finished, he looks at McKay.]
ZELENKA
You realize we don't have to stand around here waiting for the
results. It could take hours. Why don't we go back to the 'gate?
[McKay stares at the screen. The gibberish on the screen begins to
organize into set patterns.]
MCKAY
Hang on. It's working. I'm getting something.
[Zelenka starts typing furiously.]
MCKAY
Hey, n-n-no, no no. Don't touch anything.
[Zelenka abruptly stops typing and looks at McKay.]
[McKay watches as the data finally organizes into set patterns and
legible data. An instant later the power shuts down, shorting all the
computers.]
MCKAY
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What happened? What did you do?
ZELENKA
(innocently)
Nothing.
MCKAY
I told you not to touch anything!
ZELENKA
I didn't touch anything. The diagnostic program must've crashed.
MCKAY
We lost all the data!
ZELENKA
What did you see, Rodney?
MCKAY
(looking worried)
Nanite code. It's the Replicators.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--CORRIDOR
[Sheppard walks down a corridor. McKay bursts out of a side door]
MCKAY
It's the Replicators. They found us!
SHEPPARD
Are you sure?
MCKAY
That drone we recovered contained nanites.
ZELENKA
You cannot be certain of that, Rodney. The program went down before
we had a chance to retrieve any significant data.
MCKAY
(insistently)
I know what I saw. It was nanite code a split second before the
system crashed.
ZELENKA
(skeptically)
I saw nothing.
MCKAY
That's because you weren't looking.
ZELENKA
Our laptops were feeding the same data stream. If there had been
anything, I would've seen it.
MCKAY
Well, obviously, you didn't! Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this
dis--
[They hear another distant explosion.]
MCKAY
Another one!
LORNE
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne here.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Go ahead, Major.
LORNE
(over radio)
There's been an explosion in Doctor McKay's lab. I suggest you get
down here.
[The three hurry off.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[They enter McKay's lab. Lorne and a team study the remains. The center
table is destroyed, the central section where the object was is
completely gone. The table is barely together. Charred items are
scattered everywhere.]
MCKAY
Wha...what happened?
[Sheppard picks up a piece of debris.]
SHEPPARD
Well, either your sandwich exploded, or that mystery drone had a
built in self-destruct protocol.
ZELENKA
We must've inadvertently initiated it when we ran our analysis.
LORNE
Sorry, Doc. At least you weren't around when it went off.
MCKAY
(flatly)
Lucky us.
[He stares at Zelenka.]
INT--CORRIDOR
[McKay walks with Sheppard, watching that no one in the crowded hallway
overhears as he speaks.]
MCKAY
Something's not right. That diagnostic program should never have
crashed. It was perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming
from the probe. And then before I get a chance to get it up and
running again, what happens? The probe gets destroyed.
SHEPPARD
What are you talking about?
MCKAY
(sighing)
I don't know. I just--it just feels like someone or something is
working very hard to get in my way. And yes, I know what that sounds
like. Just...do me a favor, keep an eye open, okay?
[Sheppard nods.]
INT--PRACTICE ROOM
[Sheppard and Ronon spar with the short bantu sticks. They come to a
standoff and break apart.]
RONON
You think he's imagining it?
SHEPPARD
Maybe he needs a vacation.
[Ronon attacks again. He strikes a on Sheppard's back before they break
apart. Sheppard grunts in pain.]
SHEPPARD
I guess you disagree, huh?
RONON
Eh, I don't know. It just seems like people are acting different
lately.
SHEPPARD
"Different?"
RONON
I don't know how to explain it. They just, uh...haven't been
themselves.
[Sheppard is first to attack this time. They trade several blows before
breaking apart.]
RONON
Teyla's noticed it too.
SHEPPARD
Well, maybe everyone's getting a little stir-crazy not being able to
get off-world, you know, acting a little...weird, getting a little
paranoid.
RONON
I'm not paranoid!
[He attacks, Sheppard counters, finally kicking Ronon back.]
RONON
People have been acting weird lately.
[He comes at Sheppard again, this time catching Sheppard along the
temple with his stick. Sheppard wobbles, dizzy for a moment. His
forehead over his eyebrow has a long, deep gash.]
SHEPPARD
You make a compelling argument.
RONON
You're gonna need stitches.
[Ronon grabs a towel and hands it to Sheppard.]
RONON
Here... Sorry.
[He smirks in a completely unapologetic way. Sheppard grunts and nods,
holding the towel over the cut.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Sheppard still holds the towel to his forehead, keeping pressure on
the wound as he enters. Keller gets up from her computer.]
KELLER
What happened?
SHEPPARD
Well, Ronon decided to know some sense into me.
[He hops up onto a bed.]
KELLER
Hmm. Let me take a look.
[She grabs some gloves and peers closely at his forehead. There is some
dried blood over his eye, but no open wound. She smiles and shakes her
head.]
KELLER
You're fine.
SHEPPARD
(startled)
No stitches?
KELLER
No. Not even a band-aid. There's nothing there.
[She hands him a small mirror for him to look for himself. Sheppard
peers closely, wiping away any remaining blood.]
SHEPPARD
Well, I'm bleeding.
KELLER
Well, not from any head wound. It was probably Ronon's blood.
[She looks evasive.]
SHEPPARD
No. He hit me. I was bleeding (alarmed)
Run a scan on me.
[He heads over the scanner.]
KELLER
(startled)
A scan?
SHEPPARD
If McKay is right and there were nanites in that probe, there's a
good chance I got infected.
KELLER
(nervous)
Uh, okay. Uh, hold still.
[Sheppard lies unmoving under the scanner as it runs. Keller shifts the
monitor slightly so Sheppard cannot see.]
KELLER
No nanites. You're clean.
[Sheppard sits up, thinking carefully.]
SHEPPARD
Run a blood test.
KELLER
John, if you were infected with nanites, I would--
SHEPPARD
Forget the nanites. Something like this happened to me before. I got
infected with a retrovirus, and I was able to heal right away.
KELLER
I'm sure that's not the case now, since you haven't been exposed--
SHEPPARD
Maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.
KELLER
I seriously doubt--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting sharply)
Just run...a blood test!
KELLER
Okay.
[She goes to the cabinet to get the materials. Sheppard watches her go,
biting his lip.]
INT--EMPTY ROOM
[Lorne and Keller talk in a small empty room off a quiet corridor.\
LORNE
I thought the problem was dealt with. I destroyed the drone.
KELLER
And made them suspicious in the process.
LORNE
So what do you suggest we do?
KELLER
They're still a long way from knowing the truth. For now, we
just...need to be careful.
INT--CORRIDOR
[Sheppard walks down a corridor. Keller hurries to catch up, holding a
folder.]
KELLER
(brightly)
Colonel! I got your test results back. I'm pleased to tell you
you're one hundred percent bug free. No sign of the retrovirus in
your system.
[Sheppard looks at the tablet computer, then hands it back, his
expression sober. They begin walking again.]
KELLER
What's the matter? I thought you'd be happy.
SHEPPARD
All that says is my blood's clean. It doesn't explain the magical
head wound.
KELLER
Well, maybe it doesn't make sense because you're refusing to
consider the only possible explanation for what happened...You made
a mistake.
[Sheppard stops and turns to face her.]
SHEPPARD
Ronon wasn't bleeding. I checked.
KELLER
Well, maybe the blood was already on the towel, and you mistakenly
transferred it to your forehead.
SHEPPARD
(suspicious)
Ronon saw the cut. He was the one who said I needed stitches. Unless
he was wrong too?
[Keller struggles to keep a blank, pleasant demeanor.]
KELLER
All right. Well, I'll run your blood work again, and if I still
can't find anything, we'll do a complete physical.
[Sheppard watches her walk off, unhappy.]
EXT--CITY, NIGHT
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay enters his lab to find all of his teammates already there.]
MCKAY
Hey!
RONON
Hey.
MCKAY
What are you all doing here? What's going on?
[Sheppard holds up a large combat knife blade and looks at McKay in a
casually threatening way.]
MCKAY
Uh...I'll be right back. I just remembered I forgot to unplug
something...or-or plug it in.
[He moves to leave but Ronon pins his arms, holding him in place.
Sheppard reaches out.]
MCKAY
(panicking)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Wh-wh-Wait, hey, what are you doing?
[Sheppard grabs McKay's hand and holds the blade over it.]
SHEPPARD
This may hurt a little.
MCKAY
(terrified)
What are you...No! Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!
[Sheppard draws the knife across McKay's palm. McKay stifles a cry of
pain as his hand begins to bleed. Ronon releases his hold on McKay.]
MCKAY
What is the matter with you?
SHEPPARD
Here.
[Sheppard hands McKay a white cloth. McKay obediently holds it to his
injury.]
MCKAY
Well, I'm going to need more than that. I'm gonna need disinfectant,
or some stitches--
SHEPPARD
(sternly)
Just shut up and hold on a second.
[A frightened McKay looks from Sheppard to Ronon. After another few
seconds...]
SHEPPARD
All right. Let's take a look.
[McKay removes the cloth. His hand has no injury. Ronon rolls his eyes,
unsurprised, as Sheppard and Teyla exchange knowing looks.]
MCKAY
(shocked)
It's gone. That's impossible. How can-how can it...?
RONON
That's the reaction we were hoping for.
TEYLA
If it's any consolation, I can assure you, we all underwent the same
test.
MCKAY
Test? Wh-what test? What the hell is going on here?!
SHEPPARD
(determined)
That's what we'd like to find out.
TEYLA
Rodney, you're not the only one who's noticed the strange behavior
of many of the people on this base. They've been acting...unusually
withdrawn, even secretive.
MCKAY
Yeah...I wasn't sure what to make of it. At first, I was ready to
dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just, uh, gross incompetence. But
then, the more I thought about it, the more I thought it didn't make
sense, even for him. No no. That was no accident. I mean, he crashed
that diagnostic system on purpose.
SHEPPARD
I'm assuming what happened with that drone is no accident either.
MCKAY
But what does any of this have to do with my super-healing
abilities?
SHEPPARD
Last night, Ronon clubbed me in the head.
RONON
(shrugging)
By accident...sort of.
SHEPPARD
I was cut. I went to the infirmary to have Keller check it out. By
the time I got there, it was completely healed.
MCKAY
Oh, but the last time that happened, it was the, er, the
retro-virus.
SHEPPARD
That's what I thought, so I had her run a blood test.
MCKAY
And?
SHEPPARD
(skeptically)
She said she didn't find anything.
MCKAY
(taken aback)
What, you think she's lying?
SHEPPARD
I don't know, but we gotta find out.
MCKAY
Well, I can access the infirmary's database from here. I just...
[He gestures to make sure he can move now. Ronon gestures for him to go
ahead. McKay goes to his computer and starts accessing files.]
MCKAY
Okay, I'm in. Now...and...huh.
RONON
What?
MCKAY
Well, there's no record of any blood test. If she did one, then she
didn't enter the results.
SHEPPARD
She did a full body scan, too.
MCKAY
There's nothing here.
TEYLA
That's impossible. The scanner is wired directly into the computer.
Results are recorded automatically.
MCKAY
Well, that doesn't mean they can't be erased.
SHEPPARD
All right, we need to run our own tests. Till we figure out what's
going on, we can't risk trusting anyone outside this room.
TEYLA
We have to get to the infirmary without anyone knowing.
MCKAY
I have an idea.
INT--STAIRWELL
[Sheppard and Teyla pass personnel in the stairwell. When quasi-alone,
Sheppard keys his headset.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How's it going, Rodney?
MCKAY
(over radio)
I've patched into the life signs detector, but there's a problem.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
What problem?
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay and Ronon sit by a computer.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Just--I'm not sure. Just-just, hold on a minute.
RONON
Looks like it's working fine to me.
MCKAY
(caustically)
Right. Thank you for your input.
INT--CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Teyla pass more people.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Is the infirmary clear?
MCKAY
Hold on.
INT--CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
Rodney!
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
MCKAY
This is bizarre. I mean, I can't get it to give me a live feed. It's
like it's-it's stuck in a loop.
INT--CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
Well, fix it!
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay sighs and types at his computer.]
MCKAY
Hah! All right, I got it.
[McKay's computer image changes. All the life signs disappear except
for four in the central tower, two on one level, two more on a level
below. McKay's jaw drops.]
MCKAY
What the hell...?
RONON
Well, now you broke it.
MCKAY
(protesting)
I didn't break it. It's working fine.
INT--CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Teyla walk through another semi-crowded corridor.]
SHEPPARD
Is the infirmary clear or not?
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
MCKAY
Yeah, the infirmary, the corridors, the surrounding towers...I mean,
according to this, we're the only people on the base.
INT--CORRIDOR
[Sheppard looks at the people passing them.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How is that possible?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Well, offhand, I would say it's not, but right now, I am reading
four life signs.
[Sheppard looks at another person walk by them and exchanges wary looks
with Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
Let's keep moving.
EXT--BALCONY, NIGHT
[Keller stands on a balcony. Lorne and Zelenka approach.]
LORNE
We have a problem.
[Keller stares at Lorne.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Sheppard and Teyla rush in. Teyla heads to the scanner computer as
Sheppard hops on the bed.]
SHEPPARD
All right, let's make this quick.
[Teyla starts the scan.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
MCKAY
I've got something. It's another life sign. It's the outer edge of
the city.
RONON
Let's check it out. Come on.
[He slaps McKay on the shoulder and starts to leave.]
MCKAY
Well...maybe we should...
RONON
(calling back)
Come on...!
[McKay follows Ronon out.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Teyla looks disturbed by what she sees on the computer as the scan
turns off.]
TEYLA
John...?
[Sheppard joins her and stares at the screen.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell?
TEYLA
(in disbelief)
Nanites.
[The screen shows nanites coursing throughout Sheppard's body. They
exchange worried looks.]
INT--CORRIDOR
[Ronon and McKay exit an elevator and follow McKay's handheld scanner.
They reach a narrow hallway, and McKay pauses along one wall.]
MCKAY
There's supposed to be a room here.
[He examines the wall more closely.]
MCKAY
There is a room here.
[He touches something that makes the doors open. ]
RONON
Wait.
[Ronon gestures him back while he goes first, gun at ready.]
INT--HOLDING ROOM
[Lights come on in the room. Weir lies motionless on a bed.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth!
[Ronon and McKay rush to her, pulling her into a seated position. She
awakens.]
RONON
Easy, easy.
[Weir seems as surprised to see them as they are to see her.]
MCKAY
(stunned)
How'd you get here?
WEIR
Uh...I-I don't know.
KELLER
I can answer that.
[They turn to the door. Keller has entered, smiling. With her are armed
guards.]
KELLER
This is where we made her. This is where we made you all.
[They stare at Keller in horror.]
INT--INFIRMARY
TEYLA
(aghast)
This explains why we could heal so rapidly. We get injured, and the
nanites effect repairs.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, we'd better tell the others.
TEYLA
Yeah.
[They turn to go, only to find Lorne and two guards blocking their
path.]
LORNE
That won't be necessary.
SHEPPARD
What the hell's going on?
SHEPPARD
I'm sorry, Colonel. You're goint have to come with us.
SHEPPARD
I don't think so.
[Sheppard's hand starts to move towards his holster. Lorne licks his
lips and takes another step forward.]
LORNE
That won't do you any good.
SHEPPARD
I'm warning you, Major, stand down.
[Lorne takes another step.]
LORNE
Go ahead...shoot.
[Sheppard draws his gun and fires in one swoop. He shoots Lorne in the
leg. The bullet is absorbed, disappearing as nanites reform. Lorne is a
human form Replicator.]
LORNE
You see?
INT--HOLDING ROOM
MCKAY
You're Replicators.
KELLER
(smiling)
That's right. Until you began making changes to our base code, we
were forbidden from assuming the form of any living human. But now
we can take any form we'd like.
[Keller morphs into a black haired female, then morphs back into
Keller.]
MCKAY
You couldn't have replaced everyone on the base--it's impossible!
KELLER
Only because you believe this is the real Atlantis, and that you're
the real Doctor McKay.
[Tehy all turn to McKay, who gasps in shock.]
INT--INFIRMARY
TEYLA
So, you are saying that we are also Replicators?
LORNE
No. You are flesh and blood, ordinary humans in every way, except
that you were manufactured from the inside out by nanites, some of
which remain in your system, effecting repairs as necessary.
SHEPPARD
I'm not buying it.
LORNE
All that you are: your thoughts, your memories, everything was taken
from the real John Sheppard and his team when their minds were
probed over a year ago.
INT--HOLDING ROOM
MCKAY
Ah ha! See, now I know you're lying! Because, uh, a year ago, Carson
Beckett was our chief of medicine, not Doctor Keller. In fact, she
hadn't even arrived yet!
KELLER
This scenario was updated with information obtained from the last
member of your expedition to be captured by the Replicators.
[McKay and Ronon cast sidelong glances at Weir.]
KELLER
(nodding)
Elizabeth Weir.
EXT--REPLICATOR CITY, DAY
INT--REPLICATOR CITY BRIG
[The team and Weir are locked in a cell.]
SHEPPARD
You sure about this?
WEIR
Yeah. I need to see for myself.
[Sheppard unsheathes his knife and hands it to Weir. She draws it
across her palm. McKay averts his eyes. The cut is made, and instantly
heals.]
WEIR
Oh my God.
RONON
All right, we're all infected by nanites.
MCKAY
Not infected with, constructed by.
RONON
I don't believe it.
MCKAY
I know it's tough to swallow, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my
head around it myself, but, uh, it would explain a couple of things.
SHEPPARD
Such as?
MCKAY
Such as why the 'gate's not working, for one? Look, if none of this
is real, this is all just a-a lab rat experiment, then it stands to
reason that the 'gate's not real either.
TEYLA
If this is not the real Atlantis, Rodney, you of all people would've
noticed. The stars alone would have--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
The whole time the 'gate's been down, it has been solid overcast.
That's over a week now. Think about it. When's the last time any of
you saw stars?
[They all exchange disturbed looks.]
INT--REPLICATOR CITY CONFERENCE ROOM
[Two guards escort Weir to the conference room, standing outside as she
enters. Keller waits inside.]
KELLER
(smiling)
Doctor Weir.
WEIR
(cool)
That's what you named me.
KELLER
There's no point in calling you anything else. You're exactly like
her, in every way.
WEIR
Except that I'm not her.
KELLER
No. The real Elizabeth Weir was killed several months ago. Part of
her brain had been replaced by nanites. It was done to save her
life, but...it made her dangerous. Whenever she linked with other
Replicators, the..."human" part of her exerted an..."unhealthy
influence". At least, that's the way Oberoth saw it.
WEIR
(pressing)
But you don't agree?
KELLER
Why do you think we did all this? Your humanity is what we're
interested in. Because the Ancients created us with one fatal flaw.
WEIR
You can't ascend. That's what you're after, isn't it?
INT--REPLICATOR CITY BRIG
[The rest of the team waits in the brig.]
SHEPPARD
All right, I know this is a lot for everyone to deal with, but we're
just going to have to...suck it up and...refocus.
MCKAY
(caustically)
Refocus on what?
RONON
Getting the hell out of here!
MCKAY
So we can go where? Back to Atlantis to resume our lives? Oh yeah, I
forgot. They're not ours.
RONON
Says them.
MCKAY
There's no point in denying the facts. They were telling the truth.
We're not who we thought we were.
SHEPPARD
Well, I may not be the original, but you're going to have a hard
time convincing me that I'm not pretty damn close.
TEYLA
Our origins do not make us any less human. Not physically, and
certainly not mentally. Now while we can think for ourselves. And in
my heart, there is no doubt. We must return to Atlantis.
SHEPPARD
Okay. We go back. Take things from there.
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Great. We're all in agreement. We're getting out of here. Now, all
we have to do is figure out how.
INT--REPLICATOR CITY CONFERENCE ROOM
WEIR
You're part of Niam's group.
KELLER
Most were reprogrammed, but...some of us managed to stay hidden
within the collective.
WEIR
You think by studying us, you'll discover the secret ingredient?
KELLER
You are all fully human. You have the same minds as your original
selves--the same thoughts, the same emotions. More importantly, you
have something that's always eluded us...something that kept your
kind apart from the very beginning and made you special in the eyes
of our creators. You would call it a "soul". It is that secret
ingredient you referred to--the key to Ascension.
WEIR
It is not something you can learn to acquire simply by studying us.
KELLER
Why not? The human brain is just an electro-chemical
machine--biologically created, but a machine nonetheless. Everything
is quantifiable.
WEIR
Oh, now you sound like Oberoth.
KELLER
(sobering)
The others have given up on ascension. They're destroying human
populations throughout the galaxy as a tactic in their war with the
Wraith. They're consumed with hatred and revenge. We believe there's
another path.
WEIR
Why are you telling me all this?
KELLER
(smiling)
You're open-minded, and it's important that we gauge your reactions.
WEIR
Why?
KELLER
So we can avoid the same mistakes next time.
[Weir has a look of shock at the implications.]
INT--REPLICATOR CITY BRIG
[Weir has rejoined the others inside the cell.]
WEIR
They're going to wipe our memories and then start again on another
planet. That probe was sent by Oberoth and the other Replicators.
Our friends out there tried to destroy it, but they only managed to
disable it.
MCKAY
If that thing hadn't crashed into the city, who knows how long this
could've gone on.
WEIR
Yeah, the point is, this position's been compromised. Once the other
Replicators find the city, they'll destroy it.
SHEPPARD
Oh yeah, and us too.
TEYLA
Is that any worse than having our memories erased and starting this
whole process again?
RONON
We've got to find a way out of here.
[Keller arrives.]
KELLER
I'm sorry it's come to this.
WEIR
Listen to me. You probed our minds; you know everything there is to
know about us. So you should know, we will never accept this. No
matter how many times you wipe our memories, we will always figure
it out.
SHEPPARD
She's right. We're genetically predisposed to being...stubborn, and
really pesky.
WEIR
You want to understand what it means to be human, right? You want to
know what qualities might eventually lead to Ascension? You can
start with compassion.
[Keller looks moved.]
KELLER
I understand what you're saying. And under different circumstances,
I might even agree with you. Unfortunately, it's too late.
SHEPPARD
What are you talking about?
KELLER
The other Replicators have found us.
EXT--REPLICATOR CITY PLANET, DAY
[A large Replicator ship flies through the sky, firing below.]
INT--REPLICATOR CITY BRIG
[Everyone can hear the percussions of the blasts.]
KELLER
They failed to break down our mental defenses and bring us back into
the collective, so now they want to destroy us.
MCKAY
Well, you have to raise the shield.
KELLER
We can't. Your creation required too much power, and we couldn't get
our hands on multiple ZPMs without drawing too much attention.
SHEPPARD
Let us out.
WEIR
Your fellow Replicators are targeting human worlds. They are
murdering thousands of innocent people! If you are serious about
following in the footsteps of your creators, you will let us go so
we can stop this!
KELLER
(upset)
Oberoth is too powerful.
WEIR
If this city falls, and we're destroyed with it, this will be
nothing more than a wasted opportunity...a failed experiment! You
know what that feels like.
KELLER
(soberly)
That's what the Ancients considered us...failed experiments.
SHEPPARD
Well, now's your chance to prove them wrong.
WEIR
All we are asking is that you give us a chance to make a difference.
[Keller stares at them, looking uncertain.]
EXT--REPLICATOR CITY SHIP, DAY
[The city contines to be bombarded from above. The Replicator Atlantis
personnel dodge for cover.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Keller leads the team to the control room as explosions range all
around. She hands Sheppard a small tablet-style computer.]
KELLER
Take this.
SHEPPARD
What's this?
KELLER
It's the core drive of a ship's tracking system. With this, you
should be able to pinpoint the locations and movements of every one
of Oberoth's Aurora-class vessels in this galaxy. Take this to
Atlantis. It will be their best chance of stopping Oberoth. Go up to
the bay. Take a jumper!
[They run up the stairs. Weir pauses.]
WEIR
Come with us!
KELLER
I can't. Oberoth might be able to track me. I'll only be a
liability.
[Weir steps towards her. Keller raises her hand.]
KELLER
(firmly)
Go!
[Weir leaves.]
EXT--REPLICATOR CITY SHIP, DAY
[The Ancient city gets bombarded from above by an Aurora-class ship.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Keller stands stoically by.]
EXT--REPLICATOR CITY SHIP, DAY
[The central tower of the city falls. All these events have happened
just like Carter's vision with Davros in "The Seer".]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The team and Weir watch the destruction.]
MCKAY
That's it. The city's gone.
RONON
So now what?
SHEPPARD
Well, we're already cloaked. All we need to do is follow the ship
out into the atmosphere, and...catch a ride before it jumps into
hyperspace.
TEYLA
Catch a ride?
SHEPPARD
Yeah...watch.
EXT--SPACE
[The Aurora-class Replicator ship leaves the ocean-filled planet.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The puddle jumper flies close to surface of the ship.]
SHEPPARD
Okay, redeploying drive pods.
[The HUD appears, showing the drive pods wedging the jumper between two
outcroppings of the ship.]
SHEPPARD
Okay. Nice and snug.
EXT--SPACE
[The vessel enters hyperspace with the puddle jumper on it.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay snores, sound asleep from the passage of time. Ronon kicks
McKay's chair to no effect. Sheppard heads to the rear compartment to
join Weir.]
SHEPPARD
You doing okay?
WEIR
Sure, all things considered. Not bad for a dead woman.
SHEPPARD
Everything will be fine. My guess is we're headed back to the
Replicator homeworld. Once we get there, we can find a ship with a
hyperdrive.
WEIR
And go where?
SHEPPARD
Well, obviously, we can't fly straight back to Atlantis. They'd
probably take us out before we had a chance to explain, but, uh,
maybe New Athos. Or we can contact them once we get there.
WEIR
And then what? How do you think the real Sheppard's going to react
when he sees you? How would you react?
[Sheppard looks disturbed.]
WEIR
Hmm. In a way, I'm lucky. At least I know I'm the only Elizabeth
Weir out there.
EXT--SPACE
[The Replicator Aurora-class ship exits hyperspace over Asuras.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay is awake and studying the HUD and controls. Sheppard and Weir
head to the forward compartment.]
MCKAY
You were right. It's the Replicator home world. Looks like they've
been busy.
WEIR
What do you mean?
MCKAY
Remember those shipyards we destroyed? That's one of them.
TEYLA
They rebuilt it.
MCKAY
And then some.
SHEPPARD
Good. Then we should be able to find a ship they won't miss.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay briefs Sheppard.]
MCKAY
It's a streamlining program designed to boost its operating
efficiency. Look, the 'gate will be offline for what, one hour? Two
hours tops.
[The Stargate activates.]
SHEPPARD
We expecting someone?
CHUCK
No, sir. But, it's Major Jordan reporting in from M34-227.
SHEPPARD
Do you have video?
CHUCK
Yes, sir.
[Sheppard moves to the video screen. Jordan appears onscreen.]
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
What's the situation, Major?
JORDAN
(over video)
Well, sir...there's someone here who would like to have a word with
you.
[Jordan steps out of the way. Weir steps into view. McKay and Sheppard
stare in shock.]
SHEPPARD
(shocked)
Elizabeth.
WEIR
(over video)
Hello, John.
MCKAY
(excited)
Elizabeth! What happened to you? How'd you get away?
WEIR
(over video)
I'm not Elizabeth...well, not the Elizabeth you knew. I have all of
her memories and all of her thoughts. Everything that makes her, me.
But I'm a duplicate. I was created by a faction of the Replicators
as a means to attaining Ascension.
[Sheppard and McKay are in shock at this revelation.]
MCKAY
(stunned)
You look and sound just like her.
WEIR
(over video)
I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true. This group managed to isolate
themselves from the others in order to pursue their study in
secrecy, but they were eventually discovered and destroyed.
SHEPPARD
(nonplussed)
I...don't know what to say. This is all...very, uh...
WEIR
(over video)
Strange?
[Sheppard licks his lips and nods. Weir nods also.]
WEIR
(over video)
Yeah, I know. But we need to meet. We have some information that you
can use against the Replicators.
SHEPPARD
"We?"
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--M34-227 TENT, DAY
[The clone Atlantis team waits. Weir leads Sheppard's team into the
tent. They stare at each other.]
WEIR
Well, I suppose introductions aren't really necessary.
[Weir joins her cloned brethren.]
SHEPPARD
Great. The last time I came face-to-face with myself, I ended up
kicking my own ass.
[Ronon strides over to face down his clone in an intimidation stare
down. McKay walks toward his double.]
CLONE MCKAY
Nice jacket!
MCKAY
Uh, yeah, it's uh...new. We got, uh, new versions of those uniforms.
The, uh, old ones used to, uh...
CLONE MCKAY
Oh...!
CLONE MCKAY AND MCKAY
Bunch up under the arms!
MCKAY
Yeah.
CLONE MCKAY
Huh.
SHEPPARD
(to Weir)
You said you got something for us?
CLONE SHEPPARD
Yeah. McKay!
MCKAY AND CLONE MCKAY
Hmm?
[Clone Sheppard glances over, nonplussed.]
CLONE SHEPPARD
No, my McKay.
[McKay still looks over blankly while his clone gives a start of
realization.]
CLONE MCKAY
Oh! Yeah, right.
[McKay hurries over to grab the Replicator computer. Ronon smiles at
his clone in a manner that's more like a snarl. His clone appears
unimpressed.]
TEYLA
What is that?
CLONE MCKAY
This is the core drive of a Replicator ship tracking system. Once it
is up and running, we'll be able to track every "Aurora class"
Replicator ship in the Pegasus Galaxy.
CLONE SHEPPARD
It's not much, but it's a start.
MCKAY
Are you kidding? This is huge! We've got to get working on a--
MCKAY AND CLONE MCKAY
Modification program!
CLONE MCKAY
Reconfigure the base sequencing...
MCKAY
Run through one of the Ancient relays so the information is...
MCKAY AND CLONE MCKAY
Automatically adapted and outputted!
SHEPPARD
"Outputted?" Is that even a word?
MCKAY
Of course it is!
CLONE MCKAY
We can't both be wrong. Look, we need to get started on this now.
CLONE SHEPPARD
Whoa, whoa! Not so fast! Where do you plan on doing this? We're too
big of a security risk to be allowed back on Atlantis.
SHEPPARD
He's got a...I've got a point. You two are going to have to find
another way to do that.
MCKAY
It's not a problem. I'll just go back to Atlantis, and, uh, get what
we need. We can, uh, do all the work right here.
CLONE MCKAY
(excited)
Oh, this is great! Finally, someone in whom I can have one hundred
percent confidence! I cannot tell you how much I'm looking forward
to working with you.
[Sheppard exchanges disturbed looks with his clone. Teyla looks
disturbed as well.]
MCKAY
And this is just the beginning.
CLONE MCKAY
Humanity's about to benefit from one of the greatest living
scientific minds...times two.
MCKAY
(pleased)
Can you imagine?
CLONE SHEPPARD
I'm trying not to.
[Sheppard rolls his eyes and nods in agreement. The two McKays are
giddy and oblivious as they head off to start work.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, We appreciate all this, but the truth is, we came here for
another reason. You were with the Replicators. What do you know
about our Elizabeth, and are you willing to help us get her back?
[Clone Sheppard exchanges looks with his Weir.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, DAY
[Sheppard walks with the clone Weir through the woods.]
SHEPPARD
You think this other Keller was telling the truth?
WEIR
I don't know why she'd lie.
SHEPPARD
It's kind of weird, that's all. I mean, I don't see you for all this
time, and then five minutes later, I find out...
WEIR
...that I'm dead. Hmm. Yeah. Don't worry, the moment I learned the
truth, I knew there'd be no going back to the way things were. Not
for me, not for any of us.
EXT--ANOTHER PART OF M34-227 FOREST, DAY
[Teyla and Ronon walk through the woods.]
RONON
I don't like it.
TEYLA
I know. It's odd.
RONON
I know I'm me. So who the hell's this other guy?
TEYLA
He is you as well.
RONON
No. There's only one me.
TEYLA
Apparently not.
RONON
He's nothing but a copy then.
TEYLA
From what I understand, even though he's not the original, he's as
much Ronon Dex as you are.
RONON
I don't like it.
[Teyla sighs.]
EXT--FIELD M34-227, DAY
[The clone Teyla and clone Ronon walk through a field near the forest.]
CLONE RONON
I didn't really believe it...not until we got here.
CLONE TEYLA
(despondent)
I know. I was holding out hope as well. I thought that the
Replicators had captured us, implanted the nanites, and that they
were...lying to us to keep us from wanting to return.
CLONE RONON
Yeah, well it worked. I'm not going back with them.
CLONE TEYLA
Ronon...
CLONE RONON
What? I've been on my own before. At least, that's how I remember
it. Now I've got these nanites that'll heal me if I get injured.
CLONE TEYLA
You are not invincible. The nanites can only do so much.
CLONE RONON
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.
CLONE TEYLA
I understand your anger and your disappointment, but it makes no
difference who came first. You are as much Ronon as he is.
CLONE RONON
Oh yeah? Then why does he get my life on Atlantis while I'm treated
like an outsider?
CLONE TEYLA
(uncomfortable)
Our circumstances are different.
CLONE RONON
(sneering)
You mean, we make them feel uncomfortable, so they'd rather not have
us around.
CLONE TEYLA
(bitter)
Given our origins, they see us as a potential threat. Can you blame
them?
CLONE RONON
I guess not. I'd probably do the same Still, that doesn't change
the--
[The pair run into the original Ronon and Teyla. They stare at each
other awkwardly for a few moments.]
CLONE RONON
(loudly)
We'll go back to the camp!
RONON
We'll go find Sheppard and Weir.
[They part ways.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, DAY
[Sheppard and Weir continue to walk together.]
SHEPPARD
Well, it's not like this hasn't happened before. The other Elizabeth
got infected by those little nanite things, and we figured out how
to stop them...somehow. Maybe we can do the same for you.
WEIR
(realizing)
So we wouldn't be a security threat.
SHEPPARD
(awkwardly)
You can contribute. Things'll just be...different.
[Weir sighs.]
WEIR
That's not really the issue, John. I guess what really bothers me is
just knowing that you and the others will always consider me "less"
than what I really am.
[Sheppard grimaces as he looks at her.]
SHEPPARD
That's not true.
WEIR
Of course it is, and I don't blame you.
[Sheppard hears a rumbling sound in the distance.]
SHEPPARD
Do you hear something?
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY
[Teyla and Ronon pause, also hearing the loud, mechanical rumbling
noise.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, SHEPPARD AND WEIR'S POSITION, DAY
TEYLA
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla, please respond.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY
TEYLA
(into radio)
The Replicators. They're here!
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, SHEPPARD AND WEIR'S POSITION, DAY
WEIR
They managed to track the ship.
TEYLA
(over radio)
John do you hear me?!
SHEPPARD
(into radio, sotto voce)
Oh yeah, I heard you.
[Sheppard and Weir spy an Aurora class ship passing slowly by a gap in
the trees.]
WEIR
Our ship must've had a hidden subspace transponder.
SHEPPARD
All right. Run.
[Weir runs ahead of Sheppard. Their path is blasted by drone weapons
hitting and exploding around them.]
INT--TENT
[The two McKays look up from their work as they hear the distant
bombing.]
MCKAY
What was that?
[His clone goes to the tent entrance to look outside.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY
RONON
That way. Come on!
[He runs towards the sounds.]
TEYLA
Ronon, wait!
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S POSITION, DAY
[Weir and Sheppard continue to run between the field and the forest.
Weir is knocked down by the concussion of a blast but Sheppard helps
her up. They meet up with Ronon and Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
Where's McKay?
RONON
He's still at the compound.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, this is Sheppard. I need you to fall back to the 'gate
immediately!
JORDAN
(over radio)
Colonel, this is Major Jordan. The 'gate is a no-go. I repeat, the
'gate is a no-go. There's a Replicator ship in position ready to
take us out the second we show ourselves.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right, everybody fall back to the jumper. Rodney, did you hear
me?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Yeah, I heard you. We're on our way.
[Sheppard begins to move out.]
WEIR
John..? They're guarding the 'gate. They have us trapped. Even
cloaked, if the jumper so much as rustles a bush, they will pinpoint
our position and blast us out of the sky. We need a diversion.
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, DAY
[The two McKays run through the forest. They encounter the clone Teyla
and clone Ronon.]
CLONE TEYLA
What happened?
MCKAY
It's the Replicators. Let's go.
[They all continue to head to the jumper.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, WEIR AND COMPANY'S POSITION, DAY
WEIR
We'll all have a better chance this way.
SHEPPARD
I don't want you doing this, because you feel any less, uh...
WEIR
Human?
[Sheppard looks uncomfortable.]
WEIR
From the beginning, we've been trying to convince ourselves that
we're just like you. Not we've got a chance to prove it.
SHEPPARD
All right. Let's go.
[They head out.]
EXT--M34-227 STARGATE AREA, DAY
[Two Replicator ships hover over the Stargate clearing. A jumper flies
by, and the two ships immediately give chase. As they leave, the
Stargate activates. The jumper tries to cloak, but a blast knocks out
the mechanism. Another blast knocks off their port engine and the
jumper spirals into a crash.]
EXT--M34-227 FOREST, DAY
[A group of Replicators walk through the forest, reaching the crashed
jumper.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[They cautiously enter, seeing the bodies of Weir and Ronon. They go up
to the pilot chair and pull the pilot upright. It is a Sheppard, who's
conscious, the wounds on his face healing via nanites as they stare at
him in puzzlement.]
CLONE SHEPPARD
Yeah, we tricked you. But don't feel so bad. After all, we almost
had ourselves convinced.
[The Replicator fires his weapon at Clone Sheppard.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard's and Jordan's teams run through the wormhole.]
SHEPPARD
(calling out)
Shut it down!
(more quietly)
No one else is coming.
[The others look crestfallen.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Zelenka and McKay work at different computer stations. The Replicator
core is next to McKay's computer. Zelenka rubs his eyes.]
ZELENKA
(sighing)
Shall we take a break?
MCKAY
You go ahead.
ZELENKA
Oh, Rodney, you've been working for five hours straight. You should
take a break.
MCKAY
(focused on his work)
Eh, I will...when I'm finished.
ZELENKA
I know what you're trying to do.
MCKAY
(distracted)
And what's that?
ZELENKA
Lose yourself in your work to avoid thinking about Elizabeth. You
must realize it's only a temporary distraction.
[McKay stiffens and crosses his arms.]
MCKAY
That's one of the perks of the job. If something terrible happens,
you don't have time to dwell on it, 'cause you're too busy trying to
stop the next...terrible thing from happening. Seriously, if it
wasn't for the Replicators, and their...plan to wipe out every human
in the galaxy, I'd be in pretty bad shape right now. No, this is
Carson all over again, and I'm just not ready to deal. Not yet.
[He starts to type on his keyboard again.]
ZELENKA
You're not the only one who misses them, Rodney. I don't suppose you
want to talk about it?
MCKAY
Eventually, but not now.
[Zelenka sighs and stands up.]
ZELENKA
Okay. Oh, shall I get you anything?
MCKAY
No.
[Zelenka starts to leave.]
MCKAY
Radek...
[Zelenka pauses.]
MCKAY
Thank you.
ZELENKA
You're welcome, Rodney.
[He leaves McKay alone.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay continues to work in his lab alone. Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
How's it going?
MCKAY
It's all right.
SHEPPARD
Why don't you call it a night?
MCKAY
No, I uh, I want to finish this. What about you? Isn't it past your
bedtime?
SHEPPARD
I approve the removal of her personal items tomorrow. Have
everything shipped back to Earth. I would have done it sooner, but I
actually thought we were going to...bring her back.
MCKAY
Yeah. Me, too.
SHEPPARD
Let me know when you get this thing working.
[He claps him on the shoulder as he starts to leave.]
MCKAY
Will do. Oh...wait!
[He stares at the computer screen. Sheppard turns back.]
MCKAY
Huh. If this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class
Replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.
[He types a few commands. A map of the galaxy appears on the monitor. A
few red icons appear indicating ships.]
MCKAY
Well, that's not so bad. I guess the Wraith have really taken a
toll.
[Several more ships appear, each dot appearing with a beeping sound.]
MCKAY
(nervously)
On the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.
[Sheppard and McKay stare at the screen with dawning fear as more ships
fill the screen.]
MCKAY
A lot more.
FADE OUT
[More beeps sound.]
MCKAY
Oh, crap.
