Thirty-Eight Minutes
TEASER
EXT--SPACE
[A puddle jumper flies away from a large, ringed planet and toward a
space gate. The right nacelle seems to be leaving a trail of gas
behind.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Markham is piloting, Stackhouse acting as co-pilot. Ford rushes to
stand beside him and look out the view-screen.]
FORD
How we doing?
MARKHAM
Okay, Lieutenant, I think I've got her lined up pretty close.
FORD
No such thing as close. You thread the needle, or we're dead.
MARKHAM
All right.
FORD
It's okay, you can do it. Nice and easy.
(calling to aft cabin)
Okay, I think we're close enough to dial the gate!
MCKAY
Yes, yes! Hurry up and get us back!
[Stackhouse dials the gate.]
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper flies toward the now active gate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard lies against the inclined ramp in the rear compartment. A
cat-sized, insect-like creature is attached to the right side of his
neck. Teyla and McKay are with him, each with a hand on his shoulders.]
SHEPPARD
Get this damn thing off me.
TEYLA
We can't.
SHEPPARD
Cut it off.
MCKAY
(calling forward)
As soon as we establish a connection, radio back that we've got a
medical emergency.
TEYLA
There must be something we can do for him.
MCKAY
There's an emergency first aid kit behind the pilot's seat. Get it.
Major, everything we try to do to remove it just makes the pain
worse. Now try and be still.
[Sheppard nods. Teyla goes to the cockpit.]
TEYLA
Is there no way to go faster?
STACKHOUSE
(tensely)
He's just trying to get us back in one piece.
[Teyla returns to the rear.]
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper's drive pods retract as it approaches the gate, but the
right pod does not retract all the way. It clunks to a stop.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
(into radio)
Atlantis Base, this is Ford. Jumper One is inbound with a medical
emergency. Please respond.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The gate is active. Weir comes out from her office to the control
room, approaching the technician.]
WEIR
What's going on?
TECHNICIAN
The reconnaissance team is reporting a medical emergency. I've
alerted Dr. Beckett. He's on his way.
WEIR
Put on Major Sheppard.
TECHNICIAN
He's the one who's injured.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay works with the med-kit.]
MCKAY
What am I expecting to find in here that's going to get rid of that
thing?
TEYLA
Something for the pain.
MCKAY
I don't think Tylenol's going to do it. He needs a doctor. How much
longer?
FORD
Almost there!
(into radio)
Flight, Jumper One on final approach.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
This is Weir. What's the nature of Major Sheppard's injury?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
(into radio)
Some sort of funky alien bug attached itself to his neck. He's
completely immobile.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
What's it doing to him?
FORD
(over radio)
We don't know, but we can't get it off him, and we tried everything.
WEIR
(into radio)
You understand the risk of bringing something like that back to
Atlantis?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
(over radio)
Yes, ma'am, I do, but we really don't have a choice in the matter.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Understood, Lieutenant. Good luck.
(to Marine standing by)
Quarantine the jumper bay.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Teyla tries to care for Sheppard as the jumper approaches the gate.]
FORD
It's all automatic from here. Here we go!
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper enters the wormhole, but is stopped by the nacelle catching
on the inside of the gate. The ship grinds to a sudden halt.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The rapid deceleration renders Sheppard, McKay, and Teyla immobile on
the deck.]
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper is at a standstill, only the forward part beyond the event
horizon.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The gate is still active. Weir waits for them to come through.]
WEIR
Where are they?
TECHNICIAN
I don't know. The gate's still active. All indications read they
should be through by now.
EXT--SPACE
[The ship is only partially visible in the gate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay and Teyla wake up. They see the event horizon between them and
the cockpit, through the open doorway between.]
MCKAY
Oh, no.
TEYLA
What happened?
MCKAY
The drive pod...the wing things that stick out when we're flying
must've failed to retract. That's the only thing it can be, It's
that, or the stargate shrank, which I highly doubt. This is a--a big
problem.
TEYLA
What can we do?
MCKAY
I don't know if there's anything we can do. I mean, this is a very,
very big problem.
[He notices Ford's arm protruding from the event horizon.]
MCKAY
Give me a hand.
[McKay and Teyla pull Ford out. He is immediately awake.]
FORD
What the hell was that? That's strange.
MCKAY
Yes, it is.
FORD
That is the--
MCKAY
Yes, it is.
FORD
That scraping sound... We're stuck.
MCKAY
Yes, we are. Apparently the engine pod's failed to retract in time.
It's a square peg, round hole.
FORD
Can we pull Markham and Stackhouse out?
MCKAY
Our hands and arms would dematerialize as soon as we cross the event
horizon. It's uh -- there's no way to reach for them.
[They hear the bug creatures noises and turn to Sheppard.]
FORD
The Major?
TEYLA
He must have been knocked unconscious by the impact.
WEIR
(over radio)
Jumper One, this is Weir, what's your status?
FORD
(into radio)
This is Ford. Good to hear your voice. The four of us are still here
but Markham and Stackhouse are inside the event horizon.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Say again?
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
FORD
(into radio)
Ma'am, Jumper One is lodged in the stargate. Teyla, Dr. McKay and
myself are in the rear compartment with the Major. He's in bad
shape. Markham and Stackhouse are in the forward section.
WEIR
(into radio)
How did that happen?
MCKAY
Engine pods...
FORD
(into radio)
We think it was one of the engine pods, but there's no way to be
sure.
MCKAY
It is the only viable possibility.
WEIR
(into radio)
If I understand you correctly, you won't be able to access the
flight controls.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Yes, Elizabeth, it's an extremely intriguing conundrum, and one that
I would love to discuss with you in detail until the stargate shuts
down and this ship is cut in two--
WEIR
(into radio)
Rodney, calm down--
MCKAY
(into radio)
At which point of course--
WEIR
Rodney! If I'm going to be any help to you at all, I need to catch
up. Lieutenant Ford, back it up for me.
FORD
We couldn't I.D the Wraith base of operations from space, like we
did the last time we were there...
FORD
(voiceover)
So we went to the same landing coordinates as before to get a closer
look.
FLASHBACK
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper comes through the stargate and approaches the planet,
cloaking along the way.]
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, DAY
[The team reconnoiters the crater where a Wraith ship had been found
before.]
SHEPPARD
It's gone.
MCKAY
What? I thought you said it was in a mountainside.
TEYLA
It was. We were inside it.
SHEPPARD
Let's move.
[They walk to the edge of the crater. It is empty.]
SHEPPARD
This was the spot.
MCKAY
Well, it's more of a hole than a mountain, really.
TEYLA
Could it have been destroyed?
FORD
This is definitely not a blast crater.
SHEPPARD
No, looks like THEY just picked up and left. So, ship?
FORD
I don't know, sir. That mountainside was covered in trees.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, but the Wraith hibernate for centuries, right? So a lot of
trees could have overgrown in that time.
TEYLA
Then we were held prisoner inside one of the great ships I showed
you in the drawings. They've left to begin culling worlds.
[McKay hears the noises of Wraith drone soldiers off to his right.]
MCKAY
There's movement down there!
[The Wraith start firing on the team.]
SHEPPARD
Go!
[They run from the pursuers.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
She hardly meant begin at the beginning.
FORD
This is Intel she needs to know.
MCKAY
And we have less than thirty-eight minutes.
WEIR
(into radio)
Hold on. Why thirty-eight minutes?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Because that's the maximum amount of time a stargate can remain open
in non-relativistic conditions. It's one of the more immutable laws
of wormhole physics and, oh, my, look at the time. It's now more
like thirty-five minutes. Are we all caught up?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
I get it. What do you need?
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Help.
WEIR
(over radio)
All right. Let me put Kavanagh, Grodin, and Simpson in a room. See
what they come up with.
MCKAY
(over radio)
That's good. And the Czech, the Czech. The Czech whose name I can
never remember.
WEIR
(into radio)
Dr. Zelenka?
MCKAY
(over radio)
That's him. We'll work it at our end.
WEIR
(over radio)
What else?
MCKAY
(into radio)
We'll call you. Thank you.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Beckett enters the control room.]
BECKETT
Where's my patient?
WEIR
There's been a problem. Conference room. Oh, no. Keep a channel open
with them at all times. And turn that damn alarm off!
[They leave the control room.]
EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The bug is pulsing, and there are spots of blood where it attaches to
Sheppard's neck. Sheppard wakes up and sees Teyla looking through the
med-kit beside him.]
SHEPPARD
Hi, Teyla. Are you all right?
TEYLA
I'm fine.
SHEPPARD
Something tells me we haven't made it to Atlantis yet.
TEYLA
No.
[He sees Ford and McKay standing in front of the even horizon.]
SHEPPARD
Ford? What is that?
FORD
We're stuck, sir.
SHEPPARD
We're what?
FORD
In the gate.
SHEPPARD
You mean my day just got worse.
MCKAY
We're going with the assumption it was one or both of the drive
pods. I don't know whether it was mechanical failure or--
FORD
It was damaged as we tried to take off.
FLASHBACK
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, DAY
[Wraith fire on the jumper as Markham and Stackhouse try to take off.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The team is jostled around in the cabin.]
SHEPPARD
We're taking fire. Get some altitude!
MARKHAM
I'm trying, sir!
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
There's no way of knowing really, but, uh, if you know of some way
of manually retracting the mechanism--
SHEPPARD
Cockpit, on the left.
MCKAY
The cockpit is regrettably demolecularized at the moment, but how
about somewhere back here?
SHEPPARD
No.
MCKAY
No. I didn't think so. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be a foot and
a half over there, taking some readings. Feel free to talk amongst
yourselves.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Various scientists and engineers are rushing around the room. Weir
enters.]
WEIR
All right, you've all been briefed. We have less than half an hour.
Where's Dr. Zelenka?
KAVANAGH
He's working up a simulation in Puddle Jumper Two. He went straight
there.
WEIR
That's good.
KAVANAGH
If there was time, it would be.
WEIR
Let's not admit defeat just yet, Doctor. There're six people on that
ship.
BECKETT
I'm just a medical doctor here, so forgive me if this is a stupid
question. If they just stepped through the event horizon, wouldn't
they come through with the front part of the ship when the gate
shuts down?
KAVANAGH
The front half won't re-materialize on this side.
GRODIN
The stargate transmits matter in discrete units. The front half of
the ship cannot re-materialize until the whole ship has crossed into
the event horizon. The stargate is essentially waiting for the
contiguous components--meaning the jumper and everyone inside--to
enter completely before it can transport them.
[Beckett looks to Weir for a translation.]
WEIR
He says the gate only sends things through in one piece.
BECKETT
Right. Sorry.
GRODIN
Unfortunately the outgoing stargate won't transmit the matter stream
until the demolecularization is complete. When it shuts down, the
entire forward section, along with the men inside, will cease to
exist.
WEIR
And what about the others?
GRODIN
The ship will be severed instantaneously along the event horizon.
They'll be exposed to hard vacuum in 29 minutes.
SIMPSON
What if they closed the bulkhead door?
WEIR
The rear portion of the ship would remain pressurized, become a sort
of lifeboat.
GRODIN
It would leak atmosphere like a sieve.
SIMPSON
It could buy enough time to send a second jumper.
KAVANAGH
And do what?
WEIR
Figure it out. Contact Jumper One and make the recommendation.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay works on a laptop connected to the ship. He jumps up and pushes
a button on the panel behind Ford. The bulkhead door closes, leaving
the cabin in darkness as the even horizon is covered.]
FORD
What are you doing?
MCKAY
(turning on a flashlight)
Sorry. Here.
GRODIN
(over radio)
Jumper One, this is Atlantis.
MCKAY
(into radio)
We're still here.
GRODIN
(over radio)
We recommend closing the bulkhead door.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Oh, good thinking. What else?
GRODIN
(over radio)
We're still working on the problem. We'll get back to you. Atlantis
base out.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Thanks for calling!
(to the team)
Anybody else claustrophobic, or is it just me?
FORD
Why'd you close the door?
MCKAY
So that when the stargate shuts down and the forward section is
severed, we're not directly exposed to space.
FORD
Will it hold?
MCKAY
Like a screen door on a submarine. I just prefer apoxia to explosive
decompression. It's a personal thing.
FORD
If the air is going to get thin in here, you really do have to calm
down.
MCKAY
Wait till you see how thin it gets in 27 minutes.
SHEPPARD
McKay--
MCKAY
Vacuum. That's thin.
SHEPPARD
Knock it off.
MCKAY
Oh, I apologize for being the only person who truly comprehends how
screwed we are!
SHEPPARD
Don't talk to me about screwed!
[McKay looks chagrined.]
SHEPPARD
And let's not give up on Markham and Stackhouse, either. There's
plenty of time to solve this thing, but you've got to stop using
your mouth and start using your brain.
MCKAY
I'm sorry, Major. I'm-- I react to certain doom a certain way. It's
a bad habit, and... maybe there's a way to manually retract the
mechanism.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Maybe there is.
TEYLA
(putting her folded up jacket behind his head)
Here. You seem stronger.
SHEPPARD
No, it's just the pain's not so bad now.
FORD
That's good.
SHEPPARD
No, it isn't. I can't feel my legs. Hands and arms are numb. I can
barely move them, and the feeling's creeping up. Lookit,
Lieutenant...what I'm trying to say...is if you don't get this damn
thing off me, I have even less time than you do.
[McKay gets back to work.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER HANGAR
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER TWO
[Zelenka and other techs work on the simulation.]
ZELENKA
Speaks Czech.
[Weir arrives.]
WEIR
Dr. Zelenka?
ZELENKA
Apologies for not attending your briefing, Dr. Weir. There was no
time.
WEIR
I don't want to slow you down, but I need to know what you're
working on so I can communicate it to the team on Jumper One.
ZELENKA
We are attempting to retract the um, uh...the...the drive pod back
into the fuselage, from inside the rear compartment.
WEIR
Anything yet?
ZELENKA
Oh, there's much redundancy in ancient technology making it
dangerous for them to experiment in this way.
WEIR
So they might accidentally open the rear hatch or shut life support
off entirely.
ZELENKA
Yes. Yes, yes. Which is why we are attempting to isolate the correct
control pathway.
WEIR
Understood. What could I do to help?
ZELENKA
Stop talking, please.
ZELENKA
(frustrated)
Speaks Czech.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Teyla and Ford tend to Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
Lieutenant, get your knife out and cut this damn thing off. It can't
hurt as much as it did last time.
TEYLA
The last time, we almost lost you.
SHEPPARD
Well, you're going to lose me anyway.
FORD
Sir...we tried to get it off you when we were back on the planet. We
tried everything.
FLASHBACK
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, DAY
[Ford is with Sheppard on the ground. The bug has already attached.]
FORD
You ready, sir? Here we go.
[Ford shoots the bug with his pistol. Sheppard screams in agony.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
Everything we did just hurt you more. The thing just heals itself.
TEYLA
It feeds on your strength. Like a Wraith.
SHEPPARD
You had to say that.
TEYLA
My father often told stories of creatures such as this. I always
thought he was just trying to keep the children from straying far
from our camp.
SHEPPARD
Great. Did he tell you how to kill it?
FORD
I don't know, sir. I'm not sure we can.
SHEPPARD
Well, I could use a second opinion. Get Beckett on the radio.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Beckett arrives.]
TECHNICIAN
(into radio)
Affirmative. Over here, sir. This mic is open.
BECKETT
(into radio)
This is Dr. Beckett. How's our patient?
FORD
(over radio)
This is Ford. Major Sheppard's conscious, but the creature's still
latched onto him.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How do you feel about house calls, Doc?
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
BECKETT
(over radio)
Would if I could, Major Sheppard, but you'll have to settle for long
distance. I'm told you have something of a cling-on.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
That's funny. It's like the ugliest damn tick you've ever seen.
BECKETT
(into radio)
How did it attach itself?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Well, we were on our way back to the jumper with the Wraith shooting
at us.
FLASHBACK
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, DAY
[The team reaches the top of a ridge and stops to look back at the
pursuing Wraith.]
SHEPPARD
Go tell Markham to get ready for takeoff! I'll cover you.
MCKAY
What about you?
SHEPPARD
I'll be there in a minute! Go!
[The three leave Sheppard to defend their retreat. He exchanges fire
with them, then takes off again. He stops behind a tree and trades fire
again.]
FORD
(over radio)
Major, we're cut off from the jumper!
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Negative. I see one at your 3:00, I drew the other two this way.
FORD
(over radio)
They're all around us. Where'd they come from?
SHEPPARD
Lieutenant, you know how they can make you see things that aren't
there. The path in front of you is clear. Now move!
[Sheppard gets on the move again, backing into a huge spider web with
the bug at its center.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
BECKETT
(into radio)
Can you describe it to me?
FORD
(over radio)
Yes, sir. It's about two feet in length, including the tail. That's
wrapped down under his armpit. It's got two sharp, spiny things in
his neck near the Major's carotid artery.
BECKETT
(into radio)
I'll need more than that, son.
FORD
(into radio)
It's forelegs--I guess you'd call them that--they're wrapped around
the Major's throat. Uh, I can't see any eyes... It's got a real hard
shell, but there's a soft, leechy part underneath.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Major, what are your physical symptoms?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Well, at first, it felt like a knife in the eye. Since then, I've
lost all the feelings in my extremities. I can't move.
BECKETT
(into radio)
So it incapacitates first with pain, then paralysis.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I need to be able to move around to help McKay with the mechanical
problem. Markham and Stackhouse are dead if I don't.
BECKETT
(into radio)
What have you tried?
FORD
(over radio)
I tried to cut it off. I tried burn it off. I even tried to shoot it
off--nine mil point-blank. Not much worse I can do without killing
the Major along with it.
TEYLA
I believe the creature is related in some way to the Wraith.
MCKAY
Really?
BECKETT
(into radio)
How so?
TEYLA
(over radio)
It healed itself after each attempt to remove it, by sapping life
from Major Sheppard, just as a Wraith would.
MCKAY
(over radio)
I suppose the Wraith had to evolve from something. It's probably
some sort of, uh, prehistoric cousin.
FORD
Listen, Doc, the Major's getting worse. We gotta do something right
now.
BECKETT
(into radio)
You said the creature had an underside of exposed soft tissue, like
a leech?
FORD
(into radio)
Yeah, I tried to cut into it. The thing practically strangled him to
death.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Son, you don't cut leeches off. You pour salt on them.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[The scientists are gathered around a table covered with print-outs.]
SIMPSON
If you activate the field, they'll die.
KAVANAGH
Hey, we can always open it again if they fix the problem--
SIMPSON
But they may not have time!
KAVANAGH
If they don't, we could destroy this facility!
SIMPSON
Well, I don't--
WEIR
(entering)
You're supposed to be working on solutions.
KAVANAGH
We think the jumper must be damaged for this to have happened in the
first place. Ancient systems are too advanced for this to have been
pilot error.
WEIR
So?
KAVANAGH
So depending on the extent of the damage, we can't rule out a
catastrophic power feedback in the drive manifold.
WEIR
Without the technobabble, please.
SIMPSON
Dr. Kavanagh was pointing out that there's a very slim chance that
with the cockpit controls interrupted and the pod damaged, the main
drive could overload.
KAVANAGH
She means to say explode. Especially if McKay starts nosing around
inside the control conduits to retract the drive pod manually. And
he will. I know I would.
WEIR
And Zelenka is working on simulations. I just came from there.
KAVANAGH
If there is a catastrophic overload, the full force of the explosion
will break up the jumper, follow the burning fragments through the
stargate like a bomb.
WEIR
(to Simpson)
You think the risk of this happening is minimal?
SIMPSON
In my opinion? Yes.
WEIR
(to the others)
You all agree? Then we take the chance.
KAVANAGH
I thought it was important to point out the risk.
WEIR
Fine. You did. Now, please, worry a little bit more about their
lives and less about your own ass. Twenty-three minutes.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir rushes back toward the control room. Halling and other Athosians
approach her from the bottom of the stairs. He is carrying a tray with
several vessels on it.]
HALLING
Dr. Weir?
WEIR
I'm sorry. I don't have time right now.
HALLING
Neither do those people who are trapped aboard the ship of the
Ancestors.
WEIR
News travels fast.
HALLING
I was speaking with one of your expedition members when she was
called in to help.
WEIR
Well, then you are aware that we are very short on time.
HALLING
I am. Still...this is important.
WEIR
Okay.
HALLING
You do not know this, but among our people, there is a ritual prayer
that is said when one knows that death is upon them.
WEIR
We don't know that it is.
HALLING
I am told it is all but inevitable.
WEIR
By whom?
HALLING
That is not important. What is important is that Teyla be allowed to
prepare for death. Knowing the time and place of one's end is a...is
a very rare thing among our people.
HALLING
It is a simple rite that would not take more than a few moments--
WEIR
Halling. We need to concentrate all of our efforts on saving them.
HALLING
At the risk of forsaking Teyla's own beliefs?
WEIR
It is important that we use what little time we have to try
everything--
HALLING
I would ask you not tell me what is important and what is not in
this case.
WEIR
I'm sorry. I can't have this conversation right now.
HALLING
Why not?
WEIR
Because we are wasting time.
HALLING
This is time that Teyla could use to prepare.
WEIR
All right. You perceive death a certain way. I accept that. In fact,
I respect that. But we do not prepare for death. We do everything we
can to stave it off. That is who we are.
HALLING
I'm not asking you to suspend your efforts--
WEIR
No you want me to tell everyone on that ship that they should expect
to die. I will not send them that message. And if you feel that that
violates Teyla's personal rights, I apologize, I truly do but
there's nothing I can do about that right now. I have to go.
[She leaves a very disappointed Halling behind.]
EXT--SPACE
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
BECKETT
(over radio)
All right we've got everything from the jumper manifest already laid
out here. What's your personal inventory?
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
FORD
(over radio)
Okay, from the vests, we've got a Swiss Army knife, some chocolate,
some water, matches, emergency kit. We have alcohol, iodine,
painkillers...
[As Ford speaks, Carson and his assistants lay out the same items on a
table.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
What's this?
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis
infirmary.]
FORD
Teyla found a portable defibrillator in the ship stores.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Already thought of that. Major Sheppard would receive the same
electric shock. It would likely kill him.
FORD
(into radio)
Right.
BECKETT
(over radio)
Try everything, one item at a time.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Kavanagh enters and approaches Weir.]
KAVANAGH
Dr. Weir.
WEIR
Kavanagh. I hope you've got something to tell me.
KAVANAGH
Yes, I do. What the hell was that?
WEIR
Excuse me?
KAVANAGH
I happily left the SGC because I had had it up to here with the
military running things, and you just busted me like a private.
WEIR
Don't be so dramatic. Besides, the Air Force doesn't have privates--
KAVANAGH
Neither do I. You just cut them off, right in front of my research
team.
WEIR
That's what this is about? You're embarrassed?
KAVANAGH
Well, humiliated would be a little more accurate.
[Others walking by stop at the sound of their voices.]
WEIR
I haven't worked up to humiliation yet.
KAVANAGH
I just assumed that with a civilian in charge of the expedition,
there would be a little bit more--
WEIR
A civilian is in charge, and we are cut off from Earth, which makes
Atlantis almost like a colony, doesn't it?
KAVANAGH
I suppose.
WEIR
Well, I'm Governor of that colony.
KAVANAGH
No, that's all very well and good--
WEIR
Do you have a problem with that?
KAVANAGH
You're missing my point.
WEIR
No, you're missing mine.
WEIR
If you waste one more minute which could be used to help the people
trapped on that ship because of your ego...I promise you, I will
dial the coordinates of a very lonely planet where you can be as
self-important as you want to be.
[He makes a scoffing noise.]
WEIR
You think I'm kidding?
KAVANAGH
You wouldn't do that.
WEIR
Kavanagh, get back in there!
KAVANAGH
We'll talk about this later.
WEIR
Never again! Go. Go!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER TWO
ZELENKA
Ow.
(his computer beeps)
He speaks Czech.
(into radio)
Dr. Zelenka to control room... I think I have something.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
GRODIN
We're receiving.
WEIR
(into radio)
Jumper One, this is Weir. Dr. Zelenka's come up with something.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Zelenka. Why can I never remember that name?
GRODIN
(over radio)
He's positively identified the control systems in the port side of
the jumper that retract the drive pod. I'm relaying the schematics
to your data-pad.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Thank you. Now we're getting somewhere.
GRODIN
What?
MCKAY
Zelenka's identified the control pathways to the engine pod, which
means that's increasing my chances of fixing this from one in a
million to one in a thousand but, uh... it's something. Elizabeth?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Yes?
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
I'll only have seven to nine seconds to warn you if I accidentally
trigger a catastrophic overload, so if I tell you to raise the
shields...don't hesitate.
WEIR
(into radio)
We're aware of the risk, Rodney. Do your best.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Ford speaks to Beckett over the radio as he tries different substances
on the bug. Beckett listens from the infirmary.]
FORD
We're starting with iodine.
[Nothing happens.]
FORD
Scratch iodine.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
BECKETT
(into radio)
What else have you got there?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Yes, what have you got there? Any food?
FORD
You're kidding.
MCKAY
I have less than twenty minutes to save our lives, and I am
teetering on the brink of a hypoglycemic reaction, so...
[Ford tosses him a power bar, which he opens.]
MCKAY
Thank you.
[He starts eating it as he keeps working.]
TEYLA
(handing Ford a bottle)
Here.
FORD
(into radio)
We're going to try alcohol now.
BECKETT
(over radio)
Place a few drops on the soft tissue to see how it reacts.
SHEPPARD
Save some for me.
FORD
Wrong type of alcohol, sir.
SHEPPARD
What's the good of that?
FORD
Not much, sir. No reaction to alcohol.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
BECKETT
(into radio)
Right. What next?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
Did the doctor not say to pour salt on the creature?
MCKAY
I think that was a metaphor. But it doesn't matter. Just try
everything.
[Ford pours salt on the creature. It doesn't react. Beckett and Weir
listen with great anticipation from their respective locations.]
FORD
Water. Give me water.
[He pours water on top of where he dropped the salt. After a moment,
the creature balloons up and sinks its legs and pincers deeper into
Sheppard's throat. Sheppard begins to yell out in shock and pain.
Beckett and Weir listen to his screams in alarm, as do the
researchers.]
FORD
Sir. Sir, are you all right? Sir? Major?
[Sheppard screams louder.]
FORD
(over radio)
Sir, are you all right? Sir! Major? Major? What's happening?
[Sheppard shoves Ford away with great strength, sending him crashing
into the wall of the ship. The surprise makes Rodney touch something on
the control crystals, and a drive sound is heard.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
What's happening?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard is trembling in pain. Ford gets up from the deck.]
FORD
It reacted to either the salt or the water.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
BECKETT
(into radio)
Or a combination of both. Did it loosen its hold on Major Sheppard?
FORD
(over radio)
Negative.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
(into radio)
If anything, it dug in more.
SHEPPARD
(roughly)
Please don't do that again.
FORD
I won't, sir. I'm sorry.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
BECKETT
(into radio)
Most likely a primitive defensive reflex to salt water.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
We moved. When you fell, I must've crossed one of the circuits. I
think the engine fired for a microsecond, but it stopped. Oh, no.
[He sees that the ship is now far enough into the wormhole that the
even horizon is partially visible through a hole in the floor.]
FORD
What? What?
MCKAY
So much for plan "A".
FORD
What?
MCKAY
When the stargate closes now, every molecule of air in this
compartment is going to rush out through there.
TEYLA
We slid in further.
MCKAY
(sitting down, defeated)
Fifteen minutes.
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Ford what can you tell me?
FORD
(over radio)
The puddle jumper has shifted slightly. The rear compartment has now
breached the event horizon. Dr. McKay. Dr. McKay...is still hopeful
he can retract the drive pod in time.
[McKay stands and gives Ford a stern look, looks back at Sheppard, then
continues his work.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Understood. We haven't come up with anything yet, but there's still
time.
FORD
(over radio)
Yes, ma'am.
WEIR
(into radio)
How is Major Sheppard?
SHEPPARD
(into radio, grimacing in pain)
I'm still here.
WEIR
(over radio)
Hang in there, Major. We're working on the problem.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I know you are. Listen, uh...I'd like to say something while I still
can.
WEIR
(into radio)
Don't! You're going to get through this.
SHEPPARD
(into radio, smiling ruefully)
If I was...he wouldn't have let me go.
WEIR
(into radio)
Who wouldn't have let you go?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
The Wraith.
FLASHBACK
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, DAY
[Sheppard kneels on the ground, pulling at the creature newly attached
to his neck, as the Wraith soldier approaches. The Wraith stares at him
and the creature, then turns and walks away.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I guess he just saw me as good as dead, 'cause he just walked away.
So...what I wanted to say was--
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Save your strength, John, and tell me in person.
[The conversation switches between the jumper, the Atlantis control
room, and the infirmary.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
This is important.
WEIR
(into radio)
I'm listening.
FORD
(into radio, interrupting Sheppard)
We should send him through the event horizon. If Dr. McKay figures
it out in time we can fix the Major up on the other side. If he
doesn't, we're all dead anyway.
MCKAY
No pressure.
GRODIN
(over radio)
Major Sheppard would effectively be in suspended animation for the
entire time.
BECKETT
(into radio)
We can't risk that.
FORD
(into radio)
Why not?
BECKETT
(over radio)
If the creature reacted that violently to a few drops of water, who
knows how it would react to stargate travel?
WEIR
(into radio)
You're telling me Major Sheppard can't come through the gate while
that thing is on him?
TEYLA
(into radio)
Then we must do something now.
[Beckett and Weir pause, trying to think of something.]
SHEPPARD
Hit me with the defibrillator.
BECKETT
(into radio, excited)
You may be on to something, Major!
FORD
(into radio)
You said that might kill him.
SHEPPARD
That's the idea.
TEYLA
I don't understand.
BECKETT
(over radio)
Teyla...you said this creature is like a Wraith.
TEYLA
(into radio)
Yes.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Then how do you think it would respond if, God forbid, Major
Sheppard were to die right now, then?
TEYLA
(into radio, realizing)
It would stop feeding.
BECKETT
(over radio)
Exactly, just as a Wraith would.
WEIR
(into radio)
How is that an idea?
BECKETT
(over radio)
We're suggesting that we fool the creature into thinking its prey is
dead by stopping the Major's heart. If I'm right, it should let him
go.
FORD
(into radio)
When the thing lets go, we give him another jolt?
BECKETT
(over radio)
You can give that a try. If it doesn't work, send him through the
event horizon. He'll keep there as good as a deep freeze.
WEIR
(into radio)
John, are you sure you want to do this?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I want this damn thing off me.
BECKETT
(to his techs)
Be prepared for a code blue in the jumper bay.
(into radio)
Lieutenant Ford, do you know how to do this?
FORD
(into radio)
Yes, sir.
[Ford gets out the defibrillator.]
FORD
(to Teyla)
Cut his shirt open.
TEYLA
What?
FORD
Cut his shirt open!
[Teyla takes scissors from the med-kit and cuts Sheppard's tee-shirt up
the middle, exposing his dog tags.]
FORD
(working the defibrillator)
Charging to two hundred. Move his tags.
TEYLA
What?
FORD
Remove his chains to the side.
[She does so.]
BECKETT
(into radio)
Place the lubrication right on the paddles.
[Ford does so.]
FORD
(into radio)
Ready to go. Once the bug falls off, I'm going to have to kill it.
I'll wait for it to charge up again, and I'll give him another jolt.
McKay...
FORD
if we can't restart his heart on the first try I'm going to need the
bulkhead door open again.
MCKAY
Done.
[McKay opens the bulkhead door.]
FORD
One of us is going to have to get him through.
TEYLA
I will.
[Ford places the paddles on Sheppard's chest but hesitates.]
SHEPPARD
Do it!
[He shocks Sheppard, who convulses then settles back, unmoving. Ford
puts his fingers to Sheppard's neck.]
FORD
No pulse!
[Teyla tries to pull on the creature but it won't release.]
TEYLA
(into radio)
It won't come off.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Settle. It may take a moment.
WEIR
(into radio)
Lieutenant?
[Teyla tries again, and the creature detaches. She tosses it onto the
bench. Ford shoots it several times with his pistol, and it lies still,
leaking thick fluid. Teyla wraps it in her jacket as Ford prepares the
paddles again. Ford shocks Sheppard. He checks for a pulse at his neck
again.]
TEYLA
Nothing?
FORD
Nothing! Let's get him through!
[Teyla and Ford lift Sheppard by the arms and maneuver him near the
event horizon. McKay helps Ford put Sheppard into Teyla's arms.]
FORD
Got him?
TEYLA
Yes.
[Teyla carries him backward into the wormhole.]
FORD
(into radio)
This is Lieutenant Ford. The creature's successfully been removed
from Major Sheppard, but we were unable to revive him. Both he and
Teyla are now on the other side of the event horizon.
WEIR
(into radio)
Thank you, Lieutenant. Rodney, you have seven minutes.
EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Beckett and a medical team arrive, rolling a gurney and dressed in
hazmat suits.]
EXT--SPACE
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay works on the crystal controls as Ford looks on.]
MCKAY
I'm only halfway through all the possible circuit pathways and
time's almost up. We're never going to make it.
FORD
Just keep at it. There's still time.
MCKAY
You should consider stepping into the event horizon. I'm serious.
I'll keep trying till the end, but given your choices, that's a far
better way to go.
FORD
And leave you here alone with that thing wrapped up in my jacket?
MCKAY
You did check to make sure it was dead, right?
FORD
It's dead.
MCKAY
Good, because explosive decompression and death by suffocation with
that thing on my face is possibly the--
FORD
Work!
MCKAY
Sorry.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[The researchers continue working.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Time?
GRODIN
Two minutes, twenty seconds.
WEIR
(into radio)
Rodney, we're down to two minutes.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
I know the time. I've still got over two dozen circuits I haven't
tried.
[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control
room.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Don't be so methodical. Just pick one at random.
MCKAY
(into radio)
If I do that, I run the risk of attempting to activate the same
circuit twice.
WEIR
(into radio)
Just try!
MCKAY
(over radio)
I'm telling you there's no way I can---
[A circuit combination happens, and there is the sound of a mechanism
activating.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Wait!
[They listen for more sounds.]
EXT--SPACE
[The pods retract, but the ship remains unmoving.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
I think I did it.
[Beckett, the researchers, and Weir all wait in anticipation in their
locations.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth, I think the engine pod's retracting.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and others rush to the balcony to watch the ship come through.
Halling and the Athosians wait on the stairs.]
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper sits still, even though there is now nothing
interfering with it.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Then why haven't you shown up?
EXT--SPACE
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
She's right. Why aren't we moving?
MCKAY
(realizing)
It's inertia. The drive shut down before we went through the
stargate. We've shed all our forward momentum.
[Ford starts jumping against the forward bulkhead, as if to push the
ship through.]
MCKAY
You're wasting your time. For every action, there's an equal and
opposite reaction.
FORD
(angry)
Then what are we going to do?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[They listen in frustration.]
GRODIN
One minute.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
KAVANAGH
(over radio)
Wait! The rear hatch. Blow the rear hatch! It should give you enough
thrust to make it through.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
That could do it, but the only mechanism to blow the hatch is back
here.
[He indicates a switch near the rear of the jumper.]
FORD
You go through. I'll do it.
[Ford opens the bulkhead door again.]
MCKAY
No, no, you'll get blown out into space.
FORD
No, no, there's no time to argue, just go!
MCKAY
Make sure you hold on to someth--
FORD
Just go!
[Ford shoves McKay into the wormhole.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
GRODIN
Thirty seconds.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The creature stirs inside the jacket. Ford braces himself then pulls
the lever to open the rear hatch. All of the air gets sucked out of the
ship rearward, including the creature. He hangs on as his body is blown
horizontal.]
EXT--SPACE
[The ship moves forward slowly.]
EXT--WORMHOLE EFFECT
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The jumper comes thorough the gate, which shuts down. The personnel
clap and cheer. The Athosians stand. smiling. Weir and Halling exchange
confirming looks.]
WEIR
(to Grodin)
I'll be in the jumper bay.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard is lying on the deck of the jumper. Beckett is using a
defibrillator on him.]
BECKETT
Again!
[In the aft compartment, Ford has been placed on a gurney and given
oxygen. Weir arrives.]
MCKAY
He's going to be fine.
[Weir clasps Ford's hand, then he gets wheeled out, and Weir and Rodney
move forward to Sheppard. Beckett continues to work on him, but his
heart is still flatlining on the monitor. Weir and Teyla exchange nods.
Beckett shocks Sheppard again.]
WEIR
Well done, Rodney.
MCKAY
(tense)
We'll see.
[The medics work on Sheppard, including using an air bag.]
BECKETT
We've got a pulse.
[Markham and Stackhouse join everyone in sighing in relief.]
BECKETT
Getting stronger.
[Beckett takes off his stethoscope and listens to Sheppard's chest by
ear.]
BECKETT
He's going to be okay.
[Weir sits down on the bench suddenly. Rodney paces around the rear
compartment and exchanges glances with Beckett. Sheppard appears to be
sleeping peacefully.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard is awake and smiling at a nurse who has finished changing his
bandages. He is dressed in red scrubs. The rest of his team and Weir
are there, dressed in civilian clothing.]
WEIR
How are you feeling?
SHEPPARD
Starving.
MCKAY
He's got quite the hickey, but Dr. Beckett says he'll be fine in a
few days.
TEYLA
We should let you rest.
SHEPPARD
No, you should get me food.
WEIR
I think we can arrange that.
FORD
(tapping Sheppard on the shoulder)
Welcome back, sir.
[Teyla, Beckett, and Ford start to leave.]
SHEPPARD
I have to admit, it is a pleasant surprise.
WEIR
By the way, what were you going to say?
[The other three stop to listen.]
SHEPPARD
When?
WEIR
Before, when you thought, you know...
SHEPPARD
Oh, that...
WEIR
I didn't want you to say it at the time, but now I'm curious.
SHEPPARD
I was going to say, um... Take care of each other.
WEIR
That's nice.
SHEPPARD
Yep.
MCKAY
And, uh indeed, we did.
SHEPPARD
Yes, you did. Thank you. Again.
MCKAY
You're welcome.
TEYLA
Good night.
[They all leave but Weir.]
WEIR
You weren't really going to say that, were you?
SHEPPARD
I have no idea what you're talking about.
WEIR
I didn't think so.
[She leaves. Sheppard gets comfortable on the bed and closes his eyes,
smiling.]
FADE OUT
