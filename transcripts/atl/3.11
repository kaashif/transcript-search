TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Woolsey cowers in a corner of a darkened corridor. He hears a noise,
gets up, and cautiously approaches, holding a pistol.]
WOOLSEY
(whispering)
General?
[He looks around the corner.]
WOOLSEY
General!?
O'NEILL
And if I'm a Replicator?
[Woolsey jumps back, startled, then looks chastened.]
WOOLSEY
Then I've just exposed my position.
O'NEILL
Again.
WOOLSEY
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.
[O'Neill and Woolsey move back to where Woolsey had been before.
O'Neill pulls out a power bar from his pocket and hands it to Woolsey.]
O'NEILL
Here.
WOOLSEY
Thank God! I'm starving!
[He starts eating the bar ravenously, then peers at O'Neill.]
WOOLSEY
Was this all you could find?
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
No. Actually there was a lovely buffet.
WOOLSEY
How did the recon go?
O'NEILL
Well, the Stargate Ops is crawlin with `em. There's no way we're
gonna get across to the Jumper Bay.
WOOLSEY
Are they looking for us?
O'NEILL
I plum forgot to ask.
[O'Neill and Woolsey sit on the floor, against the corridor wall.]
WOOLSEY
Well, as long as the life signs detectors aren't working in these
damaged areas, we should be able to hold out until they rescue us.
O'NEILL
Uh, Richard, there's not going to be a rescue.
WOOLSEY
What?
O'NEILL
Landry has standing orders to nuke the city if there's any sign of a
foothold situation.
WOOLSEY
What kind of a standing order is that?
O'NEILL
Mine.
INT--ATLANTIS STARGATE OPERATIONS
[The Stargate activates.]
TALUS
What's happening? Activate the shield.
[Cetus works some controls.]
CETUS
I can't.
EXT--ATHOSIAN PLANET, NIGHT
[The puddle jumper hovers in front of the active Stargate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
That's confirmation. The Gate shield is lowered.
SHEPPARD
I hope this little plan of ours works.
MCKAY
Yeah, you and me both.
EXT--ATHOSIAN PLANET, NIGHT
[The puddle jumper flies through the active wormhole.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The puddle jumper flies into the Gate room via the wormhole. Its
shields are active. Replicators immediately begin to fire on the ship
from various positions.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Authentication code Alpha Six Delta Charlie Niner. General O'Neill,
Woolsey, do you copy?
[The scene switches between Sheppard's and O'Neill's locations as they
communicate by radio.]
O'NEILL
Sheppard? Is that you?
SHEPPARD
Yes, sir. I need to know if you're anywhere near Stargate
Operations.
O'NEILL
No, we're not.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
That's good. Can't talk right now, sir. Get back to you in a couple
of hours. Sheppard, out.
(to McKay)
Drop the package.
[McKay presses some buttons.]
MCKAY
Package is away.
SHEPPARD
Hold on.
[The puddle jumper goes into reverse. The event horizon has already
shut down, so the vessel flies back through the inactive Stargate and
through the glass behind it.]
TALUS
Follow me.
[Two replicators approach a black box sitting under where the puddle
jumper was. It emits a beeping sound that becomes more rapid.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[As the puddle jumper flies away, the tower housing Stargate Operations
explodes into a fireball.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Everyone looks on in amazement, and Ronon smiles.]
SHEPPARD
That went well.
[Weir winces and shrugs.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The puddle jumper flies away from Atlantis.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
WOOLSEY
That sounded like an explosion.
O'NEILL
Because it was.
WOOLSEY
Is Sheppard attacking the city?
O'NEILL
He'd better be.
WOOLSEY
Why can't he get back to us for two hours?
O'NEILL
I don't know.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Harriman sits at his station. Landry paces behind him.]
HARRIMAN
It's coming up on 2300 hours, sir.
LANDRY
I can see that, Chief.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
LANDRY
I have to assume Sheppard heard my message and chose to ignore it.
HARRIMAN
There's no way to be a hundred percent certain, sir, but...
LANDRY
He heard me alright. They're already in Pegasus doing goodness knows
what. Which leaves me no choice but to lock out their IDCs and
invalidate their personal authentication codes.
HARRIMAN
But, sir, if they're successful in rescuing--
LANDRY
We have no way of knowing whether they've been successful or if
they've been compromised. I have my standing orders, and I'm damned
well going to follow them. Now, when you're done locking out those
IDCs, have Doctor Lee report to my office.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
EXT--ATLANTIS PLANET
[The puddle jumper flies in space around the planet.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
It's good to be back, however briefly.
BECKETT
I feel like I'm gonna be ill.
RONON
Don't be.
WEIR
All right, just take some deep breaths, Carson.
[Beckett sighs and nods.]
TEYLA
Should we not have informed General O'Neill of our plan?
SHEPPARD
He knows we're here. We'll contact him again as soon as we get
closer to the city.
MCKAY
Well, that is gonna be easier said than done. With all those hits we
took, it's gonna be impossible for me to convert the shield back to
a cloak.
SHEPPARD
And by "impossible", you mean ...
MCKAY
I mean "not possible". What do you think I mean?
SHEPPARD
Well, hopefully we took out the sensors when we blew the tower.
WEIR
Well, you said they could rebuild remarkably fast. How long before
they restore critical systems?
MCKAY
(shrugging)
Who knows? A couple of hours?
SHEPPARD
There's the painting and redecorating.
MCKAY
(inspired)
If we time this right, this could work to our advantage.
[A panel beeps and the HUD appears in front of them, displaying
something in space nearby.]
SHEPPARD
Got him! Right where we left him!
[McKay checks his laptop computer.]
MCKAY
That's him.
RONON
Who else would it be?
MCKAY
True. His power levels are barely registering. It's no wonder the
Replicators didn't find him.
SHEPPARD
All right, I'll swing around and pick him up. Watch yourselves, I'm
closing the bulkhead.
[The bulkhead door closes behind Teyla and Ronon.]
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper approaches Niam floating in space. The cargo door
opens.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
Will we not be vulnerable to the same nanovirus with which Niam
infected Elizabeth?
[Teyla, Ronon, and Weir exchange nervous looks. Beckett still looks
ill.]
BECKETT
He's been floating in space for over a month now. He's resting in
such a harsh environment, direct solar radiation has severely
diminished his power levels. We're fairly certain he's almost
completely incapacitated.
RONON
Is he dead?
MCKAY
He's mostly dead. Besides, we don't have a choice. He's the key to
our whole plan.
WEIR
(nervously)
All right. But if he even twitches...
RONON
Don't worry.
[Ronon brandishes his weapon. Weir smiles.]
WEIR
Thank you!
SHEPPARD
Got him. Closing the rear hatch.
(to Beckett)
Take the seat.
[Sheppard joins Teyla and Ronon. Beckett replaces him in the pilot's
chair.]
BECKETT
The compartment's re-pressurized.
[McKay turns, a handheld computer at ready. The bulkhead door opens and
Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon all point the anti-replicator weapons at
Niam. Niam lies sprawled on his back, looking frozen. They turn back to
McKay, who winces and gets up to join them.]
MCKAY
Okay, okay.
[McKay and Sheppard move closer to Niam. McKay starts scanning Niam.]
MCKAY
Okay. Okay, this is good. His power levels are minimal but not too
minimal. I'm fairly sure he doesn't have the juice to regain
consciousness.
[Two of Niam's fingers move.]
MCKAY
Wh-whoa!
[McKay stumbles back as Ronon and Sheppard stand at ready. Niam's
fingers settle back. His chest rises and falls as if breathing.]
MCKAY
I was fairly sure.
SHEPPARD
Just...load the program.
[McKay more cautiously approaches with the handheld device.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS WORK STATION
TALUS
Repairs are under way in Stargate Operations, but we have lost all
main sensors.
CETUS
We are trying to route all the telemetry through these terminals but
they were not designed to take on so many systems.
TALUS
We have stationed several observers around the city. If the gateship
returns, we will detect it visually.
CETUS
They communicated briefly with someone within the city. We'll send
search parties here and here.
[He indicates places on a glass schematic of the city.]
TALUS
All of the Ancients were killed. Their commander attempted to
conceal that fact as I probed her mind.
CETUS
There may have also been a small number of humans.
TALUS
We would have detected them.
CETUS
They may be hiding where the sensors are inoperable. If we want to
capture the ones who attacked us, we must first capture those they
came for.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard is crouched near McKay.]
SHEPPARD
Well? Done yet?
MCKAY
I think we're good to go.
SHEPPARD
All right. I'll take us back.
[Sheppard gets up and moves to the pilot chair.]
WEIR
Why don't we do this from here?
MCKAY
Do what from here?
WEIR
Render the Replicators helpless, Rodney? Remember the plan?
MCKAY
Of course I remember the plan. It's my plan.
SHEPPARD
Uh, actually, using Niam was Elizabeth's plan.
WEIR
Thank you!
MCKAY
It was mostly my plan.
(muttering petulantly)
It was my freezing program.
BECKETT
You said they'd be frozen in place six or seven hours. Why not do it
now?
MCKAY
Because I've gotta keep Niam at nominal power levels, otherwise we
risk him waking up. Look, low power means short range. Short range
means we need to get closer.
TEYLA
How much closer?
MCKAY
Much.
RONON
With no cloak?
MCKAY
No cloak.
SHEPPARD
Good to be back home, huh?
WEIR
Hmph. There's no place like it.
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Landry is seated behind his desk. Lee enters and sits in one of the
chairs.]
LEE
I realize I was duped, General, but they were incredible. It was
like a scene out of The Sting.
LANDRY
Calm down, Bill. That's not why I brought you in here.
LEE
(continuing)
In my defense, this was obviously something they had planned for a
long time--
LANDRY
Forget about it. I'd like to know your opinion on the best way to
disable the Gate Bridge between galaxies.
LEE
(blankly)
We just finished building that.
LANDRY
I'm aware of that.
LEE
Okay. Uh, well, umm, I-I suppose if one were to detonate a Mark Nine
at the midway station, that'd pretty much do it.
LANDRY
I thought so. I'd like you to supervise the preparation of a Mark
Nine to keep our options open.
[Lee slumps back in his chair.]
LEE
Ah. You know, you could always dismantle it. Of course, it would
take a bit more time.
LANDRY
Which we may not have.
[Landry stands, but Lee remains slumped in the chair.]
LEE
(shocked)
Wow. Th-that is such a shame.
[Lee stays seated in the chair, lost in thought.]
LANDRY
Doctor, why are you still in my office?
LEE
(abashed)
Uh, right.
[Lee quickly exits.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The puddle jumper flies towards the city.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
All right, we're about a mile out.
MCKAY
Okay, I'll start broadcasting the virus now, but, uh, we're gonna
need to get closer than that.
EXT--ATLANTIS
[A replicator standing guard on a balcony spots the ship. In another
part of the city, a hatch opens, and five drones fly out, heading
towards the puddle jumper.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
Drones!
SHEPPARD
McKay!
MCKAY
We're still not close enough.
SHEPPARD
Hang on!
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[Sheppard flies the puddle jumper through the city in an evasive
pattern, dodging the four drones chasing them as they maneuver past the
various buildings. Sheppard is able to have some detonate against other
buildings, but some are still on their tail.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Woolsey and O'Neill can hear the drones exploding.]
WOOLSEY
That sounded like another explosion.
O'NEILL
Yes. Yes, it did.
WOOLSEY
What does that mean?
O'NEILL
Something exploded.
WOOLSEY
But is it Sheppard attacking the Replicators, or the Replicators
attacking Sheppard?
O'NEILL
We'll find out!
WOOLSEY
How did they even get here? Through the Gate?
O'NEILL
I've been sitting next to you through the whole thing. Why do you
think I have more information?
[Woolsey drops his pistol and shrugs off his loosened tie in
frustration.]
WOOLSEY
Look, I told you I wasn't good at this.
O'NEILL
He said he'd be back in a couple of hours. That gives him a good...
(checking watch)
...eleven seconds.
[Another explosion happens, rocking the corridor.]
WOOLSEY
What was that?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
If we keep this up, there won't be much of a city left to save.
SHEPPARD
(annoyed)
I'll try to run the drones into your least favorite buildings.
McKay!
MCKAY
It should be working.
BECKETT
Well, it's not working!
MCKAY
Well, if I give him any more power, he'll wake up and kill us all!
RONON
(bitingly, to McKay)
Sheppard can't keep this up forever.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[One of the drones strikes the puddle jumper on its starboard side,
though shields cushion the impact.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
Shields have been damaged.
SHEPPARD
Alright, I've had enough. I've got a different idea.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The puddle jumper engines retracts and it dives into the ocean. The
drones do not follow.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
WOOLSEY
They're overdue.
O'NEILL
Not yet.
WOOLSEY
It's been well over eleven seconds.
O'NEILL
Yes. But you've been ignoring the dramatic element of...suspense.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
General O'Neill, are you there, sir?
O'NEILL
See?
WOOLSEY
Oh, thank God!
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Yes, we're here. You're late.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Sorry, sir. Had to go into space and pick up some...frozen goods.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Woolsey exchange looks.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
Whatever. Where are you now?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
We're not exactly inside the city yet. We're headed toward an
underwater Jumper Bay.
EXT--OCEAN, NIGHT
[The jumper moves through the water.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
Well, what we think may be an underwater Jumper Bay.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
Is that Doctor Weir I hear?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
Yes, General. It's good to hear your voice too.
O'NEILL
(over radio)
I didn't say it was good, Elizabeth. Please, don't be offended as I
express my "surprise" that Landry would send you on a mission like
this.
WEIR
Well, sir, General Landry didn't sanction this mission.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
So, am I to assume you are not surrounded by heavily-armed SG teams
and young strapping marines?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
You've got Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Teyla, McKay, myself, and Doctor
Beckett.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
(sarcastically)
Woo! Doctor Beckett, is it? Well, I'm comforted.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
BECKETT
What's that supposed to mean?
[Weir shakes her head.]
MCKAY
Okay, ready to open the lock.
SHEPPARD
We've got a plan, sir, a...good one.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
Yes, Colonel, I'm sure you do. But in the unlikely event you don't
fail miserably, you're fired.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Yes, sir. Look...forward to that.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
O'NEILL
They have a plan.
WOOLSEY
(without confidence)
I heard.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Through the window, it can be seen that Sheppard is maneuvering the
jumper into an underwater bay.]
BECKETT
(quietly)
Careful.
SHEPPARD
Thanks, Doc!
MCKAY
Okay, closing the outer door. Yes. Now, I just have to pressurize
the compartment and we are...
[The computer beeps. McKay looks surprised.]
MCKAY
Huh?
SHEPPARD
What?
MCKAY
It's not letting me do it.
BECKETT
The water's not draining out.
MCKAY
Yeah, excellent observation, thank you.
[Weir steps to the rear of the puddle jumper.]
WEIR
It is, however, draining in.
[McKay looks over in dread.]
MCKAY
Oh, not again.
[Sheppard gets up to look at the leaks. Beckett immediately mans the
pilot chair.]
SHEPPARD
Well, guess we took some damage.
MCKAY
(panicking)
I just want to point out that this was not my idea.
SHEPPARD
You said, "Get us close to the city." This is pretty damned close!
MCKAY
And yet, no cigar!
SHEPPARD
All right. Just open up the outer doors. I'll figure something else
out.
MCKAY
Right.
[More beeps from the computer.]
MCKAY
Oh...dear.
WEIR
What?
MCKAY
I don't think I'm gonna be able to open the outer door.
WEIR
Why not?
MCKAY
I think it might be jammed.
SHEPPARD
"Might?"
MCKAY
Okay, "is".
SHEPPARD
(irritated)
Well, that's unfortunate.
MCKAY
Yeah, I'd have to agree with you on that.
SHEPPARD
This part of the plan isn't going so well.
INT--JUMPER BAY
[The bay is still filled with water.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
There must be a manual override somewhere.
MCKAY
In the bay's control room, yes.
SHEPPARD
Okay, I'll swim to it.
[Sheppard reaches up to check something on the ceiling.]
MCKAY
...which is sealed from the other side.
SHEPPARD
Of course it is!
TEYLA
Perhaps General O'Neill can reach it.
MCKAY
Good. Okay, give me half an hour to get Niam to the right power
level, so we can do this.
SHEPPARD
We've got more than one fracture. We don't have that kind of time.
(into radio)
General O'Neill? We're gonna need a favor.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
[Woolsey and O'Neill head towards a hatch with ladder access to the
next level.]
[The conversation switches between McKay in the jumper and the others
in the corridor.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Okay, there should be a hatch leading down to the next level. Do you
see it?
O'NEILL
Yep. Sure do. We see it.
MCKAY
The Control Room should be almost directly below.
[Woolsey and O'Neill look down into the hatch and exchange looks.]
O'NEILL
Okay, slight problem here.
MCKAY
What's that?
O'NEILL
Well, the level below is completely flooded, too.
MCKAY
Ah. I, uh, couldn't convince you to take a swim today, could I?
[O'Neill sighs. He hands his P-90 over to Woolsey and takes off his
outer fatigue shirt and boots.]
O'NEILL
All right. If you hear something, don't call out to it. Shoot it.
WOOLSEY
Understood.
O'NEILL
Anything that's not me is a Replicator, so don't hesitate.
WOOLSEY
(nervously)
You won't be gone long, will you?
O'NEILL
Uh, kinda depends on the temperature of the water. Let's see.
[He dips a toe into the water and yanks it out quickly.]
O'NEILL
Not long.
O'NEILL
(into radio)
McKay? What do I do once I get down there?
MCKAY
It's a manual override. It should be in the center of the console.
It'll be obvious once you get in there.
O'NEILL
(into radio)
All right.
WOOLSEY
Good luck.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
[O'Neill sets the radio down on the railing and starts climbing down
the ladder. He takes several deep breaths.]
O'NEILL
All right, here we go.
INT--FLOODED CONTROL CHAMBER
[O'Neill dives under and starts swimming towards the control room. It
is the second room after the hatch. O'Neill can see the jumpers in the
bay. He swims around a station in the center of the control room. There
is a panel on each of four sides, and all are filled with buttons,
knobs, and levers. O'Neill looks nonplussed, then heads back to get
more air. He surfaces with a gasp to find Woolsey waiting.]
WOOLSEY
Did you do it?
O'NEILL
(gasping)
Radio.
[Woolsey reaches for the radio and hands it to O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
(into radio)
McKay.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Did you do it?
O'NEILL
(angry)
You and I have very different ideas of what "obvious" is.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Well, I've never seen it before!
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
O'NEILL
There are dozens of controls down there I wouldn't even know how to
describe!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Well, it's an emergency control. It should be among the most
prominent.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
O'NEILL
God.
INT--FLOODED CONTROL CHAMBER
[O'Neill dives again and enters the control chamber. He finds a lever
and tries it. It controls the door he used. It closes. Panicked he
keeps pulling the lever, then the one next to it. The door opens
slightly. He goes to the other side and finds another lever. He pulls
that and water starts to drain out of the jumper bay. He turns to
leave, but the lever snaps back up, stopping the procedure. O'Neill has
been underwater too long. He goes to the door and has to physically pry
it open enough to get out.]
[On the surface, Woolsey keeps checking his watch. O'Neill surfaces.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
WOOLSEY
God, you can hold your breath a long time! You almost gave me a
heart attack!
O'NEILL
(coughing)
Me too.
MCKAY
(over radio)
General. It sounded like you had the right control. Why did you
stop?
O'NEILL
(into radio)
It's a dead man's switch. I have to hold it in place.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
(into radio)
I had no idea.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
O'NEILL
(sarcastically, into radio)
Really?
O'NEILL
Oh, God.
INT--FLOODED CONTROL CHAMBER
[He dives again and heads directly to the lever, holding it down.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The team sees the water level lowering.]
MCKAY
He's doing it! He's almost got it!
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
[Woolsey hears footsteps approaching.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Tell him, like, thirty more seconds and we're ...
[Woolsey quickly shuts off the radio so no one can hear. He turns to
the corridor, holding his rifle.]
WOOLSEY
I can do this.
[Under water, O'Neill sits still with his eyes closed, holding the
control.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard and Ronon are passing out weapons.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Woolsey? Woolsey, come in.
SHEPPARD
Something's wrong.
(he lowers the cargo hold door)
McKay, you stay here and reprogram Niam. We're gonna go meet General
O'Neill and Woolsey, all right? We'll wait for your okay.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ONE LEVEL ABOVE JUMPER BAY
[O'Neill breaks the surface again, looking triumphant.]
O'NEILL
Woo! Yeah!
[He looks up to see weapons pointed at him by two replicators. More are
holding Woolsey captive.]
REPLICATOR
Don't...move!
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[Woolsey and O'Neill are marched into the brig, the Replicators holding
them by painful grips to the shoulders. When in the room, they are
released.]
O'NEILL
(wincing)
Ow!
TALUS
Where are the others?
[Woolsey and O'Neill exchange looks.]
O'NEILL
What...others?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and the others find several discharged cartridges from where
Woolsey must have tried to hold back the replicators before capture.]
TEYLA
They have been captured?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, it looks like.
WEIR
Which means their minds will be probed for information any minute
now.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
McKay, fire up that virus.
MCKAY
I am working as fast as I can.
SHEPPARD
The Replicators have O'Neill and Woolsey.
MCKAY
Unfortunately, that information can't make me work any faster.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard groans.]
SHEPPARD
This way.
[The team heads out.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
CETUS
What were you doing in the flooded sections of the city?
O'NEILL
The backstroke, I think.
TALUS
What are you planning?
O'NEILL
Well, I was planning to retire, but, man, is that overrated. I mean,
it's not like I'm a workaholic or anything, but, you know, I like to
stay active...with the community. It's-it's a health maintenance
sort of thing, you know?
[The replicators hold Woolsey and O'Neill as Talus and Cetus approach.]
O'NEILL
I don't like where this is going.
WOOLSEY
What are they doing?
[Talus and Cetus place their hands into O'Neill's and Woolsey's heads.]
INT--O'NEILL'S SUBCONSCIOUS
[O'Neill and Talus stand on the ramp of the Gate room, an active
wormhole beside them.]
O'NEILL
Whatcha doin'?
TALUS
Probing your mind.
O'NEILL
Kinda roomy, ain't it?
TALUS
Your ability to resist is quite remarkable, General O'Neill.
O'NEILL
(smiling)
It's not the first time I've had a hand in my head, as it were.
TALUS
If you do not give me what I am looking for, I am sure Richard
Woolsey will.
O'NEILL
I'll tell you what, you look around, and I'll tell you if you're
gettin' warmer or colder, alright?
[Talus's expression changes to one of satisfaction.]
TALUS
Ah. There it is.
O'NEILL
(unhappily)
So...hot, I guess.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[They release Woolsey and O'Neill, who cry out in pain.]
WOOLSEY
That was the worst thing I've ever experienced.
[O'Neill puts a hand on Woolsey's shoulder.]
O'NEILL
Yeah. It gets worse.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
MCKAY
Okay, if I...that should... Yeah. Okay, yes. Stand by.
(into radio)
I've got his power levels about as high as I'm comfortable with. I'm
gonna try to get him to ...
[McKay suddenly senses something and turns around. Niam stands behind
him, fully conscious.]
NIAM
You've been warned about tampering with our base code, Doctor. You
won't get a second chance.
[McKay fumbles for the ARG and is able to reach it and fire before Niam
can touch him.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
McKay? Come in, McKay.
MCKAY
(panicked)
Fall back to the Jumper! We're gonna need a new plan.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The rest of the team have joined McKay in the jumper. Sheppard studies
the broken replicator blocks from where Niam disintegrated.]
WEIR
He just came to life?
RONON
They must have got to O'Neill and Woolsey.
SHEPPARD
O'Neill would've never given us away.
TEYLA
Obviously their minds were probed.
SHEPPARD
Well, they know we're here and how we got in.
MCKAY
Which is how they were able to reactivate Niam, which pretty much
screws Plan A.
BECKETT
Could you activate the freezing program another way?
MCKAY
No. I need to load the program directly into a Replicator and spread
it that way.
WEIR
All right, so that plan's out the window. We need another one.
RONON
Well, these weapons blow them apart, right? I say we just start
killing `em.
MCKAY
Well, normally I would share your run-and-gun enthusiasm, but these
weapons are only gonna work for so long before they manage to
identify the frequency they use to disrupt the bonds that hold the
Replicators together.
RONON
What'd he say?
SHEPPARD
They build up an immunity.
MCKAY
Exactly. Look, the freezing plan would have worked because they
would be unable to communicate with each other while we were
blasting them, but the more we shoot, the greater the likelihood
these weapons are gonna become ineffective.
WEIR
Okay, so what are our options?
RONON
I just gave you one.
SHEPPARD
We'll call that...Plan B.
WEIR
Anyone for a Plan C?
MCKAY
(snapping his fingers)
C-4. How much do we have?
SHEPPARD
A bunch. Why?
MCKAY
Well, it's desperate...
WEIR
Well, so are we.
MCKAY
We need to split into groups.
SHEPPARD
I was gonna suggest that anyway. Why? What are you thinking?
INT--ATLANTIS WORKSTATION
CETUS
We far outnumber them. If we conduct a search...
TALUS
We will be able to locate them more effectively once repairs are
complete.
CETUS
The damage was severe. We had to dismantle our ship to provide the
raw materials.
TALUS
Once repaired, Atlantis will be all the ship we need.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[Woolsey and O'Neill sleep. McKay and Sheppard enter the room, destroy
the Replicator guard, and approach the cell.]
O'NEILL
Well, it's about time!
WOOLSEY
Oh, thank God!
SHEPPARD
Alright, get 'em out of here. I'll stand guard.
[Sheppard stands by the entrance to the room. McKay uses his handheld
computer and tries to work on the door controls. O'Neill appears very
irritated, Woolsey relieved.]
O'NEILL
Hey! "Thanks for the rescue!"
MCKAY
Oh, hey! No problem.
O'NEILL
No! You should be saying: "thanks for the rescue"!
[He points to himself.]
MCKAY
(contrite)
Oh! Uh, right. Thanks. Should have you outta there in no time. This
won't take long at all.
(His face falls.)
Oh, my. They've changed the codes.
WOOLSEY
But you can crack it, right? You need to get us out of here.
MCKAY
Yeah, of course I can. Just give me like one...two seconds.
O'NEILL
So I guess that frozen Replicator plan didn't pan out?
MCKAY
Yeah, not-not so much.
O'NEILL
(still irritated)
How's that Plan B working for ya? Good?
MCKAY
Actually, it's more like Plan C. "C" as in C-4, if you catch my
drift.
O'NEILL
No.
MCKAY
Let's just say that we're concerned the Daedalus won't be able to
carry out your standing orders.
WOOLSEY
What?!? To destroy Atlantis with nuclear weapons? I thought we were
past that! Why are we going back to that?
MCKAY
Yeah, it's the only way.
O'NEILL
Can you do that?
MCKAY
Yeah. If we plant charges in all ten of the shield emitters before
the Daedalus arrives, that way when the Replicators try to activate
the shield...
WOOLSEY
The C-4 detonates, the Daedalus beams a warhead into the city, and
we all get vaporized.
O'NEILL
Sounds more like a Plan F, doesn't it? As in: "we are totally f--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
If we can fight our way back to the bay, then we'll be able to fly
the jumper to a safe distance. That is, if we can get the underwater
bay door open.
O'NEILL
You can't even open this door!
MCKAY
(defensively)
Hey, I'm workin' in it!
O'NEILL
Yes. I see that.
SHEPPARD
We got company.
(to O'Neill)
Sorry, sir, we're gonna have to come back for you.
MCKAY
No-no-no-no-no-no, we can't leave them here. They know too much.
SHEPPARD
What'd you tell `em?
MCKAY
Uh, uh, I mean, they guessed most of it.
[Sheppard smacks McKay in the back of the head.]
SHEPPARD
What, and you filled in the rest?!
MCKAY
I thought I would have time to get them out of here!
(to O'Neill)
Look, just forget what I said.
[O'Neill has been watching this exchange shrewdly.]
O'NEILL
Sheppard, get out of here while you still can. That's an order.
SHEPPARD
Sorry it has to be this way.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I get it. Go.
WOOLSEY
(resigned)
So, we're back to being vaporized.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate is active. Landry enters the room and stands by
Harriman's station.]
LANDRY
What is it, Chief?
HARRIMAN
We're receiving a subspace data burst via midway in the Alpha Site.
Daedalus is holding station at their failsafe point and awaiting
your order.
LANDRY
Reply to Colonel Caldwell that General O'Neill's order stands.
Atlantis is to be destroyed at all costs.
HARRIMAN
Yes, sir.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
INT--ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
BECKETT
Done ... and done.
TEYLA
Good. We are well ahead of schedule.
BECKETT
Perfect. Now let's find some place out of the way and wait for this
thing to be over.
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
RONON
Come on. One more to go.
WEIR
Almost done. We haven't run into a single Replicator.
RONON
I know. It's weird.
WEIR
Woolsey and O'Neill said that there are hundreds of them. Where are
they?
RONON
Let's go.
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
MCKAY
Okay, that should do it.
SHEPPARD
One more to go...
MCKAY
...And it's all over but the crying.
SHEPPARD
Hopefully them, not us.
[There is a sharp noise and then a humming.]
MCKAY
What the hell?
[He starts looking at the readout screens.]
MCKAY
No wonder they weren't coming after us. They've been busy repairing
the city.
SHEPPARD
What is that?
MCKAY
They brought their ZPMs to power the stardrive.
SHEPPARD
So that sound is..?
MCKAY
The city about to take off.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
[The city starts to rise.]
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
MCKAY
Time to start crying.
SHEPPARD
They'll still have to activate the shield to take off, won't they?
We got most of their emitters.
MCKAY
Yeah, "most" ain't gonna cut it. For this plan to work, it is all or
nothing.
SHEPPARD
What do they want to fly around for?
MCKAY
Well, maybe they wanna fly home, back to their homeworld.
SHEPPARD
And take on the Daedalus. Well, how are we gonna stop 'em?
MCKAY
Well, I...
SHEPPARD
Drones. They fired drones at us. That means the Chair is active and
powered.
MCKAY
You wanna fire drones at the city? We're nowhere near the Chair!
SHEPPARD
But Teyla and Beckett are.
[He reaches for his radio.]
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
[The scene switches between Teyla/Beckett and SHeppard/McKay.]
BECKETT
(into radio)
You want me to do what?!
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Just do what I say.
BECKETT
All right, I'll give it a try. But no apologies if I happen to
destroy the entire bloody city.
SHEPPARD
Stardrive, Carson. Concentrate on the stardrive.
BECKETT
(sighing)
Right.
SHEPPARD
And, Teyla, you may have to fight your way in.
TEYLA
I'm ready, Colonel.
SHEPPARD
Use your ARG sparingly. They may build up an immunity. You may have
to go to Plan ... B.
BECKETT
Okay. Which one's that, again?
[McKay rolls his eyes.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Never mind. Just go.
INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM
[Teyla enters and destroys the four guards there with two ARGs.]
TEYLA
Clear.
[Beckett enters and approaches the chair.]
BECKETT
Thank you, dear.
TEYLA
Hurry.
[He sits in the chair and activates it.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The hole in the window is still present where the Puddle Jumper
escaped, but another window has appeared behind it. Everything else
looks fine. The Replicators return to the controls.]
CETUS
They've taken out the guards in the Chair Room.
[They notice a display lighting.]
TALUS
What are they doing?
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett scrunches his face in concentration.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
[Drones come out through a tube in the city. The three drones rise and
then fall.]
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett concentrates.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
[The drones go underwater and head underneath the city.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The room rocks from an explosion. Talus indicates some Replicators
should go respond.]
CETUS
They've hit the stardrive.
TALUS
A search and destroy team is on their way to the Chair Room now.
CETUS
Make sure they understand we need them alive.
[Telus leaves.]
INT--CHAIR ROOM
TEYLA
Beckett!
[Beckett fumbles to get out the chair and raise his sidearm, but by the
team he positions himself, Teyla has been stunned, and Beckett is
outnumbered. He slowly lowers his sidearm and kneels in surrender.]
BECKETT
Okay, lads, easy. Easy.
[Replicators grab Beckett and manhandle him and Teyla out of the room.]
INT--ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
[Ronon and Weir finish as Replicators arrive. One grabs Weir as Ronon
loses a fight with two others.]
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER
[Sheppard and McKay finish up and are instantly surrounded by
Replicators.]
SHEPPARD
And I was so sure we were gonna survive this one.
MCKAY
Me too.
[They surrender and are led away.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[McKay and Sheppard are thrown into a cell where the rest of the rescue
team are.]
REPLICATOR
Bring the prisoners from the other cell.
[Some Replicators leave.]
SHEPPARD
Everyone okay?
WEIR
So far.
BECKETT
I'll be fine.
RONON
Why aren't we dead yet?
SHEPPARD
Probably saving us for a little recreational mind-probing. Did
everyone get the...?
TEYLA
(quickly speaking)
We completed our task.
WEIR
So did we. In the nick of time.
RONON
(to Sheppard)
You?
MCKAY
Yeah. Just under the wire.
[Woolsey and O'Neill are led into the cell. Talus stands at the
doorway.]
TALUS
Did you really think you'd be able to stop us?
SHEPPARD
Well, of course we did. Why else would we be here?
O'NEILL
Colonel? Am I gonna have to fire you?
SHEPPARD
No, sir. I think you'll have that to look forward to when we get
back.
TALUS
I'm afraid your plan has been discovered, Colonel Sheppard. It is
over.
[Talus glances at Woolsey, and everyone stares at him.]
WOOLSEY
(protesting)
He put his hand in my forehead. How can you resist that?
O'NEILL
Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England.
TALUS
Mr. Woolsey informed us of everything we need to know. All of your
C-4 has been removed from the emitters. I'm afraid they won't be
destroyed when the Daedalus arrives...which should be in any moment.
Your plan has failed.
[Another Replicator holds out the C-4 they've collected. Weir looks
disappointed.]
CETUS
(over intercom)
Talus. The Daedalus is approaching the planet.
TALUS
(over intercom)
As expected. Activate the shield.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Cetus presses the button.]
REWIND EFFECT TO EARLIER
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER, EARLIER
MCKAY
(snapping his fingers)
C-4. How much do we have?
SHEPPARD
A bunch. Why?
MCKAY
Well, it's desperate...
WEIR
Well, so are we.
MCKAY
We need to split into groups.
SHEPPARD
I was gonna suggest that anyway. Why? What are you thinking?
MCKAY
If we're gonna destroy these guys using Replicator disruptors, we
have to hit them all at once. We'll probably only get a dozen or so
shots off before they manage to figure out the frequency.
SHEPPARD
So, what, you gonna get 'em all to stand in one place at the same
time?
MCKAY
Clever, yes. Or we could figure out a way to send one massive blast
through the city. Look, follow me.
INT--ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER, EARLIER
[McKay is showing the inside of an emitter to the others, demonstrating
while he speaks.]
MCKAY
Atlantis has ten of these emitters with which it creates the city's
shields. So, if we can interface the crystals from the disrupter
weapons with those of the shield emitters, we should be able to
trigger a massive anti-Replicator wave throughout the city.
SHEPPARD
Okay, that's where splitting into teams comes in.
MCKAY
Exactly. Now, I need to show you how to do this, so listen
carefully. You slide out the crystal tray, you take the crystal from
the Replicator weapon, you place it in the third slot from the
right. Third symbol from the left activates the crystal tray. Clear
on that? Great.
[While McKay speaks, he replaces the crystal and activates the tray.]
[The team starts walking away from the emitter.]
TEYLA
They are bound to find one of our groups working on the shield
emitters.
MCKAY
I already thought of that. That's what the C-4's for.
RONON
We blow them up?
MCKAY
No. We feed them misinformation.
SHEPPARD
All right.
(holding up an ARG)
Once you guys have made all your alterations, avoid using your shiny
new toys even if that means getting caught, okay?
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER
MCKAY
If we plant charges in all ten of the shield emitters before the
Daedalus arrives, that way when the Replicators try to activate the
shield...
WOOLSEY
(realizing)
The C-4 detonates, the Daedalus beams a warhead into the city, and
we all get vaporized.
O'NEILL
That sounds more like a Plan F, doesn't it?
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER
[Sheppard and McKay move away from the brig.]
SHEPPARD
General O'Neill didn't buy it, but I think Woolsey did.
MCKAY
Well, I did win a Sears drama festival award when I was a kid. Could
have made it a career if I wanted to.
SHEPPARD
Wish you would've.
MCKAY
Hmm?
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER
[Cetus and Talus again probe Woolsey's and O'Neill's minds.]
CETUS
We need to get to the shield emitter stations. Remove the C-4
explosive you find there.
O'NEILL
Way to resist.
WOOLSEY
I said I wasn't good at this!
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG, PRESENT
CETUS
(over comm)
Talus, the Daedalus is approaching the planet.
TALUS
As expected. Activate the shield.
INT--ATLANTIS OPERATIONS CENTER
[Cetus activates the shield.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The shield raises, and also sends an anti-replicator wave flowing down
through the levels of the city. Everywhere replicators disintegrate,
including those in the brig.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
MCKAY
Ha! It worked! I can't believe it worked!
WEIR
(proudly)
Rodney, amazing.
MCKAY
Well, it was-it was a group effort.
SHEPPARD
Good old Plan D. Works every time. You guys stay here a sec.
[Sheppard and Ronon leave to investigate.]
WOOLSEY
Excuse me, but what just happened?
MCKAY
We turned the shield into a giant Replicator weapon.
O'NEILL
I knew that!
WOOLSEY
You knew?
O'NEILL
Well, I've seen Carter crack enough codes to know that McKay was
faking the door thing.
WOOLSEY
He was? I bought it completely.
TEYLA
I believe that was the point.
WOOLSEY
Wait a minute, you-you used me?
BECKETT
You're alive, and you're welcome.
[Ronon reenters the room.]
RONON
Hey, we're clear.
WEIR
Okay, we've gotta get to the Control Room and contact the Daedalus.
[The start leaving.]
O'NEILL
You see, Richard? You were good for something.
WOOLSEY
(mildly comforted)
Thanks.
EXT--SPACE
[The Daedalus moves through hyperspace.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
KLEINMAN
Sir. I have an incoming message from Atlantis.
CALDWELL
Atlantis? Is it Replicators?
KLEINMAN
No, sir. It has Colonel Sheppard's authentication code.
CALDWELL
Open a channel.
(into comm)
Colonel, I'd like to believe this is you.
SHEPPARD
Well, it is. Authentication code Alpha Delta Charlie Niner Six.
CALDWELL
That code is no longer valid, Colonel.
INT--ATLANTIS STARGATE OPERATIONS CENTER
O'NEILL
Hey, Caldwell. General Jack O'Neill here. That valid enough for you?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
You may have been compromised, sir.
INT--ATLANTIS STARGATE OPERATIONS CENTER
WEIR
We're lowering the city's shields, Steven. You can send a team to
come check us out if you need to. We'll explain everything.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Get a team of marines ready to beam down.
KLEINMAN
Sir.
CALDWELL
Should be an interesting explanation.
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Weir looks around the empty room. O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
Getting all settled in?
WEIR
Easily. Although their decorating..? Little bit spartan for my
liking. But the Replicators did do a fine job on rebuilding Stargate
Operations back to its original state. How about yourself? Do you
check out okay?
O'NEILL
Apparently I don't have any little tiny robots floating in my
bloodstream, which is always nice to hear.
[O'Neill and Weir share commiserating looks.]
WEIR
Huh! That it is. So what now?
O'NEILL
Oh, a jumper ride home to the SGC, followed by a hot shower,
followed by a hot toddy, followed by...
WEIR
I was thinking a...little more selfishly. What are the chances of my
team staying here in Atlantis?
[O'Neill sighs.]
O'NEILL
Oh. Elizabeth, if it were up to me, I'd--
WEIR
It is up to you.
O'NEILL
Right.
(after a pause)
You can stay.
WEIR
Really?
O'NEILL
You're probably still gonna have to get the rubber stamp from the
IOA, but since you saved Woolsey's ass and you did a fair job on
mine, I don't think that'll be a problem.
WEIR
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say thank you very much.
O'NEILL
Hey, you came back to rescue me.
WEIR
Hmm! Yes, we did.
O'NEILL
Of course, next time, consider bringing Carter with you.
[She smiles.]
O'NEILL
Welcome home.
[Weir is overcome with emotion and hugs O'Neill. O'Neill is taken aback
at first, then hesitantly returns the hug.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DUSK
