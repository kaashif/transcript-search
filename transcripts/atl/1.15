Before I Sleep
TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY
[Weir is there. Sheppard steps out to join her. He is geared up and
carrying a backpack.]
SHEPPARD
There you are.
WEIR
Hey, I was just stealing a breath of fresh air. I thought you were
off exploring the city.
SHEPPARD
About to.
[He pulls out a bundle wrapped in maroon fabric.]
SHEPPARD
I picked this up on the mainland. The Athosians made it. Happy
birthday.
[She unwraps it. It's an old ceramic pot.]
WEIR
Hmm. It's beautiful. How did you find out?
SHEPPARD
Mum's the word.
[He leaves.]
WEIR
Hmm.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[McKay watches a large display of Atlantis.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
All right, we're done with the living quarters. We're moving on.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, before you go, did you see anything better than
our current quarters?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, Teyla, and Ford explore the dark hallway, using
flashlights.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
A few. Some of them are pretty nice, actually.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Well, what kind of square footage are we talking about?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
What am I, your realtor, Rodney? We're here to unlock the secrets of
Atlantis.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Yeah, well, I'm looking for a one-bedroom with a den. Preferably
with a balcony, but I'm not married to it. Look--
FORD
(to Sheppard)
Sir, check this out.
MCKAY
(over radio)
We might as well be comfortable, at least until the Wraith get
here--
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Shut up for a second.
[Sheppard joins Ford at the entrance to a room. They look inside.]
INT--ATLANTIS LABORATORY
[They enter the room. The lights come on.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
What? What is it?
TEYLA
(into radio)
Some sort of laboratory.
MCKAY
(over radio)
We've come across dozens of those. The city's full of them.
Something unusual about it?
[Sheppard passes his hand over a console, and it lights up. In front of
them, a chamber lights up to reveal a very old woman standing up
inside.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I'd have to say...yes.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING
[A large group has gathered in front of the stasis chamber.]
MCKAY
Well, we could stand here looking at her all day. What we've got to
do is get her out of this box.
BECKETT
Rodney, we can't take that chance. Look at her. She's at least a
hundred years old.
MCKAY
Which is why every second counts. I mean, she could drop dead while
we stand here arguing.
SHEPPARD
How can she drop dead? You said she was frozen.
MCKAY
Technically, she's in a state of metabolic stasis. Aging slowed
considerably, yes, but not entirely suspended.
TEYLA
You are saying this woman is still alive?
MCKAY
Yes. Life-sign systems indicate viability. According to the initial
data I've been able to access, she's been in that chamber for ten
thousand years.
FORD
Ten thousand years?
SHEPPARD
Doesn't look a day over nine thousand.
MCKAY
She'll continue to age at a very slow rate until she dies, which,
judging by the look of her, seems more likely to occur sooner rather
than later...bringing me back to my original point.
BECKETT
Look at her. She's so old, I'm afraid the process of reviving her
might actually kill her.
MCKAY
We cannot let this chance to talk to a living, breathing Ancient
slip through our fingers. Again.
[He gives Sheppard a sour look, and Sheppard scowls back at him.]
BECKETT
And who knows what state of mind she'll be in? Not to mention the
fact that she might carrying some horrifying contagion.
MCKAY
And who knows what she knows about our city? More importantly, does
she know about any ZPMs lying around?
SHEPPARD
Ah, there's a thought.
WEIR
Revive her.
BECKETT
But, doctor--
WEIR
That's my call.
MCKAY
Thank you.
[Beckett and McKay step away to the control station.]
SHEPPARD
And the whole time we thought the city was abandoned.
TEYLA
Is it possible the Atlanteans left her behind when they abandoned
the city for Earth?
SHEPPARD
Maybe she wanted to stay behind.
FORD
Maybe they forgot about her.
SHEPPARD
In which case, she's going to be really pissed when she wakes up.
WEIR
If she remembers anything at all.
[Later, the old woman is out of the chamber and lying on a table as
Beckett tends to her.]
BECKETT
Breathing, shallow. Pulse, rapid. I'll run an EEG to determine any
brain activity.
[Beckett takes a piece of paper from her hand.]
WEIR
What is it?
BECKETT
I don't know.
[Weir opens it, and McKay reads it.]
MCKAY
It's gate addresses, five of them. M7G-677. We've been to this
planet.
TEYLA
Dr. Weir...
[Teyla has noticed the woman has opened her eyes. The woman looks at
Weir.]
WEIR
Hello. Can you hear me?
[She doesn't respond. McKay waves his hand above her face.]
MCKAY
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Freezer burn.
FORD
I thought she wasn't frozen.
BECKETT
Ten thousand years, you expect her to dance a bloody jig?
MCKAY
Yeah, but it's the eyes, Carson. You got to look at the eyes. The
lights are on but nobody's home. Doesn't take a medical professional
to know that--
WEIR
Of course she can see us...and hear us. Hello. How are you feeling?
OLD WEIR
It worked.
MCKAY
What was that?
WEIR
She said, "It worked."
MCKAY
What does that mean?
SHEPPARD
I assume something worked.
MCKAY
Yes, that's very sharp.
SHEPPARD
Thank you.
WEIR
Hello? Huh. She fell asleep. When she's a bit more stable, transfer
her to the infirmary. And I want video on her at all times,
recording everything. We might not get a second chance at anything
she may say.
MCKAY
Let's hope we get a first, huh?
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay lounge in front of big-screen display of the
Atlantis lay-out.]
SHEPPARD
Too big, huh?
MCKAY
I'm not saying it's too big. I'm just pointing out its dimensions.
SHEPPARD
Hmm. It's not that big--
WEIR
Gentlemen?
SHEPPARD
We were just wondering whether there are any other frozen bodies out
there in Atlantis that we haven't discovered.
MCKAY
And I was just saying there's no way of knowing in the short term.
It'd be like searching every room in every building in Manhattan.
It'll take a while. God knows what other kinds of surprises are out
there, not showing up on the sensors.
WEIR
Ah, that's what we're here to find out.
BECKETT
(over radio)
Dr. Weir?
WEIR
(into radio)
Yes?
BECKETT
(over radio)
You'd better come to the infirmary.
WEIR
(into radio)
Is our patient awake?
BECKETT
(into radio)
Aye, and she's saying the most peculiar things.
WEIR
(into radio)
On our way.
INT--INFIRMARY
[The old woman lies on an infirmary bed, monitors attached and running.
Weir and McKay arrive.]
BECKETT
She's drifting in and out, still very weak, but there's something a
wee bit odd about this woman. She called me Carson. She knows my
name.
MCKAY
Maybe she overheard you talking to someone.
BECKETT
No. I was alone in here when she woke up.
WEIR
What about subconsciously? I've heard stories of coma patients being
able to hear--
BECKETT
No, no, it's more than that. She knows things.
[Weir approaches the woman.]
WEIR
How are you feeling?
OLD WEIR
Look at you. I didn't think I'd see any of you again. Missed you all
so terribly... Even you, Rodney.
BECKETT
You see?
WEIR
I'm sorry? Do we know you?
OLD WEIR
Oh, yes. I'm you, Elizabeth.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
FORD
Time travel?
WEIR
That's what she said. She...somehow found a way to travel back in
time to when the Ancients inhabited the city.
TEYLA
How did she...do this?
WEIR
That will be one of the first questions I ask her when she wakes up
again.
SHEPPARD
If she ever wakes up again.
MCKAY
Let's not be too quick to exclude the possibility that the woman
might be, um... What is the clinical term? "Nuts?"
WEIR
She may be senile, yes, but that doesn't explain how she knows so
much about all of us.
FORD
Is time travel even possible?
MCKAY
Well, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, there's
nothing in the laws of physics to prevent it. Extremely difficult to
achieve, mind you. You need the technology to manipulate black holes
to create wormholes not only through points in space, but time.
SHEPPARD
Not to mention a really nice DeLorean.
MCKAY
Don't even get me started on that movie.
SHEPPARD
I like that movie.
[Beckett enters.]
BECKETT
Results of the DNA test.
(to Weir)
It's a match. She is you.
INT--INFIRMARY
MCKAY
I know what you're thinking. If she's been waiting in that stasis
chamber all these millennia for us to arrive, why didn't the system
automatically attempt to revive her the moment we got here? Answer?
It did. I've been going over the data from our arrival. One of the
first things we noticed was a sudden power surge in the section of
the city where the stasis lab was. It was trying to revive her, only
we didn't know that. All we saw was more power draining from an
already nearly depleted ZPM, so we shut down all secondary systems.
I almost killed her. You. How weird is that?
WEIR
Very. Very, very weird. Looking at yourself...how you will be...
MCKAY
(smiling)
Actually, how you will be, will be different than how she is right
now. See, the moment she went back in time she created a separate
reality, a second you, living in a--in a parallel world. According
to one of many interpretations of quantum theory. I mean, simply
put, this interpretation states that the universe is, in fact, split
into an infinite number of copies of itself in which every possible
outcome to every decision ever made all exists somewhere in this
infinitely layered "multi-universe."
WEIR
Simply put.
MCKAY
Yeah, in a nutshell.
OLD WEIR
Elizabeth? There's so much to tell you. The note...I had a note.
WEIR
Yes.
MCKAY
(speaking quickly)
Yes, yes, yes, yes. We got your note. And forgive my bluntness, but
we really need to know everything about your encounter with the
Ancients, beginning at the point where you went back in time.
Specifically, how you went back in time, because that would be very
useful for us--
WEIR
Rodney... Let me talk.
OLD WEIR
There was an accident. I remember, we arrived through the
Stargate...
FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The expedition is arriving through the Stargate.]
OLD WEIR
(voice over)
The lights came on by themselves, sensing our presence...
WEIR
Who's doing that?
OLD WEIR
(voice over)
The city slowly awoke...
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[Crew-members find the Puddle Jumper bay.]
SCIENTIST
(into radio)
Dr. Weir, you have to see this.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
There are a lot of things I have to see. Just be careful.
[McKay and Sheppard uncover the control stations in the control room.]
MCKAY
This must be the control room. This-this is obviously their version
of a DHD.
SHEPPARD
Oh, obviously.
MCKAY
This area is probably power control systems, some sort of a computer
interface of some kind.
WEIR
Why don't you find out?
MCKAY
Well, see, that's the hitch. We've got lights coming on all over the
city, air starting to circulate, but no power coming out of these
consoles, so...
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
MCKAY
Wait a minute. Back up a second. That isn't the way it happened.
Everything came online when we arrived. It was lights, computers,
power control systems, everything. I was able to access the database
immediately.
OLD WEIR
That's not what happened. Not the first time.
[She falls asleep.]
INT--BECKETT'S OFFICE
WEIR
Isn't there something you can give her?
BECKETT
She's in an extremely fragile state. Her blood pressure is low; her
heart is very weak. If I administer a stimulant, I'm afraid it may
induce a dangerous arrhythmia, or worse.
WEIR
I'm not talking about a strong stimulant, just enough to keep her
alert for a few more minutes at a time. We hardly get a couple of
words out of her before she dozes off.
BECKETT
Which, I might remind you, is not uncommon for a woman of ten
thousand.
WEIR
Carson, I understand your reticence, but trust me when I say I
believe she can handle it... And I know she'd want it.
BECKETT
(smiling)
Okay.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Beckett takes Old Weir's blood pressure. She is sitting up in the bed
now.]
OLD WEIR
It's okay, Carson. I'm just as freaked out about all this as you
are.
[Weir arrives.]
WEIR
How's our patient doing?
BECKETT
Pressure's improving, and as you can tell, she's much more alert.
WEIR
Are you up for getting out of here?
INT--GATE ROOM
[Weir brings in Old Weir in a wheel chair. Personnel go about their
business as Old Weir looks on.]
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[The team and both Weirs have gathered.]
OLD WEIR
Seeing the city like this, sitting on the surface of the ocean. You
can't imagine how relieved I am.
MCKAY
What are you saying? The city didn't rise the first time 'round?
OLD WEIR
No. No. The city was in serious trouble from the very moment we
arrived.
FLASHBACK
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
We're trying to interface these consoles with a temporary battery
power, see if we can access the city's main power systems and get
this place up and running.
SUMNER
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sumner. Can you come down here and meet me,
please? We're three levels down from you.
WEIR
(into radio)
Right away.
[Sheppard and Weir leave.]
MCKAY
How we doing over there?
GRODIN
Nothing yet.
MCKAY
Well, let's see what we can do, then.
INT--ATLANTIS OBSERVATION ROOM
[Sheppard and Weir arrive.]
SUMNER
We've only been able to secure a fraction of the place. It's huge.
WEIR
So it might really be the lost city of Atlantis.
SUMNER
I'd say that's a good bet.
[They approach large windows.]
WEIR
Oh, my God. We're underwater.
SUMNER
I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean. This could be a
problem.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[The console in front of McKay beeps.]
MCKAY
Oh, no.
(into radio)
Dr. Weir, I need to see you in the control room immediately.
[Sheppard and Weir return. McKay has wired a device into an Atlantis
console.]
MCKAY
The city has a shield, some sort of an energy force field holding
the water back. That is, it had a shield. The power systems are
nearing maximum entropy. Our arrival hastened their depletion, big
time.
[A large display shows flashing red boundaries around the city, and a
warning message.]
MCKAY
I mean, you can see, the shield is collapsing rapidly. Several
sections of the city are already flooded.
WEIR
Can we use our own power generators?
MCKAY
I doubt our Naquadah generators can supply enough power to sustain
the shield, and we probably don't have time to try. When I say
rapidly collapsing, I mean rapidly.
WEIR
(into radio)
Colonel Sumner, I need you to order all your security teams to stop
searching the city and fall back to the gate room immediately.
Sumner, do you copy?
SUMNER
Dr. Weir, this is Sumner--
[Over the radio comes the sounds of crashing glass and water, then
nothing but static. Weir and Sheppard are horrified.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
WEIR
Colonel Sumner drowned?
OLD WEIR
(nodding)
And he wasn't the only one to perish.
FLASHBACK
INT--CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
We should start evacuating people through the Stargate.
MCKAY
We can't. Whatever power's left in the system has been diverted to
sustaining the shield holding the ocean back.
WEIR
Do we know why this is happening now?
MCKAY
The shield might've held the water back for another 100 years, but
power consumption spiked when we arrived.
SHEPPARD
This is happening because we arrived?
MCKAY
Yes.
WEIR
What about auxiliary power?
MCKAY
I'll try to interface the gate with one of our generators. Hopefully
there's enough time. Grodin, access the Stargate control systems,
see if you can locate any gate addresses in the database. Won't be
nearly enough power to gate back to Earth, but maybe we'll have
enough to gate elsewhere in Pegasus.
[He goes to work.]
WEIR
Some of our team discovered a bay full of what they're calling
ships.
SHEPPARD
As in space ships? We should check them out.
WEIR
You think you could figure out--
SHEPPARD
I can fly just about anything.
WEIR
Good. Go.
[Sheppard rushes out. The room shakes, causing concern from Weir and
McKay.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[Sheppard and Ford arrive and rush up to one of the Jumpers.]
SHEPPARD
I'll start with this one. You start with one of those.
FORD
What am I looking for?
SHEPPARD
See how many people they can fit. Maybe we can fly out of here.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
GRODIN
Two piers of the city are almost entirely flooded; a third about to
collapse as well.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, these ships look like a good fallback. They can hold
several people each. Learning how to fly them's going to be another
matter.
MCKAY
(into radio)
I'll see if I can pull up a schematic, find a way out.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
This ship seems different than the others.
WEIR
(into radio)
Different how?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
It's a different control console. I've radioed Zelenka. He's on his
way over to check it out.
WEIR
(into radio)
Good, I'm on my way, too.
MCKAY
Oh, no.
WEIR
What's wrong?
MCKAY
The city's going into a last-gasp self-protect mode. Airtight
bulkheads are slamming shut all over the city. We've got people
trapped.
WEIR
Wouldn't that protect them?
MCKAY
It's too little, too late. Most of the rooms are already breached.
We've got people trapped with water rising.
WEIR
Damn.
MCKAY
I'll try to override the system, open the doors, but that's
seriously hampering efforts to rig power to the Stargate.
[The room shakes more violently.]
WEIR
If these ships turn out to be our only way out of here, I don't want
you waiting too long to get up to the bay... Rodney...
MCKAY
Yes, yes, yes, I heard. Go.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The Jumper has a time-travel console in the center. Zelenka is looking
at is as Weir arrives.]
WEIR
How are we doing?
ZELENKA
This ship is different than the others.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, we know that. Why? What's it do?
ZELENKA
I do not know. I will need more time.
WEIR
We don't have time. It's airtight, I assume.
SHEPPARD
It's a space ship. It'd better be.
MCKAY
Major Sheppard, I've located a roof hatch in the gate ship bay. I'll
try to get it open.
[There is a loud bang in the distance.]
WEIR
(into radio)
What was that?
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
Bulkhead doors leading out of the control room have all slammed
shut. We're locked in.
WEIR
(over radio)
Can you get it open?
MCKAY
(into radio)
I'm trying!
[Around the control room, water starts coming through the doors. McKay
looks into the gate room and sees water flooding in, already covering
the bottom third of the Stargate and rising fast.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Forget it. The gate room's flooded.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
(into radio)
Get them open and get up here. We're waiting for you.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
Elizabeth, we're going to keep trying to retract the roof. As soon
as it opens, you go.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

Rodney--
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
Look, there's no time to argue! Catastrophic failure is imminent.
Just lock yourself in and go.
END FLASHBACK
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
OLD WEIR
Despite your efforts, there was nothing you could do, Rodney. Within
seconds, the control room was flooded.
MCKAY
I died?
OLD WEIR
You never gave up trying, right until the end.
MCKAY
(shaken)
Well...a man wonders how he would choose to go out, given such dire
circumstances. Now I know.
OLD WEIR
Trying to save the lives of others.
SHEPPARD
(casually)
But ultimately failing.
MCKAY
I'm sure if I had a few more seconds, I could--
WEIR
Wait a second. Why didn't the fail-safe mechanism engage and raise
the city to the surface?
OLD WEIR
Because there was no fail-safe the first time. Atlantis remained on
the ocean floor. The shield completely collapsed. Water came
crashing in, flooding every room in the city.
(to Ford and Beckett)
You both drowned while attempting to get our people into ships (to
Sheppard)
And we, along with Dr. Zelenka, we found ourselves trapped.
FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Water is rushing in the Jumper bay, as seen through the windshield.]
SHEPPARD
We need to get out of here!
[The rear ramp shuts; Sheppard takes a seat in the pilot's chair.]
SHEPPARD
Did McKay get the hatch open?
ZELENKA
I do not know.
FORD
(over radio)
Major, there's six of us stuck in one of the ships! What do we do?
[The pilot station lights up after Sheppard touches it.]
ZELENKA
What did you do?
SHEPPARD
I don't know. I think I just turned it on. (into radio)
Stand by, Sergeant.
(to Zelenka)
I'm not much for instruction manuals, but I could use one right
about now.
[He pushes a button, and suddenly the ship is in space above the
planet.]
WEIR
Oh, my God.
SHEPPARD
We're in space. What happened?
ZELENKA
Now what did you do?
SHEPPARD
I don't know. I just...

WEIR
What was that?
EXT--SPACE

OLD WEIR
(upset)
We were under attack. We didn't know where we were or who was
shooting at us. And that's when John...

WEIR
Carson!
BECKETT
(into radio)
This is Beckett. I need medical assistance in the conference room
ASAP.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Old Weir is asleep on an infirmary bed. Weir and Sheppard look on.]
SHEPPARD
How's she doing?
WEIR
Stabilized, but still very weak, and getting weaker.
SHEPPARD
Your own mortality, staring you right in the face. I can't imagine
how you must be feeling.
WEIR
When she looks at me, it's as if she's sensing my thoughts, and I'm
sensing hers. It's very unsettling.
SHEPPARD
Just when you thought this place couldn't get any weirder.
[McKay arrives.]
MCKAY
Well, it's obvious. The Puddle Jumper they escaped in must've been
some sort of a time machine. It had to have an additional component
built into it.
SHEPPARD
Flux Capacitor.
MCKAY
Yeah. Question is, where is the time machine now, hmm?
WEIR
Why don't we ask her?
[Old Weir wakes up.]
OLD WEIR
What happened?
WEIR
Can you tell us? The ship that you escaped in, where is it now?
OLD WEIR
It's gone.
FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

Better question is, how do we shoot back?

The next thing I knew...I woke up here.

What, you mean now?
OLD WEIR
No. Then.
FLASHBACK

JANUS
You're awake.
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
His name was Janus. He healed my wounds and explained to me what had
happened.
[Janus is a young man. Weir is dressed in white clothing, the original
version of what she was wearing in the stasis chamber.]
JANUS
Your ship was shot down. We retrieved it from the ocean floor.
WEIR
Major Sheppard? Dr. Zelenka?
JANUS
No one survived.
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
MCKAY
(to Sheppard)
Ha! Ah, the bitter taste of ultimate failure, hmm?
SHEPPARD
Well, if you had just figured out how to fix the damn shield in the
first place, none of us would've died.
[Old Weir smiles and shakes her head at the banter.]
MCKAY
I did everything I could, including valiantly attempting to save
your sorry--
WEIR
Gentlemen... Focus.
(to Old Weir)
Please continue.
OLD WEIR
Needless to say, I was very confused. He explained to me that the
ship we had escaped in was...a time machine. He was the one who
built it. After I was feeling better, he brought me before the
Atlantean Council.
FLASHBACK
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Weir and Janus speak to the counsel.]
MELIA
We welcome you to the city of Atlantis.
WEIR
Thank you.
MELIA
Unfortunately, your arrival has come at a time of great conflict.
We've been under siege for many years and have submerged our city as
a measure of protection.
WEIR
Yes, it's extraordinary. It's how we found the city when we came
through the Stargate.
MOROS
From Earth?
WEIR
Yes.
JANUS
(smiling, standing)
Ten thousand years from now. It should be noted that our actions
have succeeded in protecting the city for so many years.
MELIA
Let us hope Dr. Weir's arrival has not altered this eventuality. By
directly encountering the Wraith, she may have already set in motion
a chain of events that could lead to a future far different from the
one she left.
WEIR
I'm sorry, what are the Wraith?
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
OLD WEIR
They told me of beings called "Wraiths," a vicious, formidable enemy
whose power and technology rivaled their own.
MCKAY
Yes, actually, we've already, um--
OLD WEIR
The Atlanteans sent a delegation, protected by their most powerful
warships in the faint hope of negotiating a truce... One on one,
Atlantean ships were more powerful, but the Wraith were so many.
After that great battle...it was only a matter of time.
FLASHBACK
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
MELIA
We're awaiting the last of our off-world transport ships before
beginning our evacuation through the Stargate.
WEIR
Where will you go?
MELIA
We're returning to Earth. You are welcome to join us.
WEIR
Thank you. That's very kind, but... I'm sure you must understand my
desire to return to the future, to my people. I was hoping I would
be able to use the time machine again, and program it to arrive at
the precise moment we came through the Stargate. And if it was
possible, and you had a ZPM I could take back with me, that would
help us considerably. See, the power systems of the city were
virtually depleted when we--
MOROS
No. Enough of this tampering with time. Causality is not to be
treated so lightly.
JANUS
No one's treating it lightly.
MOROS
You are, with your insistence on continuing these experiments
despite the condemnation of this council. We ordered you to cease
these activities, and yet, here we sit face to face with a visitor
from the future who arrived here in the very machine you agreed not
to construct.
JANUS
We are about to evacuate this city in the hope that it will lie safe
for many years, and then one day, our kind will return...and they
have. It is because of my experiments that we now have the
opportunity--
MOROS
Enough! We have no time for this. I am hereby ordering the
destruction of this time-travel device and all the materials
connected with its design. You are welcome to return to Earth with
our people. You shall not be returning to yours.
[Weir is upset by the order.]
END FLASHBACK
EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING
INT--INFIRMARY
[Beckett briefs Weir, Sheppard, and McKay. Old Weir overhears.]
BECKETT
The last set of test results only confirm the obvious. Her skeletal,
muscular, circulatory, and neuroendocrine systems have all been
decimated by age. I'm seeing renal failure, liver failure, and
evidence of a stroke from her recent collapse.
SHEPPARD
How long does she have?
BECKETT
I doubt she'll live out the night.
OLD WEIR
Please...I don't know how much time I have left to tell the story I
have waited so long to tell. Oh...the council...they were very
upset...
WEIR
Yes. You said they decided to destroy the time machine.
OLD WEIR
I tried to talk them out of it. I couldn't give up hope. Thankfully,
I had an ally.
FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Janus and Weir speak to Melia.]
JANUS
You need to talk to Moros. Dr. Weir was brought here through no
fault of her own. She shouldn't be punished for it.
MELIA
She's free to come with us back to Earth and live among our--
JANUS
She needs to return to her time, not remain in ours.
MELIA
That's not possible. I'm sorry.
WEIR
Wait. I don't think you understand how far we've come, or how much
my people have sacrificed in the hopes of meeting you. We call you
the Ancients. The gate builders. We've crossed galaxies in the hopes
of finding a great people. Please, is there no other way you can
help?
MELIA
We could block the Stargate permanently after the evacuation. That
way, in the future, your team will be unable to come here.
JANUS
If they can't come, the city may never be found.
MELIA
But the lives of her expedition would be saved.
WEIR
Thank you for your generous offer, but we are explorers, just like
you.
JANUS
Which should come as no surprise, since they are the second
evolution of our kind. Don't you understand? This city will survive
ten thousand years.
MELIA
(sympathetic but firm)
The council's decision is final.
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
OLD WEIR
Of course, Janus refused to concede defeat. The more someone told
him not to do something, the more he had to do it. So he came up
with an alternate plan behind the council's back. It was all I could
do to try to keep pace with him.
FLASHBACK
INT--ZPM ROOM
[Janus works at the control console.]
WEIR
May I ask what it is you're doing?
JANUS
Calculating the necessary power needed.
WEIR
Needed for...
JANUS
You said the shield collapsed shortly after your arrival. I have to
find a way to extend the supply of power. What is it you called
them?
WEIR
ZPM. Zero point module.
JANUS
Yes... They're designed to operate in parallel, all three providing
power to the city simultaneously. However, used in sequence, it may
be possible to sustain the necessary power for the needed time.
[He pushes a button, and 3 ZPM's rise out of the power unit.]
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
I couldn't believe my eyes. Three ZPMs, right in front of me.
JANUS
There is one small problem, however. Someone will need to remain
behind in the city to transfer the power from one device to the
other, to rotate them sequentially.
WEIR
Over thousands of years?
JANUS
It is possible.
MELIA
(over intercom)
Janus, please report to central control.
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
OLD WEIR
Their transport ship was inbound. It was taking heavy fire.
FLASHBACK
INT--CONTROL ROOM
PILOT
(over comm)
Cloaking shields damaged! We're returning fire, but we cannot
access!
MELIA
There's too many enemy ships.
TECHNICIAN
And there are more coming.
JANUS
(into radio)
Engage auxiliary power. Try to outrun them.
(to Weir)
There are over 300 people on that transport.
[Over the comm is heard the pilot and people on the transport yelling
instructions and screaming, and explosions. The map display in the
control room shows the tactical situation. The transport blips out of
existence.]
MOROS
Begin evacuation. We must leave, now.
[Weir looks at Janus questioningly.]
END FLASHBACK
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--INFIRMARY
[McKay sleeps on an infirmary table, Sheppard in a chair. Weir touches
Old Weir's hair, and she awakens.]
OLD WEIR
Damn! Fell asleep again.
WEIR
Well, you're not the only one. Are you in any pain?
OLD WEIR
Would we admit it if we were?
WEIR
I wish there was more we could do for you.
OLD WEIR
Oh, look at you. Always worrying. You put too much pressure on
yourself. Remember that miserable Baltic negotiation? What Simon
told us afterwards?
WEIR
Breathe? Among other things.
OLD WEIR
Enjoy the moment. What's here right now. The sun, the breeze...Our
birthday.
WEIR
Sheppard couldn't keep it to himself, huh?
OLD WEIR
I'm just saying stop being so damn hard on yourself. Life is quick.
WEIR
Not for you.
OLD WEIR
It was my choice, Elizabeth. I didn't second-guess it then, and I
don't regret it now.
FLASHBACK
INT--GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activates. Ancients start to go through.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MELIA
Where is Dr. Weir?
JANUS
She's gone through the gate. She was among the first to evacuate.
MOROS
Good.
[Janus makes inputs on a few controls.]
INT--ANCIENT LABORATORY
[Weir and Janus are in the room with the stasis chamber.]
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
Janus prepared the stasis chamber for me. Said it would be like a
deep, dreamless sleep.
JANUS
I'm inputting commands for the system to revive you twice at
intervals of approximately 3.3 thousand years, so that you can
rotate the ZPMs. I'll give you instructions on how to reactivate the
stasis process afterwards. I'm also entering the necessary commands
to commence final revival the moment sensors indicate the presence
of your expedition team. Look...I feel that I must tell you that
there is a possibility, remote as it is, that this might not
succeed.
WEIR
I know.
JANUS
It's impossible to predict what'll happen over such a long period of
time. I'm convinced that you will survive. But, in the highly
unlikely eventuality that you don't, I've programmed a fail-safe
mechanism to protect the city.
WEIR
A fail-safe?
JANUS
Yes. If the power drains to a critical level, the mechanism holding
the city on the ocean floor will release, and it will rise to the
surface.
WEIR
Really?
INT--GATE ROOM
[Weir watches discreetly as the Atlanteans continue to step through the
event horizon.]
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
And then they left, all of them, returning to Earth through the
Stargate.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Janus is still there, collecting crystals.]
WEIR
What's all that?
JANUS
My research.
WEIR
You're going to build another time ship?
JANUS
I doubt I'll succeed, seeing that the council will be watching my
every move.
WEIR
I'm sure you'll find a way.
JANUS
I've blocked all addresses to the gate except Earth. You will be
safe.
WEIR
Thank you.
JANUS
Thank you...for giving me the hope that Atlantis will survive
another ten thousand years after you discover it again.
[She kisses him on the cheek then heads down the stairs to the Gate
room.]
INT--GATE ROOM
[Janus joins the other leaders.]
JANUS
I'm ready.
[They step through. Janus looks back at Weir and smiles, then goes
through. Weir looks around, realizing she is alone.]
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
And then I was alone. I set the city to slumber...
[Weir works in the control room, shutting down systems and covering
them with silk-like fabric. She goes to the stasis chamber and steps
into it.]
OLD WEIR
(voiceover)
And began my long journey home.
END FLASHBACK
INT--INFIRMARY
WEIR
It worked--the stasis, the fail-safe. You gave up your entire life.
OLD WEIR
No, because we are the same person. The best part of my life is just
beginning. I'm exploring a new galaxy. I have years ahead of me
still.
(touching Weir's face)
Trust yourself, Elizabeth. All that matters...is right now. The
note--I wrote it in case I didn't survive. Has Rodney figured it out
yet?
WEIR
Five gate addresses.
OLD WEIR
Outposts...each one with a Zero Point Module. Janus told me.
[Weir wakes up Sheppard and McKay.]
WEIR
The note she left, it's coordinates of planets to have known ZPMs.
[McKay pulls out the paper, and they look at it.]
SHEPPARD
They could still be there.
MCKAY
M7G-677's on here. This is amazing. Elizabeth, we've got...
[Old Weir dies, the heart monitor signaling the flat-line. They all
stare. Weir approaches the bed and takes her hand.]
WEIR
(whispering)
Thank you.
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
[Weir holds out the pot Sheppard had given her for her birthday,
tipping it to empty some of Old Weir's ashes onto the city. Sheppard
steps out and joins her.]
SHEPPARD
We're about to start our mission briefing, so...
WEIR
I'll be right there. Actually, John? Give me a minute, will you?
SHEPPARD
Sure.
FADE OUT
