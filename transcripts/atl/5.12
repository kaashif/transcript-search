TEASER
EXT--VILLAGE, DUSK
[A village of wooden and metal buildings sits at the foot of some
hills. It appears to be at the level of early industrial development.
Work carries on in the blacksmith's shop as Elson monitors progress.
Several people go about their business in the village.]
INT--CLINIC
[Beckett uses his stethoscope to check a girl's breathing.]
BECKETT
Once more.
[The girl inhales and exhales. Beckett lowers the stethoscope and
sighs.]
BECKETT
(deadpan)
Bad news, I'm afraid. You'll have to go back to school tomorrow.
[The girl giggles and Beckett pretends to snatch her nose, smiling.
Beckett stands and moves over to Novo, who is standing nearby with a
clipboard. They walk over to another man holding his side.]
BECKETT
Maintain the amoxicillin for three more days; that should do the
trick. Now, what do we have over here? All these bandages need to be
changed. Do you mind going back to the store room and getting some
more bandages, please?
NOVO
Yes, Doctor.
BECKETT
Thank you.
[Nola leaves. Beckett pats the man on the shoulder.]
BECKETT
Besides that, you're looking good, my friend.
SHEPPARD
Mail call.
[Beckett spins to find Sheppard and his team entering the home,
carrying supplies.]
BECKETT
Colonel! What are you all doing here?
[Sheppard and Teyla grin.]
SHEPPARD
Well, we heard you needed supplies, so we thought we'd come by and
see how you were doing.
[Ronon and Beckett good-naturedly pretend to spar. McKay is in the
rear, carrying a large duffel bag and looking dour.]
MCKAY
(caustically)
"A hop, skip, and a jump from the 'gate?" That's what you call that?
BECKETT
(grinning)
Nice to see you too, Rodney.
TEYLA
How are you, Doctor?
BECKETT
Well. Thanks. I take it these are the antibiotics I ordered?
[He takes a yellow case from Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
Doctor Keller gave you a whole whack of them. So they should last
for a while.
BECKETT
(sighing)
Ah, God. I wish that were true.
RONON
What does that mean?
BECKETT
Well, I've been dealing with a number of infections from the Hoffan
plague survivors. I can barely keep on top of it.
MCKAY
Survivors of the Hoffan plague? Here?
TEYLA
This is not one of the planets that Michael targeted.
BECKETT
No, but many of these people actually come from another planet,
Balar. They managed to survive the plague, and just when they
started getting the pieces back together, the Wraith showed up;
tried to wipe them out.
SHEPPARD
(grimacing)
Mm. We heard rumors about that.
MCKAY
Well, the Wraith aren't too pleased to have whole populations out
there that are immune to their feeding.
BECKETT
Just a handful of the Balarans survived. The locals were kind enough
to take them in.
[Novo returns with the bandages.]
NOVO
Doctor?
BECKETT
Novo! These are my friends from Atlantis. Colonel Sheppard, Teyla,
Ronon, and Doctor Rodney McKay. This is Novo. She's been helping me
here in the clinic.
[McKay shoots Novo a winning smile and nods.]
SHEPPARD
Pleasure to meet you.
NOVO
You as well. I've heard a lot about you.
(to Beckett, indicating McKay)
Is he the one?
MCKAY
The one what?
NOVO
From all the funny stories.
[McKay's fixed smile falters. Sheppard and Teyla look amused.]
BECKETT
(eyes widening)
Right! Yeah, well, I hope you all can stay here for dinner. I mean,
uh, the canteen's not fancy, but they do serve up one heckuva stew,
made from a goat-like creature. Delicious!
MCKAY
"Goat-like?"
SHEPPARD
I think it's a great idea. Gives us a chance to catch up and relive
all those..."funny stories."
BECKETT
Aye.
EXT--VILLAGE, DUSK
[Beckett and the team walk through the village.]
MCKAY
So...how's life in the wilds of Pegasus? You got to be missing
Atlantis by now.
BECKETT
Surprisingly, no.
MCKAY
Oh, come on. The hot baths, Playstation...deodorant?
[McKay wrinkles his nose as they pass close by a villager.]
BECKETT
I know it seems a wee bit rough, but it's not. Really. I mean,
wherever I go, people are kind to me. I never want for a meal or a
place to sleep. And to be honest with you, I'm really starting to
feel like I'm making a difference.
[McKay shrugs. In the distance, a woman screams. Ronon and Sheppard
push Beckett and McKay out of the way as they race towards the noise.]
[A patrol of Wraith come marching into the village. Sheppard turns the
corner then immediately dives back into hiding, holding back the others
who try and see what he's spotted.]
MCKAY
(whispering)
What is it?
SHEPPARD
(low)
Wraith.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--VILLAGE, DUSK
[The villagers stare as the Wraith arrive in the main square.
Sheppard's team remain in hiding, watching and waiting.]
RONON
(whispering)
I count nine of them. We can take 'em.
SHEPPARD
(low, but firm)
No. There's too many civilians.
TEYLA
I does not appear to be an ordinary culling.
MCKAY
How do you figure that?
TEYLA
Well, for one thing, there are no darts. And they do not seem to be
attacking the villagers.
[The soldiers part to reveal a lead Wraith standing in their midst.]
WRAITH
Who among you speaks for the rest?
[Elson exchanges looks with another villager.]
ELSON
(calling out)
I am Elson...leader of this village. What do you want with us?
WRAITH
You have recently taken in a group of refugees from another planet.
They are survivors of a plague. It is important that you turn them
over to me immediately.
ELSON
Why?
WRAITH
The reasons why do not concern you. Provided you cooperate, you have
my word we will leave peacefully.
[Elson looks to Jervis and Renni.]
ELSON
And if we don't?
WRAITH
(stepping forward)
That would be a very unwise decision. Our hive will be here before
the night is through. If you have not complied by then, I will give
the word, and your entire village will be destroyed.
(louder)
Turn over these outsiders, and your lives will be spared. Resist,
and you will all die together. The choice is yours.
[The Wraith and his soldiers leave.]
INT--CLINIC DINING ROOM
[Sheppard's team, Novo, and Beckett sit around a table.]
NOVO
I don't understand. They've already destroyed our homeworld. Why
would they hunt the rest of us down as well?
SHEPPARD
(to Beckett)
You didn't tell them?
BECKETT
Not the whole story.
NOVO
What are you talking about?
BECKETT
Novo, remember when I told you that, as a plague survivor, you'd be
immune to the Wraith feeding?
[Novo nods.]
BECKETT
Well, there's a bit more to it than that. Any Wraith who tries to
feed on you or anyone like you will, as a result, die instantly.
[Novo stares at him in shock.]
RONON
You're poison to them.
NOVO
Then we're as good as dead.
SHEPPARD
Not necessarily.
NOVO
They won't tolerate our presence anywhere--not if what you say is
true!
TEYLA
Just because they found you on this world does not mean that there
is nowhere you can hide.
[Sefaris enters with some others.]
SEFARIS
Novo? Did you hear?
NOVO
Yes. This is Sefaris. He's also from Balar.
SEFARIS
The councillors are meeting to discuss whether or not to heed the
Wraith's request.
BECKETT
(standing)
What? Where?
SEFARIS
The mine office. I tried to get in, but they turned me away.
SHEPPARD
Ronon, Teyla, scope out the 'gate. (to McKay and Beckett)
You two stay here, watch these people.
(to Sefaris)
Can you show me where this mine office is?
SEFARIS
Yes.
BECKETT
Colonel, what are you going to say to them?
SHEPPARD
I'm going to give them another way out.
INT--MINE OFFICE
[Sheppard speaks to Elson and the other councillors.]
ELSON
You're telling us that, as a result of this plague, the Balarans are
now deadly to the Wraith?
SHEPPARD
Pretty much.
ELSON
So...the Wraith would never risk culling this village.
SHEPPARD
Mmm, that's true, but that's also why they'd be willing to wipe you
guys out completely. A village that can't be culled's no good to
them.
JERVIS
Did they know?
SHEPPARD
What?
JERVIS
Did the Balarans know they were bringing this curse upon us when
they came here?
SHEPPARD
No, they had no idea.
RENNI
It's not their fault, Jervis!
JERVIS
Maybe not, but that doesn't matter. The Wraith won't rest until
every last plague survivor in this galaxy is dead.
SHEPPARD
Except the Wraith have no idea who they are unless people like you
point them out.
[Jervis bristles.]
ELSON
I'm not happy about this either, Colonel. But what other choice do
we have?
SHEPPARD
Well...we may be able to move all your people...to a different
planet where they'll be safe.
RENNI
You mean leave our homes?
SHEPPARD
Look, I know it's not ideal, but the only other choice is to turn in
a bunch of innocent people. And I know you guys aren't going to do
that, right?
JERVIS
Well, as the Wraith said, they're outsiders.
ELSON
(admonishing)
Jervis, we agreed to let them come here.
JERVIS
I didn't agree. Besides, they weren't a threat at the time. Now
that's changed.
RENNI
(crying)
But they've become like family. Novo lives under my roof. She eats
at my table. My daughter adores her! What am I supposed to tell her?
JERVIS
You'd prefer we all be killed?
TEYLA
(breathless, over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
SHEPPARD
Excuse me.
[He turns away and checks his earpiece is secured.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Go ahead.
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
[Teyla and Ronon are hidden in foliage.]
TEYLA
Ronon and I are at the 'gate. It does not appear to be heavily
guarded.
RONON
It's the same guys from the village. I recognize the commander.
INT--MINING OFFICE
SHEPPARD
What are the odds of you two getting by them?
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
RONON
Pretty good.
[Teyla shoots a glare at Ronon.]
TEYLA
Slim, actually. But much better if you and Rodney join us.
INT--MINING OFFICE
SHEPPARD
Yeah, all right. Hold your position until we can get there.
[He turns off his radio and heads back to the councillors.]
ELDON
What is it?
SHEPPARD
How many people are in this village?
ELDON
Uh, six-seven hundred.
SHEPPARD
Well, we'll be tight for time, but we can manage.
ELDON
What are you suggesting?
SHEPPARD
We take the Wraith out, get everybody through the' gate before the
hive ship comes. You should be safe in Atlantis until we can
relocate you.
JERVIS
Unacceptable.
RENNI
The Balarans don't deserve this. They did nothing but survive a
sickness. It could just as easily have happened to us. If we turn
these people over, we are no better than the Wraith ourselves.
SHEPPARD
Look, even if you cooperate with the Wraith, there's no guarantee
they're going to keep their word. They may kill all of you for being
an inconvenience.
ELDON
All right. What do you want us to do?
SHEPPARD
Be ready to move. Take only what you can carry.
INT--CLINIC
[Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
Let's go, Rodney. We're going to hit the Wraith.
MCKAY
We are?
BECKETT
I'll come with you.
SHEPPARD
Not a chance, Doc.
BECKETT
Colonel--
SHEPPARD
Look, I don't have time to argue. Besides, you've gotta get these
people ready for transport. Once the 'gate's secure, we're going to
have to move fast.
[Sheppard heads out, McKay following.]
BECKETT
(calling after them)
Okay, but be careful.
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
RONON
All right, if we're going to attack, we gotta do it from over there.
TEYLA
Agreed.
[They move through the foliage to another position. Before they reach
it, Ronon spots something and signals Teyla to get down. They hide in
the foliage and watch more Wraith soldiers march by. The Wraith
commander with them pauses, Teyla raises her weapon. The Wraith
continues on.]
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Sheppard and McKay head out of the village.]
MCKAY
As soon as we take the 'gate, we should call in some jumpers. It'll
make evacuating the village a lot faster.
SHEPPARD
Not to mention we can use the extra firepower in case the hive gets
here before we're done.
MCKAY
Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
TEYLA
(breathless, over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Yeah, go ahead.
INT--FOREST, NIGHT
TEYLA
We have a problem. More of the Wraith have begun arriving back. They
must have been out on patrol.
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How many? Can we still get out?
TEYLA
(over radio)
No.
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
TEYLA
(into radio)
For the time being, we're stuck here.
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.]
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
INT--MINING OFFICE
[Sheppard and McKay have rejoined the villagers.]
JERVIS
You said you could get us out.
SHEPPARD
Well, there are more Wraith than we thought. The 'gate's too heavily
guarded.
RENNI
(frightened)
So we're trapped?
SHEPPARD
For the moment. I haven't given up hope. I just need time to develop
a new strategy.
JERVIS
What strategy do you propose we use to defeat an army of Wraith?
SHEPPARD
(snappish)
Well, I don't know. I haven't thought of it yet! Look, worst-case
scenario, my team and I don't show up, the people back on Atlantis
will dial the 'gate and contact us by radio. I can order backup.
ELDON
Will that happen before the hive ship arrives?
SHEPPARD
(conceding)
Probably not.
RENNI
We can't wait that long.
SHEPPARD
For all we know, the Wraith could be lying about the ship.
JERVIS
And why would they do that?
SHEPPARD
(angrily)
I'm just saying, we need to stall as long as possible.
JERVIS
This is madness. Elson, we have to think of the safety of our
people.
SHEPPARD
Oh, I'm thinking about the safety of your people. All your people!
JERVIS
(ignoring Sheppard)
We can't rely on their help! We have to make our own decisions.
ELSON
I need time to think about this.
JERVIS
The time for that is past, Elson. We have to act! And if you're not
prepared to do so, then I will.
[He storms out.]
RENNI
Jervis!
SHEPPARD
What's he going to do?
ELSON
I don't know.
INT--CLINIC
[Sheppard arrives with Elson. Beckett and McKay are the only ones there
aside from the seriously illy Balarans.]
SHEPPARD
Where's Novo and the others?
MCKAY
We sent them home. Why?
SHEPPARD
(gesturing to the infirm)
Can these people walk?
BECKETT
Well, if need be, but...I thought we couldn't get them through the
'gate?
SHEPPARD
Well, we can't for the time being. But...I don't think they're safe
here either.
EXT--BLACKSMITH SHOP, NIGHT
[Jervis meets some workers at the blacksmith's shop.]
JERVIS
Grab your weapons! Come with me.
[Someone tosses Jervis a shotgun. Others are armed with flintlocks,
scythes, pitchforks, and other weapons. They start storming the
village, grabbing Balarans, whether they be men, women, or children,
and herding them together. Jervis heads to Renni's house. She blocks
their path.]
WOMAN
No, no! Please, please don't kill me!
JERVIS
Get out of my way.
RENNI
She's not here, Jervis.
[Jervis pushes her aside and bursts in. No one is there.]
JERVIS
Where is she?
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Novo and Sefaris hide in the village outskirts as Jervis's men walk
past.]
SEFARIS
What are we going to do, Novo?
NOVO
We have to get out of the village.
[They start to leave but find their way barred by some of Jervis's men.
They turn to run the other way, but are blocked in and surrounded.]
INT--CLINIC
[Teyla and Ronon arrive. The others are packing.]
RONON
What the hell's going on out there?
SHEPPARD
Some of the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands.
RONON
Well, let's go stop them.
SHEPPARD
First things first. We've got to move these people. Grab some gear.
[Teyla and Ronon start to help. The door bangs open and Jervis and some
of his men enter with their guns. Sheppard's team raise their own
weapons in a standoff.]
JERVIS
We don't want any trouble, just hand over the Balarans.
SHEPPARD
I don't think so.
JERVIS
Don't make things difficult, Colonel. You had your chance to save
the village; now it's my turn.
RONON
(scornfully)
Saving the village? That's what you call this?
JERVIS
This isn't your affair! It's up to us to decide how to deal with the
situation.
ELSON
(calm but stern)
Yes, it is. But, Jervis, this is not our way.
JERVIS
Our way?! Our way is what got us into this situation in the first
place! We've already given them more than they could have ever asked
for.
BECKETT
All right. Why not just shoot them right now, and get it over with?
It's a death sentence anyway.
(he steps forward, to point blank range of Jervis's gun)
Shoot them yourself, and spare them the torment of being tortured by
the Wraith. You'd be doing them a favor!
TEYLA
(warning)
Carson!
BECKETT
Go on! Kill them all then! If you're that desperate to be done with
them!
[The Balarans stare in fear. Jervis finally lowers his gun. Elson takes
it. The others also lower their guns.]
JERVIS
(sullenly)
You're making a big mistake.
ELSON
Maybe. But at least we do so with a clear conscience.
JERVIS
It doesn't matter anyway.
SHEPPARD
What are you talking about?
JERVIS
My men are already on the way to the 'gate with the first group we
captured. It's too late.
[Sheppard looks murderous.]
EXT--STARGATE AREA, NIGHT
[Wraith patrol the area. The Balarans are gathered in a huddle.]
SEFARIS
What are they going to do to us?
NOVO
Be calm, Sefaris, you're scaring the others.
SEFARIS
Maybe they should be scared. We both know there's no escape from
this.
NOVO
We cannot give up hope.
SEFARIS
Face it, Novo...we've been betrayed. They don't want us here, they
never did. We were doomed the moment we had to leave our homes. And
to think, as a survivor, I used to consider myself one of the lucky
ones.
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Teyla and Ronon meet up with McKay and Sheppard in the village.]
SHEPPARD
Jervis taken care of?
TEYLA
He and his men have been locked up. They will not be giving us any
more trouble. Though I do not think it was necessary to stun them.
[She shoots Ronon a look.]
RONON
(unrepentent)
Felt good, though.
MCKAY
So what now?
SHEPAPRD
We've got to get the rest of the Balarans out of the village.
There's no telling if anybody else might feel the way Jervis does.
TEYLA
Where should we take them?
RONON
The forest?
SHEPPARD
(reluctant)
It's kind of a long haul at night.
MCKAY
Wait a minute. What about the mine? These tracks lead right down to
it. I mean, we just follow them.
RONON
No one gets lost.
MCKAY
Exactly.
SHEPPARD
(to Ronon and Teyla)
All right. Go. Get Beckett and his patients. Bring them here. We're
round up everyone else.
EXT--SPACE
[A hive ship drops out of hyperspace and heads to the planet.]
EXT--STARGATE AREA, NIGHT
[The commanders begin to whisper to each other.]
NOVO
What is it?
SEFARIS
Something's happening.
(calling to Wraith)
What's going on?
WRAITH
You'll be moving shortly.
NOVO
Where?
WRAITH
Your new home. The hive ship has just arrived.
[The Wraith starts to walk away.]
SEFARIS
Wait. I have a proposition for you.
NOVO
What are you doing, Sefaris?
SEFARIS
Something we should've done a long time ago.
WRAITH
There is nothing you have to offer me.
SEFARIS
Don't be so sure. There's someone hiding in the village. He's of far
greater value than all of us put together.
NOVO
(desperate pleading)
Sefaris, no!
SEFARIS
Spare our lives. I'll take you to him.
WRAITH
(smirking)
A fair attempt...but the answer's no.
SEFARIS
My life then.
NOVO
(disgusted)
How could you do this?
SEFARIS
I promise it'll be worth your while.
[The Wraith looks intrigued.]
EXT--VILLAGE MINE PATH BEGINNING, NIGHT
[Teyla guides villagers to join the others walking along the path. She
joins Sheppard and Ronon.]
TEYLA
I believe that is everybody.
RONON
Where's McKay and Beckett?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, what's your status?
INT--CLINIC
[McKay watches Beckett frantically pack more into the full cases.]
MCKAY
(exasperated)
Still at the clinic. Carson decided to pick up a few more supplies.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Tell him to get a move on. We can't stay here forever.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Go ahead, Colonel. We'll catch up.
[He throws a duffel over his shoulder.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You sure?
BECKETT
(into radio)
Absolutely. We'll be right behind you.
EXT--MINE PATH BEGINNING, NIGHT
SHEPPARD
Let's get going. Stay together. Follow the tracks.
[The group follow the mine cart tracks towards the mine.]
INT--CLINIC
BECKETT
There. That should do it. Rodney, can you give me a hand here?
MCKAY
Remind me to bring a sherpa the next time I visit.
[McKay helps Beckett gather up the cases. The door opens. Sefaris
enters, followed by Wraith. Sefaris points to Beckett.]
SEFARIS
Him. He's the one.
[The Wraith stun McKay and Beckett before they can recover from their
surprise.]
SEFARIS
You see? I kept up my end of the bargain.
WRAITH
So you did. Unfortunately, in light of your...condition, keeping you
alive is far too risky.
[He points a dagger blade at Sefaris's throat.]
INT--MINE
[The Balarans are led into the mine by Elson. Sheppard, Teyla, and
Ronon are in the rear of the evacuation. They can hear distant engines
overhead.]
RONON
Darts.
TEYLA
(sighing, concerned)
Rodney and Carson are still not here.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, come in. McKay!
(to Ronon and Teyla)
You guys keep moving. I'm going to go get him.
[Sheppard doubles back at a jog while the others continue down the
mine.]
EXT--VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS
[Sheppard reaches the village just in time to spot McKay and Beckett
sitting back to back unconscious, surrounded by Wraith. A dart flies
overhead, catching them all in its culling beam. Sheppard stares at the
empty spot in horror.]
INT--MINE
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Ronon? Teyla?
TEYLA
(keying radio)
Go ahead.
[The conversation switches from the mine to Sheppard's position in the
village.]
SHEPPARD
The Wraith just got Beckett and McKay.
RONON
What? How?
SHEPPARD
Took 'em up in a dart. I think they're on their way up to a hive.
TEYLA
How did the Wraith know that they were in the village?
SHEPPARD
I think I got an idea.
EXT--SPACE
[The hive ship floats in orbit above the planet.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIG
[Beckett awakens with a groan.]
BECKETT
Ooh...oh.
[Looking around, he becomes instantly alert--sitting up and shaking the
unconscious McKay.]
BECKETT
Rodney...Rodney, wake up!
MCKAY
(groaning)
Oh...God, is it me, or have they juiced up the stun weapons?
(he looks around)
Oh, and they brought us to the hive. That's great.
BECKETT
(panicking)
What are we going to do?
MCKAY
All right, uh, just don't--don't panic. Don't panic. I have...got
lots of experience escaping from these things.
[He stands, groaning as he speaks, and joins Beckett at the door.]
BECKETT
You do?
MCKAY
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been in this situation dozens of times. Always
figured a way out.
BECKETT
How exactly?
MCKAY
Uh, let's see, uh...Last time, uh, Teyla was posing as a queen, so,
um...You know, she...had us released.
BECKETT
Not much chance of that happening.
MCKAY
No, I guess not.
BECKETT
How about the time before that?
MCKAY
Ronon's friend Tyre was pretending to be in league with the Wraith,
but really he was on our side, so...he let us out.
BECKETT
I'm starting to sense a pattern here. You've actually never really
escaped from one of these cells on your own, have you?
MCKAY
(weakly)
First time for everything, right?
BECKETT
(huffing)
Oh, God, Rodney.
MCKAY
Well, just...give me a minute. I'll think of something.
[McKay starts to pace. Beckett looks down the hall.]
BECKETT
I hate to pressure you, Rodney, but I don't think we have a minute.
[McKay turns. The Wraith and a patrol of soldiers approach. The door
opens.]
WRAITH
Bring them.
INT--WRAITH LAB
[The Wraith and his escort lead Beckett and McKay into a lab with
several consoles.]
MCKAY
What is this place?
WRAITH
A lab belonging to my top scientist. For the last six months he has
been studying the deadly toxin that has infiltrated our food supply.
BECKETT
Where is he now?
WRAITH
Dead. He was convinced he had arrived at a foolproof way to detect
the poison. To prove it, he decided to feed on one of his test
subjects.
MCKAY
(smugly)
Guess that didn't work out so well.
WRAITH
He died in excruciating pain. Needless to say, his research has been
stalled ever since. And that's where you come in, Doctor.
[The Wraith shoots Beckett a pointed look.]
BECKETT
Me? What do you expect me to do?
WRAITH
The one who identified you said you had considerable expertise in
dealing with the toxin.
[Beckett gulps.]
WRAITH
He even said you had a hand in developing it. If anyone can find a
way to detect it, you can.
BECKETT
If you think I'm going to help you, you're sorely mistaken.
WRAITH
I anticipated you might say that. Which is why I'm prepared to offer
you an incentive. Thus far, I have spared the lives of the people on
the planet below. If you cooperate, I will continue to do so. But if
you either of you try to cross me in any way...
MCKAY
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We get the picture.
WRAITH
I knew you'd come to see it my way. Get to work.
[The Wraith leaves them. Beckett and McKay exchange concerned looks.]
EXT--VILLAGE NIGHT
INT--VILLAGE JAIL
[Jervis leans back against the bars of the cell. Sheppard comes up
behind him and wraps his arm around Jervis's throat, pinning him to the
bars and holding a gun to his head.]
SHEPPARD
Give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your head off.
JERVIS
(frightened)
What for?
SHEPPARD
How did the Wraith know to grab Beckett?
JERVIS
(innocently)
W-what do you mean? The doctor's been captured?
[Sheppard clicks the hammer back.]
JERVIS
I swear, I had nothing to do with that.
[Sheppard points to the other prisoners with his gun.]
SHEPPARD
What about your men?
JERVIS
No. No, there's no way. The d-doctor has been nothing has been
nothing but good to us.
SHEPPARd Well, they didn't just stumble across the clinic. Somebody
brought them there.</blockquote>
JERVIS
(bitterly)
Well, why don't you ask the Balarans? They're the ones with the most
to gain. One of them probably thought he could save himself by
turning in the doctor.
[Sheppard resets the safety on the pistol and points it away from
Jervis. He still keeps Jervis pinned.]
JERVIS
I told you they were no good, Colonel.
[Sheppard finally releases Jervis and walks away. Jervis rubs his
throat.]
INT--WRAITH LAB
[McKay steps back from one of the consoles. Beckett continues to stare
at a console, not paying attention to McKay.]
MCKAY
Dammit! None of these consoles are hooked into anything. I can't
access any of the ship's systems. What about you? You making any
progress? Carson? Hey! You okay?
[He heads towards his friend.]
BECKETT
I can't do this, Rodney.
MCKAY
What do you mean? You don't...understand it?
BECKETT
(emotional)
No, I mean, I can't do it. Do you realize what'll happen if the
Wraith find a way to detect the Hoffan drug? They'll hunt down every
last person in this galaxy that has it. That's hundreds of thousands
of people, Rodney. Not to mention the fact that when they're
finished, they can start feeding again, indiscriminately.
MCKAY
What's the alternative, huh? We know the Wraith aren't going to just
let the matter drop. We've seen what they can do.
They'll-they'll-they'll wipe out entire villages just to get a few
like the Balarans.
BECKETT
So what am I supposed to do?
MCKAY
I mean, you just...stall! You know, you make it look like you're
working until...we figure out how to get the hell out of here.
BECKETT
(upset)
And then what? Go about our business? Pretend this never happened?
MCKAY
Hey, I never said it was going to be easy, okay? But you can't solve
all of the galaxy's problems in one day! Look, I understand. You
feel guilty. But this is not your fault. You had no idea that any of
this was going to happen.
BECKETT
One of the first things they taught us in medical school was "do no
harm." Now, I'm at a loss right now to figure out how that's even
possible in this situation.
[Rodney looks away, distressed.]
INT--MINE
[Teyla walks amongst the Balarans, reassuring them. She meets up with
Ronon.]
RONON
How are they doing?
TEYLA
They are frightened. I've been trying to reassure them, but it is of
little use.
[Sheppard arrives.]
SHEPPARD
How's it going in here?
TEYLA
We are getting by. What is happening in the village?
SHEPPARD
Ah, not much. Everybody's hiding indoors.
RONON
Why hasn't the hive ship attacked yet?
TEYLA
Do you think it could have something to do with Rodney and Carson's
capture?
SHEPPARD
I don't know, but...we should use this time to come up with a plan.
RONON
Have you got anything?
SHEPPARD
Maybe, but it's going to take some work.
INT--WRAITH LAB
[Beckett stares at a console, gives a start, and gasps. He moves to
another console quickly. McKay notices.]
MCKAY
What is it? You got something?
BECKETT
No.
MCKAY
Are you sure? You got one of those... "Beckett" faces.
BECKETT
(unconvincingly)
Aye, I'm sure, Rodney. Just go back to work.
MCKAY
Well, where are you going?
BECKETT
To talk to the hive commander.
MCKAY
What? Why?
BECKETT
There's something I need to tell him.
MCKAY
Oh, I knew it. You found something. What is it?
[Beckett heads to the sealed door. McKay follows.]
BECKETT
Hey, open up!
MCKAY
Seriously, will you just tell me? You know I'm going to go through
your stuff as soon as you're gone.
BECKETT
Just leave me be, Rodney.
(loudly)
Open the door!
MCKAY
Will you just tell me what's going on?
[The door opens and two guards stand there.]
BECKETT
I need to talk to the commander right away.
(to McKay)
Listen to me, Rodney. I need you to stay here. Don't worry,
everything will be just fine.
(turning back to the Wraith)
Right.
[He steps forward. The door closes, leaving a confused McKay alone in
the lab.]
INT--COMMANDER'S QUARTERS
[The soldiers let Beckett into the room and stand outside. The
commander stands staring at a monitor.]
WRAITH
Doctor. I didn't expect to hear from you so soon. This must be good
news.
BECKETT
For some people, maybe. I'm here to tell you that I'm off the case.
WRAITH
(huffing)
What are you talking about?
BECKETT
I'm not going to do your dirty work for you. Find someone else.
WRAITH
There is no one else!
BECKETT
Then that's too bad for you, isn't it?
WRAITH
You're trying my patience, Doctor. You forget, I control the fate of
the people below.
BECKETT
People will die no matter what I do, so I'm not going to do
anything.
WRAITH
If you refuse to complete the research, then there is only one other
way that you can be of use to me.
[The Wraith holds up his feeding hand.]
WRAITH
And trust me, you won't like it.
BECKETT
(challenging)
You don't scare me anymore. Do you understand? I don't give a damn
what you do to me.
WRAITH
Suit yourself. I'm going to enjoy this...very much.
[The Wraith strikes with his feeding hand. Beckett gasps and shudders.]
[The Wraith suddenly releases his hold, gasping and hyperventilating.
He clutches his side. Beckett is unaltered from the feeding process.]
WRAITH
What is this?
[He collapses to his knees.]
WRAITH
(wheezing)
What have you done to me?
[It collapses onto its side.]
BECKETT
Turns out you were closer to detecting the Hoffan drug than you
thought. It didn't take me long to perfect your blood test. And once
I confirmed it using samples that you provided, I decided to do one
more test just to be certain...on me.
WRAITH
(struggling to breathe)
You have the toxin?
BECKETT
Indeed. And now, so do you.
[The Wraith gasps its last breath and dies.]
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[The door to the commander's quarters opens and Beckett uses the
commander's pistol stunner to shoot the two guards at the entrance. He
runs through the corridor.]
INT--WRAITH LAB
[McKay hears the sound of stunners outside the door. It opens and
Beckett runs inside.]
MCKAY
Carson!
BECKETT
Hello, Rodney. Can you delete this data?
MCKAY
Yeah, of course, but how did you--
BECKETT
I talked the hive commander into feeding on me.
MCKAY
What? What?! Why would you do that?
[Beckett starts to pull out memory cystals and smash them under his
foot.]
BECKETT
I have the Hoffan drug, Rodney. Michael must have given it to me as
a defense against the Wraith.
MCKAY
Well, why didn't you tell me?
BECKETT
Because you would've stopped me from going.
[He moves to another console.]
MCKAY
Yeah, because it's stupid! What would've happened if you were wrong?
BECKETT
I had to do something, Rodney! It's the only chance we had to get
away. Now, will you help me destroy this research before they find
out what I've done?
[He grabs McKay by the shoulder.]
MCKAY
(shaken)
Right.
BECKETT
Okay, great.
[They go back to sabotaging the consoles.]
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[McKay and Beckett sneak through the hallways, each holding a stunner.]
MCKAY
The coast is clear.
BECKETT
What are we doing, exactly?
MCKAY
What do you think? We're looking for a way off the ship.
BECKETT
By wandering aimlessly through the hallways?
MCKAY
I'm not wandering aimlessly. I'm exploring. There's a big
difference.
[They come to a console at the junction of several corridors. McKay
smiles.]
MCKAY
Bingo!
[Beckett starts to move off, then notices McKay has paused and is
typing at the console.]
BECKETT
What are you doing, Rodney?
MCKAY
Hacking into the ship's communications.
BECKETT
Are you sure that's a good idea?
MCKAY
Look, if we don't get in touch with Sheppard, we don't stand any
chance of getting off this ship.
[Beckett stares at McKay. McKay notices his attention and stares
pointedly at Beckett's stunner.]
MCKAY
You're going to have to cover me!
BECKETT
Oh, right! From which direction?
[Beckett nervously spins watching all the corridors.]
INT--MINE
[Sheppard's team's radios start to squelch some static.]
RONON
What was that?
MCKAY
(staticy, over radio)
Sheppard, do you read me?
SHEPPARD
McKay? Is that you?
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[The conversation switches between the hive ship and the mine.]
MCKAY
Oh, thank god! Okay, we are on the hive ship. I've got Beckett with
me.
SHEPPARD
What the hell is going on up there?
MCKAY
We managed to escape.
[Beckett shoots McKay a look.]
MCKAY
(conceding)
Beckett helped.
[Beckett rolls his eyes.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, that's great 'cause we could really use the help.
MCKAY
You?! Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship!
SHEPPARD
That's exactly where you need to be right now because we need
someone to take out the hive's main weapons.
MCKAY
What?!
SHEPPARD
We got a plan, but it's only going to work if we take the hive out
of the picture.
MCKAY
Look, it is bad enough that I hacked into communications. If I start
messing around with other systems, they're gonna--they're gonna
track us down in, like, a matter of minutes.
SHEPPARD
Rodney, it's the only way to get these people to safety. Once that's
done, we'll figure out a way to get you guys out of there.
[McKay looks to Beckett, who sighs and shrugs.]
MCKAY
(sighing)
All right. I'll see what I can do. Give me a few minutes. That
should be enough time.
SHEPPARD
You're a good man, Rodney.
MCKAY
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't forget about us, okay?
TEYLA
We won't. Good luck.
RONON
Think he's going to be able to pull it off?
SHEPPARD
Well, he'd better. Otherwise this thing's going to go very badly.
[Sheppard and his team move off, barely sparing a glance at Elson, who
has been sitting nearby. Elson looks troubled.]
EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT
[Elson moves through the village, hidden by a hooded cloak.]
INT--VILLAGE BRIG
[Elson arrives at the brig. Jervis sits on a cot.]
ELSON
Jervis? Jervis.
JERVIS
What do you want?
ELSON
We need to talk.
JERVIS
(petulant)
Well, I have nothing to say to you.
ELSON
You were right all along. I should have listened to you.
[Jervis looks over.]
ELSON
The Atlanteans have no idea what they're doing. They claim to have a
plan, but in reality, they're just putting all our lives at risk.
[Jervis stands and walks over to the bars.]
JERVIS
Well...it's a little late now, isn't it?
[Elson holds up the keys.]
ELSON
Is it? If you went to the Wraith at the 'gate right now, do you
think you could get them to honor the original deal?
JERVIS
It's possible. But...I'd have to deliver all of the remaining
outsiders at once.
[Elson stiffens and swallows.]
ELSON
They're in the mine. Hiding in the main chamber.
JERVIS
(shrewdly)
Are the other councillors on board with this?
ELSON
(shaking his head)
The less they know about it, the better.
JERVIS
And you? Can you reconcile this with your conscience?
[Elson appears to swallow in distaste.]
ELSON
Leave that to me. You just make that deal.
[Elson leaves the keys on the bars and heads away. Jervis picks up the
keys and considers this information.]
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[The Wraith second in command strides to the commander's quarters.]
WRAITH SECOND
What is it?
[The guard opens the door to reveal the commander dead inside.]
INT--COMMANDER'S QUARTERS
[The second enters and looks at his dead leader.]
WRAITH SECOND
Search the ship.
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[Beckett backs up close to McKay's console.]
BECKETT
How long's this going to take, Rodney?
MCKAY
Do I rush you while you're performing complicated surgery?
BECKETT
Aye, it's been known to happen.
[The panel beeps.]
MCKAY
All right, I'm in. Now, just need a few minutes to disable the--
[Wraith soldiers arrive and start to fire on them. McKay and Beckett
duck behind the console for cover.]
MCKAY
Oh, geez! I think they found us.
BECKETT
You figure?
MCKAY
Okay, you're going to have to hold them off.
BECKETT
(dubious)
Am I, now?
MCKAY
Yeah, come on, Carson. You can do this, all right?
BECKETT
All right...on-on three.
MCKAY
How about on one?
BECKETT
All right.
RODNEY
Right. And...one!
[Beckett rises and starts firing on the soldiers as McKay stands and
tries to type at the console.]
BECKETT
How's it coming?
MCKAY
Almost there.
[He types frantically. Beckett is able to down a few Wraith, but more
arrive all the time.]
BECKETT
I can't hold them off forever, Rodney. We have to go, now!
MCKAY
All right, that's it! I got it! Let's go!
[McKay and Beckett run back the way they came, the Wraith in pursuit.]
BECKETT
Where are we going?
MCKAY
The dart bay.
BECKETT
You know how to fly a dart?
MCKAY
Well, I've flown jumpers before.
BECKETT
I've been to Tokyo before. It doesn't mean I can speak Japanese.
MCKAY
Well, how hard can it be?
[McKay pauses at another junction, looking at different choices.]
BECKETT
Do you even know where you're going?
MCKAY
Yeah, I pulled up a schematic of the ship on that console.
BECKETT
What? While we were being fired upon?
INT--HIVE SHIP DART BAY
[They reach the dart bay. McKay seals the door shut from the inside.]
MCKAY
All right, that's sealed.
BECKETT
How long do you think it'll hold them?
MCKAY
Not very.
[They stare, overwhelmed at the scale of the large dart bay, which
reaches up out of sight. McKay snaps out of his reverie first and heads
to a dart.]
MCKAY
Well, come on.
[McKay hops into the cockpit. Beckett climbs in after him, trying to
squeeze into the one-person unit.]
MCKAY
(incredulous)
What are you doing?!
BECKETT
I'm getting in.
MCKAY
Well, we can't both fit in here!
BECKETT
You're damn right, I can. Now, shove over!
[McKay grunts and tries to squeeze himself smaller. He looks very
uncomfortable. Beckett is barely in the seat, his knees up against his
chest.]
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
You comfy?
BECKETT
(drily)
Peachy.
MCKAY
(grunting under his breath)
All right.
[McKay waits, pressing a button on the joystick to no effect.]
BECKETT
What are you waiting for?
MCKAY
Well, it should just start up.
BECKETT
Well, it didn't.
MCKAY
(exasperated)
Yeah, I know that. But it doesn't make any sense. I mean, a canopy
should form over our head. Maybe there's some kind of a weight
limit.
BECKETT
(insulted)
What's that supposed to mean?
MCKAY
I mean, because there's two of us!
BECKETT
Well, maybe you need a key or something.
MCKAY
It's not a Volkswagen, Carson! Okay, look, these are obviously the
flight controls. That makes that propulsion, so...
BECKETT
How did you come up with that brilliant conclusion?
MCKAY
It was just common sense!
(he tries to force a control, and growls)
Oh, come on!
BECKETT
(rolling his eyes)
Right. Common sense.
MCKAY
Look, well what do you want from me? It's not like there's labels!
[They hear blasts outside the sealed door.]
MCKAY
Oh, not good!
BECKETT
You're telling me. We need a new plan, Rodney.
MCKAY
I know. I'm thinking.
BECKETT
Well, whatever you do, think fast, because if those Wraith come
through that door, we're both dead.
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[Wraith continue to try to blast the door open.]
INT--HIVE SHIP DART BAY
BECKETT
Rodney, we need to go.
MCKAY
Where? I mean, we're trapped in here!
BECKETT
Well, then we need to find a place to hide. Come on.
[He grabs McKay's jacket and tries to tug him with him. McKay suddenly
looks inspired, and Beckett notices his expression.]
BECKETT
What?
MCKAY
I have another idea. It's a long shot, but it might work...but
you're going to have to get off me.
[Beckett scrambles to get out of the dart cockpit.]
INT--MINE
[Jervis and his men lead a Wraith patrol through the mine tunnel.]
JERVIS
Once you've taken these people, you're going to leave the village,
right? For good?
WRAITH
This place is of no concern to us. All we want is the Balarans.
JERVIS
There's a large chamber up ahead. That's where they're hiding.
[They reach the large chamber of the mine. It is empty except for
Jervis's team and the Wraith.]
WRAITH
Where are they?
JERVIS
(stammering)
I don't understand. He said they were here! I...they should be right
here!
[They look around in confusion. The Wraith spots something lit on the
ground. He picks it up and shows it to Jervis. It is a block of C-4
with a detonator activated on it.]
WRAITH
What is this?
EXT--PASTURE OVER MINE, DAY
[The pasture sinks in the implosion that destroys the mine. Ronon,
Teyla Sheppard, and Elson and Balarans watch from a distance the smoke
rise, Sheppard closing closing the safety cover on the detonator
control for the explosives.]
RONON
Think we killed enough Wraith to make a difference?
SHEPPARD
Guess we'll find out.
[Sheppard takes a deep breath and bites his lip, glancing back at
Elson.]
SHEPPARD
Nice work.
[Elson glances at Sheppard, his expression deeply grieved.]
INT--WRAITH BRIDGE
[The second in command arrives on the bridge. A Wraith technician works
his console.]
WRAITH TECHNICIAN
We have received word of an explosion on the planet that's killed
several of warriors. The humans continue to attack our troops.
WRAITH SECOND
They're trying to escape. Target the area around the portal and open
fire.
[The technician types some commands.]
WRAITH TECHNICIAN
Weapons aren't responding.
WRAITH SECOND
What?!
EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY
[Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon, and some of the natives are engaged in a
firefight with Wraith near the Stargate. Several Wraith have been
killed. Finally the last one is downed.]
SHEPPARD
(to Teyla)
Dial the 'gate.
[She runs to the DHD. Sheppard runs back to the foliage where Elson and
the Balarans wait out the battle; he loads a new magazine into his
weapon as he moves.]
ELSON
This is the first group. There are more coming.
SHEPPARD
All right, we've got to move fast. They're not going to take this
lying down. Let's go!
[Sheppard leads the way. Elson stays put and points the refugees to
follow.]
ELSON
All right. Come on, let's go. Stay low. Stay low.
[Teyla dials the Stargate, then watches warily for more Wraith.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
WRAITH TECHNICIAN
We've lost contact with the troops at the 'gate.
WRAITH SECOND
What about the two human prisoners?
WRAITH TECHNICIAN
(shaking his head)
They're nowhere to be seen.
WRAITH SECOND
They couldn't have just disappeared... It doesn't matter. We can't
let the villagers escape. Launch the darts.
EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY
[All the villagers move in a hurried but orderly procession towards the
Stargate. Teyla spots darts approaching. She raises her rifle.]
TEYLA
Colonel!
SHEPPARD
Go, go, go! Move!
[The villagers run as the darts approach. Teyla and Sheppard open fire.
Ronon fires his blaster at the darts while pushing the stragglers
towards the Stargate.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, crap!
[Sheppard dives into a roll, barely missing being caught in a culling
beam. Teyla fires as it flies overhead, then spots some women coming
from the woods. She hurries towards them. Ronon sees more darts closing
in from another position.]
RONON
Sheppard! We've got more coming!
[Teyla urges the women forward, covering their rear.]
TEYLA
Go, go, go! You're almost there!
[Sheppard sees a dart nearing Teyla's position.]
SHEPPARD
Teyla!
[He rushes forward. Teyla pauses to shoot. The culling beam activates,
but instead of pulling Teyla up, it dematerializes McKay and Beckett in
front of her.]
TEYLA
(stunned)
Rodney! Carson!
MCKAY
Oh my god, it worked!
BECKETT
Rodney, you're a genius.
TEYLA
What'd you do?
MCKAY
(stammering)
I reprogrammed the culling beam to dematerialize us, then to
discharge only from that point on. I mean, once the Wraith lost
their weapons, I knew it was just a matter of time before they
launched the darts.
[While McKay speaks, Teyla pushes them towards the Stargate. The last
of the villagers runs into the Stargate, Teyla, McKay, and Beckett
follow. Ronon and Sheppard cover their rear, shooting until everyone's
safe. ]
SHEPPARD
Let's go.
[Beckett and Ronon enter the Stargate just before a culling beam
reaches them. The wormhole shuts down.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett works at a computer. McKay enters.]
MCKAY
There you are! I've been calling you!
BECKETT
Oh! I'm sorry. What's up?
MCKAY
Lorne's team just found a suitable planet for the villagers. They're
going to move them out this afternoon.
BECKETT
Aye, I heard. I'm going with them.
MCKAY
(disappointed)
Oh. Right. Of course. Um, well...you want to uh...grab some lunch? I
mean, we didn't get any chance to socialize this time around, unless
you count, you know, running through the halls of the hive ship
as...social time.
[He shoots Beckett a wry smile.]
BECKETT
Aye, you're right. Look, Rodney, I'd love to, but I really need to
get through this.
[He gestures to the computer screens. McKay moves around the table to
look at them too.]
MCKAY
Well, what is it?
BECKETT
Doctor Keller's research on the serum that keeps my cells from
deteriorating. I think there might be something in here to help the
plague survivors, since I'm not getting the infections that they
are.
MCKAY
Well, you don't have do this now! I'll download the data to a drive.
You can just, you know, take it with you.
BECKETT
Actually, you can't. Mr. Woolsey doesn't want it leaving the base.
MCKAY
(grimacing)
Oh.
BECKETT
Sorry, Rodney.
MCKAY
(failing not to sound hurt)
Well, I don't care. No, I was just, you know, trying to stop you
from whining about never seeing me. All right.
[He starts to leave. Beckett sighs.]
BECKETT
Rodney, wait.
[McKay pauses and turns back.]
BECKETT
Now that I think of it, I am a wee bit peckish. Besides, I can't
solve all the galaxy's problems in one day, can I?
[McKay points to himself and shrugs with false humility.]
MCKAY
Well, I--
BECKETT
Shut it. Right, let's go.
[Beckett shuts his laptop and grabs his jacket, joining McKay as they
walk out of the infirmary.]
BECKETT
So? Interested in anyone these days?
MCKAY
(stammering)
Me? No. I-um, I don't have time for that.
BECKETT
(grinning, sly)
You're a terrible liar, Doctor McKay. Tell me, tell me, tell me.
