TITLE
Misbegotten Part 3
PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS
[Scenes from SGA 2.20 "Allies Part 1" and SGA 3.01 "No Man's Land Part
2" are shown.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Weir waits anxiously in the busy control room.]
HARRIMAN
(over intercom)
Incoming wormhole.
(to Weir)
Opening the iris. Receiving video transmission.
[Teyla appears on a monitor.]
TEYLA
(over transmission)
Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.
WEIR
I'm here, Teyla. Any word about our people?
TEYLA
(over comm)
Unfortunately...no. But the hive ship we have been tracking is still
on course for Atlantis. We expect its arrival shortly.
WEIR
(into comm)
Activate the cloak.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
TEYLA
(to Chuck)
Proceed.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[Atlantis disappears from view.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CHUCK
Cloak is engaged.
WEIR
(over comm)
What about our defenses?
TEYLA
(into comm)
All rail gun positions are manned and operational, and Doctor
Beckett is in the drone control chair.
WEIR
(over comm, nodding)
Patch me through to him.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[A tense Beckett sits in the active chair. Several personnel are
around.]
WEIR
(over comm)
Carson?
BECKETT
(nervously)
Elizabeth?
WEIR
(over comm)
How are you doing?
BECKETT
Oh just peachy, thanks. You?
[The conversation switches between Weir's and Beckett's locations.]
WEIR
I'm sorry to put you in this position, but you're the only person
besides Colonel Sheppard and General O'Neill who've actually fired a
drone from that chair.
BECKETT
Ironically, they're the two people I nearly killed when I did that.
WEIR
You'll do fine.
BECKETT
Is this even necessary? I mean, we've got the cloak up. Chances are,
they won't find us and they'll just be on their way.
WEIR
Normally, I would agree with you, but this ship is moving much
faster than we've ever seen a hive ship move before, which means
either it's one of the ships the Daedalus is chasing, or they shared
the information they stole from us with other Wraith. Either way,
the cloak might not do us much good.
BECKETT
(sarcastic)
Great.
EXT--SPACE
[The Wraith ships jumps out of hyperspace and moves toward the Atlantis
planet.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CHUCK
Hive ship just jumped out of hyperspace.
TEYLA
Doctor Beckett, stand by.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett gulps and waits.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Weir and Harriman listen intently for news.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Everyone nervously watches.]
CHUCK
Receiving a signal.
SHEPPARD
(over comm)
Atlantis, this is Sheppard. Come in.
[Everyone breathes a suprised sigh of relief.]
TEYLA
John?
WEIR
(over comm)
They made it?
SHEPPARD
(over comm)
We're out of food, water, and we haven't slept in days, but, yeah we
made it. So...now would not be a good time to fire on us.
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[A smug Sheppard and McKay are on the bridge. Michael works the
controls behind them.]
SHEPPARD
After all, we wouldn't want to damage our new hive ship.
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus undocks from within the hive ship and flies down to the
planet.]
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Beckett walk through the corridor. Sheppard moves
confidently, Beckett looks shocked.]
CALDWELL
(over comm)
This is Daedalus. We're clear.
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
Understood.
(to Beckett)
Sorry to sneak up on you like that, Doc. Subspace communications
were down.
BECKETT
I came this close to blasting you out of the sky!
[He holds his index finger and thumb very close together.]
SHEPPARD
You showed remarkable restraint. Makes me all the more confident in
you next time.
BECKETT
Next time?! Oh-no, no.
SHEPPARD
(ignoring his protests)
Oh yeah. The retrovirus worked great!
BECKETT
(distracted)
Really? How many are there?
SHEPPARD
Well, the ship didn't have a full complement to begin with, but, uh,
still...there are a few.
[They reach a door at the end of the corridor, which opens. Just inside
is a Wraith trapped in stasis. Beckett touches the barrier. He steps
forward to see level after level of Wraith in stasis.]
BECKETT
(flabberghasted)
This...is a few?
SHEPPARD
Official count is just under two hundred. Lot of them were killed in
the battle. Lot more of them killed each other when the gas started
changing them. We should consider ourselves lucky. A hive ship like
this could carry thousands.
BECKETT
(weakly)
Aye.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Weir has been set up in a temporary office on the base. Woolsey sits
in a visitor chair, sipping coffee.]
WOOLSEY
Don't misunderstand me, Doctor Weir. I'm not here to lecture you on
the moral complexities of your situation. Ultimately the IOA has no
official position on the matter one way or the other.
[Weir smiles ruefully, studying Woolsey.]
WEIR
Cause when there's a tough decision to be made, they "suddenly" have
no opinion.
WOOLSEY
The lives of two hundred former Wraith are not high up on their list
of priorities. But the way you dealt with the recent crisis, and
quite frankly the manner in which you responded to their
authority...
(Weir starts to protest)
And there's still the issue of whether the intelligence that allowed
these hives to get as far as they did was passed to any other Wraith
colonies.
WEIR
According to Michael, it was not.
WOOLSEY
I don't have to tell you that your willingness to trust this
particular Wraith is not going to make for a strong defense.
WEIR
I didn't know I was on trial.
WOOLSEY
(sighing)
Look. Pegasus is so far away, they never thought the Wraith would be
a threat to anyone outside the members of the expedition itself.
[Weir shakes her head in disbelief.]
WEIR
It was their objection to having Atlantis under military control
that put me in this position in the first place!
WOOLSEY
Nothing renews your appreciation for the military like the threat of
invasion from life-sucking aliens.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--MICHAEL'S QUARTERS
[Teyla passes the several guards outside Michael's door and enters. He
stands at the window, looking out at the city.]
TEYLA
Michael?
[Michael turns and studies Teyla. She forces herself to face his
scrutiny.]
MICHAEL
Even though I saved Colonel Sheppard's life and helped him stop the
hives from reaching Earth...you still place me under guard.
TEYLA
You have betrayed our trust in the past.
MICHAEL
Trust?! I was your prisoner then. And despite what I've done for
you, here I am once again.
(he chuckles ruefully)
I can't say I'm surprised. I wasn't welcome among my own kind. Why
should I be welcome here?
TEYLA
What are you talking about?
MICHAEL
She looked at me as if I was some kind of unclean "thing." I may
appear as a Wraith again on the outside, but as far as they're
concerned, I'm...that is why I need your help?
[Teyla takes a deep breath.]
TEYLA
What do you want?
MICHAEL
I can't stay here, and I can't return to the Wraith, which means I
need to make my own way. And to do that...
[He starts to step closer. Teyla backs up a step and the guards raise
their weapons. Michael smiles humorlessly.]
MICHAEL
...I need supplies and a ship.
TEYLA
We are grateful for your help, but we can never release you. Not
with the information you possess.
MICHAEL
Then kill me now!
TEYLA
There is another way.
MICHAEL
Take the treatment again.
TEYLA
Yes.
MICHAEL
What I am is not a disease you can cure.
TEYLA
Your life as a human could be long and full.
MICHAEL
And if I remember nothing of what or who I am...if this
consciousness is erased....what is the difference between that and
death? And if I do remember and revert back to my true nature? What
will happen then?
TEYLA
Doctor Beckett has made significant advances. The treatments are
more effective now and eventually he may find a permanent solution.
[Michael approaches. This time Teyla does not back away.]
MICHAEL
If you really believed that, those Wraith you transformed wouldn't
be in stasis on the ship. They'd be here, reveling in your
hospitality.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Weir does paperwork at her desk. There is a knock at the door.]
WEIR
(calling)
Come in.
[Woolsey enters.]
WOOLSEY
Doctor Weir?
[Weir grimaces, but stands to greet him.]
WEIR
Mister Woolsey.
WOOLSEY
The IOA has decided that for the time being, you should continue to
head the Atlantis expedition.
[Weir cannot conceal her surprise.]
WOOLSEY
You're surprised?
WEIR
Yes. I am. I guess this means that international mistrust of the
U.S. military is far more powerful than their fear of "life-sucking
aliens."
[Woolsey smiles at the quote. He starts cleaning his glasses.]
WOOLSEY
The truth is, the delegates are split. In order to avoid a deadlock,
they decided on a temporary reinstatement pending a detailed report
on the situation in Pegasus.
[Weir nods.]
WEIR
Written by...?
WOOLSEY
(shrugs reluctantly)
Me. I'll be going back to Atlantis with you.
WEIR
Have you ever been offworld before, Mister Woolsey?
WOOLSEY
Sure. Once.
WEIR
And how did that go for you?
WOOLSEY
I was nearly killed.
WEIR
Well, we will do our best to make sure that doesn't happen...this
time.
[They share a small smile. Woolsey turns to go, but pauses.]
WOOLSEY
I understand that Stargate Command has put in a request to the
Asgard for transportation?
WEIR
I know they don't have an awful lot of ships to spare right now, but
that will shave almost two weeks off our travel time.
WOOLSEY
I've never met an Asgard.
WEIR
(with deceptive enthusiasm)
You, I think will love them. They've got a great sense of humor.
WOOLSEY
(brightening)
Really?
[Weir takes pity on him.]
WEIR
No.
[Crestfallen, Woolsey nods and leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Wraith ship flies in orbit above Atlantis.]
INT--HIVE BRIDGE
[Sheppard arrives to the bridge. It is full of Atlantis personnel,
including McKay.]
SHEPPARD
Did you figure out how to fly this thing yet?
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, fly, shimmy, spin like a top. You didn't think it'd be
hard, did you?
SHEPPARD
Just proves my confidence in you wasn't misplaced.
MCKAY
So far, we can't get the ship to respond to anything but the most
basic commands.
SHEPPARD
That doesn't do us much good.
MCKAY
Really. Look, all the more sophisticated systems, like navigation,
respond to Wraith neural interface in much the same way that the
puddle jumpers can be only controlled by people with the ATA genes.
SHEPPARD
So we still need a Wraith to fly it.
MCKAY
I'm working on a manual override! I just haven't had much luck yet.
SHEPPARD
(pointing excitedly)
What about Teyla? Teyla's got the...Wraith gene thing. Maybe she can
fly it.
MCKAY
It's worth a try, but that's not the only problem. At least half of
the ship's power generating capacity is gone. So even if I had
access to spare parts, which I don't, I doubt I could fix it. Now,
if we're gonna fly this thing and hope for weapons, we need to cut
down on our curent power consumption.
SHEPPARD
Meaning what?
MCKAY
Meaning the two hundred prisoners we've got in stasis? Well, we
can't keep them in there forever.
[Sheppard reacts with concern.]
INT--MICHAEL'S QUARTERS
[Ronon strides in, priming and aiming his weapon at Michael, who
stands.]
MICHAEL
Are you my executioner?
[Ronon smiles.]
RONON
I wish.
[He stuns Michael. Beckett arrives with a syringe ready and injects
Michael in his neck.]
BECKETT
I'm just glad he's not gonna remember this.
EXT--ALIEN PLANET, DAY
[Ronon and Sheppard walk through an established military camp. Atlantis
personnel and very pale humans (former Wraith)
wander the camp.]
RONON
All right. This is weird.
SHEPPARD
Why? It's just a bunch of guys.
RONON
I know what they really are.
SHEPPARD
(warning)
Keep that to yourself, and try to act normal.
[A former Wraith, Lathan, taps Sheppard on the shoulder.]
LATHAN
Colonel Sheppard, I need to speak with you.
[Sheppard jumps, and makes an effort not to raise his weapon at the
man. Ronon moves to a more protective position to the other side of
Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
I'm sorry...
LATHAN
Oh, my name is Lathan. At least, that's what I've been told.
SHEPPARD
Okay.
LATHAN
Many of us have questions, Colonel. Like, how long we're going to be
kept here.
SHEPPARD
Well, that's up to Doctor Beckett.
LATHAN
He said he doesn't know.
SHEPPARD
Which means he doesn't know the exact date. I'm sorry, this is a
medical situation, and he has medical reasons. You people are under
quarantine.
LATHAN
Why only the men?
SHEPPARD
Your women are immune to the strain. So are most of my people.
Um...we've been over this a few times.
LATHAN
I know. I'm--
SHEPPARD
(talking over him)
But until Doctor Beckett can clear you, there's nothing I can do.
[Sheppard and Ronon enter a tent, leaving a frustrated Lathan outside.]
INT--INFIRMARY TENT
[Sheppard watches as a Wraith assistant leaves with some test vials.
When certain they're alone, he approaches Beckett.]
SHEPPARD
How's it coming?
BECKETT
I'm going to need more time.
SHEPPARD
You're better off conducting this research back on Atlantis.
BECKETT
And what? Just leave them here?
SHEPPARD
That was the plan. You remember that, Carson?
BECKETT
But they're not ready yet.
SHEPPARD
You're supposed to teach them to administer the drug themselves.
BECKETT
I have trained several of them to act as my assistants.
SHEPPARD
Well good. Then there should be no problem.
BECKETT
(with frustrated sigh)
Colonel, there's more here to what I'm doing than just sticking
needles in their arms. For one, I have to make sure there's no signs
of reversion.
SHEPPARD
This planet has no gate. They've got no way off. Whatever happens,
we're covered.
BECKETT
That's not what I meant.
RONON
Have any of them started to remember?
BECKETT
I don't think so. The drug seems to keep them stable as long as they
get a daily dose.
[Sheppard grabs Beckett.]
SHEPPARD
We don't have the manpower or the resources to babysit them forever.
BECKETT
Are you telling me if I can't come up with a permanent solution,
that eventually we'll have to abandon them.
SHEPPARD
(nodding)
Eventually.
BECKETT
And then what?
RONON
They'll turn back into the Wraith. And without any other food
supply, they'll start feeding on each other.
BECKETT
Well, I'm not ready to give up just yet. And like it or not, for the
moment they are human and they're my responsibility. Take the ship
back. I'll stay until the first resupply mission.
SHEPPARD
(shaking his head)
That won't be another week at least. We've got to bring back enough
food to last them until they can harvest their own.
BECKETT
I'll be perfectly safe.
[He turns back to his work.]
SHEPPARD
I'm leaving a security team with you.
[Sheppard and Ronon leave.]
EXT--ENCAMPMENT, DAY
[Lathan pauses outside a tent, then enters.]
INT--TENT
[Lathan joins several human-Wraith sitting in the tent. They appear to
be waiting for him.]
MERRICK
What did he say?
LATHAN
Nothing. He won't tell us anything. He's hiding something.
[Michael sits up on a cot. He looks fully human.]
MICHAEL
Like what?
LATHAN
I only know that something's not right. Everything they've told us
about our homeworld, the plague, how they rescued us...I don't
remember a single part.
MICHAEL
Because memory loss is one of the symptoms.
LATHAN
How do you know that's true? We don't know them. We don't even know
ourselves.
[Michael sighs, thinking.]
MICHAEL
They're helping us.
LATHAN
By keeping us trapped here with barely enough food? And no idea when
or if we'll ever be allowed to leave? I say that's not good enough.
WRAITH
What are you suggesting?
MERRICK
They only have a handful of soldiers. We outnumber them ten to one.
MICHAEL
And then what?
LATHAN
They have some sort of ship. That's how we got here. If we have
hostages--
MICHAEL
(interrupting)
What if they're telling the truth? And we are really carrying some
kind of deadly plague? Even if we somehow survive and get away, all
we'll be doing is spreading this disease wherever we go. Do you
really want to risk that?
[Others nod in agreement with him.]
LATHAN
(standing)
If we don't act before that ship leave, we'll be stranded on this
rock forever!
MERRICK
Michael's right, Lathan. It's too risky.
[Lathan looks around, seeing that he has no supporters. He angrily
leaves.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY OUTSIDE OF MESS HALL, NIGHT
[Woolsey grabs an orange and a cupcake from inside the mess hall, then
spots Caldwell leaning on the balustrade outside, drinking coffee and
studying a report. He walks over.]
WOOLSEY
Colonel Caldwell?
CALDWELL
Mister Woolsey.
WOOLSEY
Mind if I join you?
CALDWELL
Of course. How you settling in?
WOOLSEY
(shrugging)
I'm not sure about this uniform.
[He indicates the Atlantis uniform he's wearing.]
CALDWELL
(with small grin)
Well, you'd stand out more in a suit and tie.
WOOLSEY
(rueful)
Believe me, I've done enough of these investigations to realize that
no amount of camouflage is going to disguise who I am or what I'm
doing here.
CALDWELL
You expecting something less than full cooperation?
[Woolsey shoots Caldwell a keen look, then starts peeling his orange.]
WOOLSEY
We're just having a conversation.
CALDWELL
As commander of the Daedalus, I have standing orders to help out
around here whenever possible, but...I'm not a member of this
expedition. I don't answer to the IOA, and unless otherwise directed
by my superiors, I don't have to answer your questions.
[Woolsey shoots Caldwell a humorless smile.]
WOOLSEY
The only reason that you're not the military commander of Atlantis
is that Doctor Weir insisted that post go to Colonel Sheppard. If
she were to leave...you would be the most likely candidate to take
over.
[Now Caldwell is the one to study Woolsey, flashing a humorless smile.]
CALDWELL
That's not why you're here. The IOA doesn't really want
militarization. They're just afraid they may have no other choice.
WOOLSEY
I think you've already spoken to Doctor Weir.
CALDWELL
(shaking his head)
No. I've just been around long enough to know what's goin' on.
WOOLSEY
Sounds like you're saying you won't come out against Doctor Weir
only because you're not confident of the outcome.
[He eats a slice of orange.]
CALDWELL
What I'm saying, Mister Woolsey...is have a pleasant evening.
[He takes his cup and leaves.]
EXT--CAMP, DAY
[Sheppard walks the camp with some of his men.]
SHEPPARD
You guys head back to the ship.
[He heads over to where Beckett speaks to Michael and some other
human-wraiths.]
SHEPPARD
Okay, Doc. Last chance. We're packed up and ready to roll.
BECKETT
Colonel, we've got a problem. Lathan's missing. He didn't turn up
for his last treatment, and nobody's seen him.
(to Michael)
Have they?
MICHAEL
(reluctantly)
No. But...
SHEPPARD
(shrewdly)
But what?
BECKETT
It's all right, Michael. Tell him what you told me.
MICHAEL
Lathan's convinced this whole thing is some kind of elaborate lie. I
tried to tell him you were doing your best to help us, that maybe
the sickness was playing with his mind, but, uh, he wouldn't listen!
[He shrugs helplessly.]
SHEPPARD
You're saying he's not lost, he's hiding.
MICHAEL
(nodding)
It's possible.
BECKETT
Colonel, I think it's best if you find him as soon as possible
before any symptoms of the plague reoccur.
SHEPPARD
(to his men)
Okay, let's get a search party going.
MICHAEL
We'd like to help. He is one of us.
[Sheppard and Beckett exchange looks before Sheppard heads out.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Ronon bends down, checking some of the foliage. Sheppard is next to
him.]
SHEPPARD
Anything?
RONON
Nothing.
SHEPPARD
(keying radio)
Morrison, report.
MORRISON
(over radio)
We're just coming up on the river. Still no sign of him, sir.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right, keep me posted.
[He and Ronon keep moving.]
[In another part of the woods, Michael and three others of his kind
search.]
LATHAN
Michael.
[Lathan appears from behind a tree.]
MICHAEL
(pleased)
Lathan! What are you doing out h ere?
LATHAN
I'm proving a point.
MICHAEL
You missed a treatment.
[The others surround Lathan.]
LATHAN
(excited)
I know. But I'm starting to remember. It's just flashes...images in
my head. But something's definitely coming back to me. Don't you see
what this means? They're not curing us, they're keeping us this way!
We must make our move, and quickly.
MICHAEL
(still smiling)
I'm sorry, but you should've stayed at the camp.
[Too late, Lathan realizes his vulnerable position, surrounded by
Michael's followers.]
LATER
[Ronon and Sheppard still search.]
MORRISON
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Go ahead.
MORRISON
(over radio)
We've found him, sir.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
What's your location?
[In another area of the forest, Morrison stands on a sharp incline.]
MORRISON
(into radio)
We're half-way up the ridge that runs south of the camp. He must've
been trying to climb down and lost his footing.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Are you saying he's injured?
MORRISON
(into radio)
No, sir. He's dead.
[He looks back at where his team crouches by Lathan's body.]
INT--INFIRMARY TENT
[Beckett unrolls his surgical kit. He already wears latex gloves. He
picks up a scalpel.]
MERRICK
I have prepared the injections for this morning's first group.
BECKETT
On you go.
[Beckett doesn't even look over. His concentration is only on making
the first incision in Lathan. Merrick hesitates, watching Beckett.
Beckett realizes he hasn't moved and turns to face the human-wraith
assistant.]
BECKETT
You'll be fine, Merrick. I've seen you do it a dozen times. Besides,
I've got work to do here.
MERRICK
(nervously)
You're going to examine the body?
BECKETT
Well, the cause of death is quite obvious. His neck was broken. But
there are some tests I could perform that could help with my
research. At least, that way something good might come of this.
[Merrick nods and starts to go. Beckett turns back to the autopsy.
Merrick hesitates and looks back at Beckett before leaving the tent.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Weir smiles at Sheppard's team.]
WEIR
We've all logged more than a few miles these past few weeks. I'd
just like to say that seeing you now, sitting across from
me...looking at your faces...it makes me feel very...
[Weir is overcome by emotion and can't finish. She looks away.]
SHEPPARD
You don't have to say it.
TEYLA
We feel the same way you do.
MCKAY
(deadpan)
Oh, she feels hungry too? Hmm?
[Weir smiles. McKay smiles back.]
WEIR
Teyla, I understand navigating the hive ship wasn't a particularly
pleasant experience.
TEYLA
(with rueful chuckle)
The neural interface was quite...exhausting.
MCKAY
And that was just flying in a straight line. I mean, she'll never be
able to pull of anything complex, like, uh, combat maneuverability,
weapons control, uh...
SHEPPARD
How many maneuvers can you pull off with your manual interface?
MCKAY
Well, does, um, standing still count as a maneuver?
SHEPPARD
No.
[Weir tries to hide her amusement. The door opens, and Woolsey briskly
enters.]
WOOLSEY
Sorry I'm late. My interviews are running a little longer than
expected.
[He heads to a seat and opens his briefcase. The team looks at him in
confusion.]
SHEPPARD
And you are...?
WEIR
Richard Woolsey. He is chief liaison to the international committee
that oversees the Atlantis expedition. He will be conducting
individual interviews with each of you.
[Teyla and Ronon exchange looks.]
WOOLSEY
As well as observing all senior staff meetings.
[He wheels his chair over to the section where Weir sits. She shifts
over with a fixed smile.]
WEIR
Right.
WOOLSEY
So, what did I miss?
SHEPPARD
Rodney was about to run down all the progress he's made adapting the
hive controls.
WOOLSEY
Excellent, please continue.
MCKAY
(nodding to Woolsey)
Hmm.
(low, sarcastic to Sheppard)
Thanks.
[Sheppard nods with an innocent, fixed smile.]
EXT--SOUTH RIDGE, DAY
[Beckett climbs to the area where Lathan was found.]
MORRISON
(over radio)
Doctor Beckett, this is Lieutenant Morrison. What's your location?
BECKETT
(into radio)
I'm out on the ridge where Lathan's body was found.
EXT--CAMP, DAY
[Morrison and his team patrol the camp full of the human-wraiths.]
MORRISON
(into radio)
If you don't mind my asking, Doc, what are you doing out there?
[The rest of the conversation switches between the ridge and the camp.]
BECKETT
I wanted to check on something. I think we may have a problem.
MORRISON
What kind of problem?
BECKETT
I was so caught up running tests on Lathan's tissues for my
research, I almost didn't notice.
MORRISON
Notice what?
BECKETT
There isn't enough blood on the ground, which indicates that his
heart wasn't pumping when he fell. Now, he definitely died when his
neck was snapped. But I'm beginning to think the rest of injuries
occurred post-mortem--presumably to make it look like an accident.
MORRISON
(lower, into radio)
Look, it's going to be dark soon. You'd better start back now, and
we'll talk about it when you get here.
BECKETT
All right.
[Beckett starts to head back.]
[Morrison and his men enter a tent. They don't notice the human-wraith
standing beside the tent who overheard.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Woolsey sits across the table from Sheppard.]
WOOLSEY
It would appear from this incident that the lies you are telling
these..."people" are beginning to wear a bit thin.
SHEPPARD
One adverse reaction out of two hundred.
WOOLSEY
Do you seriously hold out much hope for the long-term success of
this little "science project?"
SHEPPARD
That's not what this is.
WOOLSEY
You may have never set out to create this community, but you did
create it.
SHEPPARD
(leaning forward)
We did what we had to do in order to survive.
WOOLSEY
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. But even if Doctor
Beckett comes up with what appears to be a long-term solution, would
we ever trust them enough to integrate them into any society of
humans?
[While Woolsey speaks, he writes several notes. Sheppard watches
nervously.]
SHEPPARD
(leaning back)
Probably not.
WOOLSEY
Which brings me back to my original question.
SHEPPARD
What do you want me to say? I supported Elizabeth's decision to form
an alliance with Michael, and I supported her decision to put all
those..."people" on the planet.
WOOLSEY
That support hardly shines through when you hesitate to call them
people.
EXT--FOREST, DUSK
[Beckett heads back to the camp. He pauses to catch his breath and
spots a human-wraith heading further into the forest. He follows.]
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Sheppard storms across the balcony and into Weir's office. She is
seated at her desk.]
SHEPPARD
Just out of, uh, political curiosity, how much trouble is it going
to cause you if I knock this Woolsey guy in the head?
WEIR
May I ask why you'd like to do that?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, just an impulse I had, really. One I suspect I'm going to have
again the next time I see him! He may not even have to say anything.
WEIR
I've never seen you like this. What did Woolsey say to you?
SHEPPARD
Well, besides judging every damned decision you've ever made?
WEIR
John Sheppard, are you defending my honor?
SHEPPARD
(nonplussed)
And... judging me for agreeing with you.
WEIR
Well, don't be too hard on him. I think of all the circling wolves,
he's the least likely to actually bite. In fact, he might even
convince the others to leave us alone.
[Sheppard deflates and sits in the chair across her desk.]
SHEPPARD
All right, so, uh...no head knocking.
WEIR
(amused)
It's the thought that counts.
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
[Beckett cautiously moves forward. There is low hum in the distance.
Beckett crouches by a stump and sees several of the human-wraith
standing in a circle around a fire. They are raising their hands above
their heads and chanting the low humming sound.]
BECKETT
(whispering into radio)
Lieutenant Morrison? This is Doctor Beckett. Come in. Morrison?!
[Beckett backs away and turns to run, spinning directly into Michael.
Michael no longer looks human, but has now returned to his hybrid
form.]
MICHAEL
I'm afraid the lieutenant and his men are indisposed.
[Beckett gulps.]
[A bound Beckett is escorted through the woods by Michael and the
others.]
BECKETT
Michael, listen to me. You're sick! You need to take your medication
now!
MICHAEL
It's too late for that, Doctor! I've regained enough memory to know
that you've done this to me not once, but twice! You've witnessed
how hurt, how betrayed I felt the first time? Well try to imagine
how I feel now!
BECKETT
Why'd you have to kill Lathan?
MICHAEL
He was stirring up trouble. But I knew our only chance was to wait
until Colonel Sheppard left with the soldiers. Most of them, anyway.
BECKETT
But with the ship gone, what's the point? You've got no hope of
escape!
MICHAEL
That's where you're wrong.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir types at a laptop. Weir and Sheppard head over.]
WEIR
What've we got, Rodney?
MCKAY
Long range sensors just picked up a hive ship.
SHEPPARD
Coming this way?
MCKAY
No. Wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.
[He hurries over to another station.]
WEIR
What?
[A display shows the hive ship trajectory.]
MCKAY
On it's current course, it's heading straight for the planet where
we left Beckett and the prisoners.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Sheppard's team, Weir, and Woolsey are all there. The ship trajectory
is displayed on a computer screen, and Rodney stands in front of it.]
MCKAY
There is no reason for the Wraith to be interested in that planet.
It doesn't have a Stargate, and there's no indication that it ever
supported a human population. It is completely off the grid.
WOOLSEY
I think we have to consider the possibility that we have a leak.
RONON
You mean a spy.
WOOLSEY
Not necessarily in the city itself. Without ruling anything out, I
would begin by focusing on our contacts within the various
indigenous populations, including...
TEYLA
(interrupting angrily)
If you believe any Athosians--
WEIR
(interrupting)
Let's not jump to any conclusions here.
WOOLSEY
Isn't it true that there are humans in this galaxy who serve the
Wraith, even worship them? How hard would it be for them to
infiltrate one of our allied groups?
[Sheppard and Teyla look at each other.]
WEIR
Mister Woolsey, do you think we post this kind of information on the
city bulletin board?
SHEPPARD
If the Wraith had that level of inside information, they'd be on
their way to Atlantis, not some nameless planet with a couple
hundred people on it.
WEIR
For the time being, we need to focus on getting those people out of
there. Because if the Wraith find them and figure out what they
are...
SHEPPARD
We've got a problem...again.
RONON
How much time do we have?
MCKAY
Two days. Well, we could, uh, well, you could beat them there in the
Daedalus.
WEIR
The hyperdrive is still offline. Hermiod needs at least another
twenty-four hours.
SHEPPARD
We should light a fire under his bony little--
WEIR
(interrupting)
That still might not be quite good enough.
SHEPPARD
If we leave right now in the hive ship?
MCKAY
Oh, we'd be cutting it close.
WEIR
What are our chances of surviving a ship-to-ship encounter?
MCKAY
If I can get the manual interface working, I'd say...less than slim?
WEIR
(nodding)
Do what you can on the way.
[As Woolsey watches, the team heads out.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Several hyprids patrol the camp.]
INT--INFIRMARY TENT
[Beckett is tied to the infirmary bed. Michael paces around him.]
BECKETT
How many have reverted?
MICHAEL
Those you saw in the forest, plus a few more.
BECKETT
And the others?
MICHAEL
They'll serve as an offering to the hive that's coming for us.
BECKETT
That's hardly bloody fair.
MICHAEL
The strong survive, Doctor. The few of us who began to realize
something was wrong got together and formed a plan, even while on
the medication. The weaker minds among us will stay that way thanks
to your drugs and the training you gave us.
BECKETT
If you're memory's coming back, you should remember what happened
last time you tried to rejoin the Wraith.
MICHAEL
It'll be enough to escape this rock!
BECKETT
So what do you need me for?! I mean, there must be a reason you're
keeping me alive!
MICHAEL
(after a pause)
I need to know what secondary security measures Colonel Sheppard put
in place before he left.
BECKETT
What are you talking about?
MICHAEL
The more my memory returns, the more I begin to doubt that he
would've left us here without setting up some kind of failsafe.
BECKETT
There's no way off this planet! That was the failsafe!
[Michael abruptly leans close.]
MICHAEL
How many years of your life will I have to take away before you tell
me what I want to know?
BECKETT
That's hardly a threat, since you're obviously going to kill me
anyway.
MICHAEL
You underestimate your own value, Doctor.
BECKETT
Look! They don't tell me this sort of thing, I'm just a doctor!
Maybe you shouldn't have been so quick to kill Lieutenant Morrison.
[Michael steps back and studies Beckett.]
MICHAEL
I don't like to question military men. They're like our own Wraith
warriors--unimaginative, rigid thought patterns. But you, on the
other hand, are trained to have an open mind. And you have a strong
sense of empathy toward others.
BECKETT
It's not as strong as it used to be, believe me.
[Michael leans closer to Beckett again, his voice taking on a more
echoing quality.]
MICHAEL
You're exactly what I need. Now...let's begin.
[Beckett breathes heavily as he tries to resist Michael's mind
influence.]
EXT--SPACE
[The hive ship flies through hyperspace.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[Teyla has her eyes closed, concentrating on manipulating the controls.
Sheppard watches her, then moves to McKay.]
SHEPPARD
We have weapons yet?
MCKAY
Sort of.
SHEPPARD
And what does that mean?
MCKAY
Well, we can fire, but, uh, not in any particular direction.
SHEPPARD
Well you're going to have to do better than that.
MCKAY
Oh believe me, no one wants to survive this mission more than I do.
Look, we're using up a lot of our power reserves to maintain this
speed. We're not gonna have a lot left over to fight with.
SHEPPARD
We're going this fast to avoid fighting.
MCKAY
Yeah, theoretically.
SHEPPARD
(aggravated)
Just...keep working!
[McKay makes an incredulous face as Sheppard walks away, then gets back
to work.]
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus leaves Atlantis orbit.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Atlantis, this is Daedalus, we're ready to go here.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir stands by the controls.]
WEIR
Are you sure you want to do this, Colonel? I--I understand Hermiod
isn't too happy about having the hyperdrive pressed into service too
soon.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(into comm)
He'd cleared us to fly, albeit reluctantly. Whether or not he's
happy about it is beside the point. Anyway, I'm sure Colonel
Sheppard would appreciate the help.
WEIR
(over radio)
Thank you.
CALDWELL
(into comm)
Daedalus out.
(to helmsman)
Set a course.
HELMSMAN
Yes, sir.
[He moves to his station.]
EXT--SPACE
[The hive ship drops out of hyperspace above a planet.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
MCKAY
That's it. We're out of hyperspace.
[He glances at Teyla as he goes to another station. She exhales and
relaxes the tension of her body, opening her eyes.]
SHEPPARD
You all right?
TEYLA
(nodding)
I believe I have been able to establish a stable orbit.
SHEPPARD
All right, nice work.
(to McKay)
Any sign of the other hive ship?
MCKAY
No, we're clear.
SHEPPARD
All right, patch me through to camp.
MCKAY
All right, just give me a second.
[Several panels around the bridge activate. McKay goes to study them.]
MCKAY
That's weird. A bunch of secondary systems just came online.
SHEPPARD
(pleased)
You're a genius, Rodney.
MCKAY
(concerned)
True. But I didn't do it. It's like they just woke up by themselves.
[Teyla and Ronon exchange looks as McKay goes back to his computer.]
MCKAY
It looks like they're all keyed into the sensors. The ship must've
detected something and turned them on.
SHEPPARD
Detected what?
MCKAY
Oh! Wraith life signs.
TEYLA
From the planet?
SHEPPARD
How many?
MCKAY
It's, uh, twenty or thirty.
RONON
What about human?
MCKAY
Still well over a hundred.
SHEPPARD
So some of them reverted?
RONON
They'll be feeding on each other.
TEYLA
What about Doctor Beckett and Lieutenant Morrison's team?
MCKAY
I have no way to distinguish them from the other human life signs. I
can't say for sure either way.
INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon head through the corridor.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How'd they contact the ship so far out?
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
MCKAY
(into radio)
Well, I have no idea. Teyla, what do you think?
[The rest of this conversation takes place between the bridge and the
trio.]
TEYLA
It is possible that a group of them acting together could
communicate over much larger distances.
SHEPPARD
Well, live and learn.
MCKAY
And live some more, hopefully.
[The trio have now reached the hangar bay and load into their puddle
jumper.]
SHEPPARD
What about the failsafe device? What kind of kill zone are we
looking at?
MCKAY
Everything in a three mile radius is toast.
SHEPPARD
You sure about that? We've got no margin for error.
MCKAY
The blast radius doesn't just stop at three miles.
TEYLA
What about the ones that are still human?
[Sheppard pauses.]
RONON
(sober)
There's nothing we can do for them.
MCKAY
Well, I suppose we could not incinerate them.
SHEPPARD
If Michael got his memory back, they could all know about Atlantis
by now and how to find Earth. We can't take that chance. Once we get
our people out, we'll give you the signal, you set off the nuke.
[He starts flying the puddle jumper out of the bay.]
EXT--CAMP, NIGHT
[The inhabitants have more fully converted into Wraith. From behind
some barrels, Sheppard watches two stride by. He signals behind him for
the others to move up, then heads forward himself. They approach from
behind two Wraith hybrid guards in front of the infirmary tent. Teyla
attacks one, breaking its neck, while Sheppard stabs the other. They
rush into the tent.]
INT--INFIRMARY TENT
[Carson still lies strapped to the table. He is alone.]
TEYLA
Carson!
[She checks his vitals.]
TEYLA
He's barely conscious.
[They both work to free Beckett. Ronon enters.]
SHEPPARD
Did you find the others?
[Ronon holds up dogtags.]
RONON
They were fed on. There's not much of them left.
SHEPPARD
Uhn. Help me get him up.
[They maneuver Beckett off the table.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[McKay paces nervously.]
MCKAY
Aw, come on.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Rodney, come in.
MCKAY
What's happening?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Teyla has Beckett hooked up to oxygen. Sheppard flies the jumper.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
We've got Carson. Morrison and his team are dead. We're heading
back.
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper flies away from the planet.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We're clear. Light it up.
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[McKay moves to the controls.]
MCKAY
Understood. Failsafe detonation in...three...two...one...
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
[The Mark IX has all stages lighted, but nothing happens. Michael and
others are crouched beside it.]
MICHAEL
Now you see what they really think of us.
MERRICK
I don't understand.
MICHAEL
The bomb is receiving a detonation signal. If I hadn't deactivated
it, we'd all be dead.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Rodney?
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
MCKAY
(into comm)
I don't understand it!
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
What happened?
MCKAY
(into comm)
You mean, what didn't happen.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You're telling me the bomb didn't go off?!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
RONON
He got to it.
TEYLA
We cannot leave the Wraith here to be found by the hive.
SHEPPARD
Get back to work on those weapons, Rodney. We're not going anywhere.
EXT--CAMP, DAWN
[The hybrids arrive back in camp to find the ones Teyla and Sheppard
killed.]
MERRICK
Should we search for the prisoner?
MICHAEL
There's no point. He's been taken up to their ship by now. In any
case, he served his purpose. There's nothing left for us to do but
wait for our brothers to rescue us soon.
[He watches the others all go. Michael pauses and looks around the
camp.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[The others join McKay on the bridge.]
SHEPPARD
How're you doing with the weapons.
MCKAY
We couldn't hit the side of a barn!
SHEPPARD
Hive ships are a hundred times--
MCKAY
(clarifying)
A giant, flying barn! We couldn't hit that.
SHEPPARD
What about hitting a stationary target?
MCKAY
All motion in space is relative.
SHEPPARD
I'm talking about on the planet!
MCKAY
Well, that I might be able to do.
SHEPPARD
Target the camp.
BECKETT
Wait just a minute!
SHEPPARD
We've had this discussion before, Doc. There's no choice.
BECKETT
We could go down in a jumper and take as many as possible.
SHEPPARD
We have no time. The other hive ship's gonna be here any minute, and
we won't survive a battle. It's my call.
BECKETT
There's still over a hundred men down there that believe that we are
their saviors.
RONON
They're about to become casualties of war.
[Beckett sighs.]
SHEPPARD
It has to be done.
[Beckett looks horrified. The others exchange troubled looks.]
SHEPPARD
Fire.
[McKay hits the controls.]
EXT--SPACE
[The hive ship starts firing on the planet below. Another hive ship
exits hyperspace. It immediately starts firing on the team's hive
ship.]
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[Explosions rock the ship.]
MCKAY
It's the other hive! We're taking multiple hits!
SHEPPARD
What about the target?
MCKAY
It's hard to say for sure how accurate our fire has been!
SHEPPARD
Blanket the entire area! We can't afford a mistake.
[More, louder explosions rock the ship.]
MCKAY
Engines are off-line! We're venting atmosphere! Power's about to
fail!
EXT--SPACE
[The Atlantis team's ship continues to fire on the planet while the
other hive continues to fire at them.]
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell enters the bridge.]
CALDWELL
Report?
HELMSMAN
We've just about reached the planet, sir.
[Caldwell takes his seat.]
CALDWELL
Drop us out of hyperspace.
EXT--SPACE
[The Daedalus arrives at the planet to find themselves flying through a
large debris field.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell stands and moves closer to the window to look out at the
debris.]
HELMSMAN
It's debris from the hive ship, sir.
CALDWELL
Life signs?
HELMSMAN
No, sir.
CALDWELL
What about the planet?
HELMSMAN
I'm not getting anything.
CALDWELL
(quietly)
I see.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Daedalus, this is Sheppard. Come in.
CALDWELL
(into comm)
Sheppard, where the hell are you?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Teyla looks knowingly at Sheppard. He looks at her blankly before
realizing.]
SHEPPARD
Oh! Right. Sorry.
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper uncloaks where it hovers over Daedalus.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
HELMSMAN
We're picking up a jumper, sir. Five life signs.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You got here in good time, Colonel. We were looking at a long ride
home.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The team exchange looks.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Woolsey sits across from Weir. He is reading a report.]
WOOLSEY
You're still not certain if any of the Wraith on the planet
survived.
WEIR
Not certain, no. My people were concerned about their own survival
at that time.
WOOLSEY
(nodding)
Understandably.
WEIR
But of course, it's my fault they were in that position in the first
place. If I had just disposed of those prisoners, none of this
would've happened. Isn't that what you're gonna write in your
report?
WOOLSEY
Quite the contrary, in fact. It was your decision to fire on the
camp from orbit that eliminated the threat--at least, we hope it was
eliminated--and allowed your team to escape.
WEIR
(confused)
I didn't make that decision.
WOOLSEY
But you would've. If, hypothetically, Doctor McKay had managed to
get the hive subspace communicator working and you'd been apprised
of the situation.
WEIR
(nonplussed)
Well, I...I might have.
WOOLSEY
Close enough.
WEIR
But that's not what happened!
[Woolsey tosses the report in his briefcase and closes it.]
WOOLSEY
The IOA doesn't need to know that. In fact, they don't want to know
that. You see, in my business sometimes it's more important not to
let inconvenient facts get in the way of the greater truth. And the
truth is, you should remain here, in charge of this expedition.
[Weir is taken aback. She looks down.]
WOOLSEY
...for the moment.
[He leaves before she can respond.]
WOOLSEY
(to gate room technicians)
Dial Earth, please.
[Weir goes to the window in her office to watch him leave.]
FADE OUT
