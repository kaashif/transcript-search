TEASER
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Keller and a medical team rush Weir to the infirmary. The unconscious
Weir is strapped down with a neck brace and is receiving oxygen.]
KELLER
(into radio)
She's unresponsive, and her pupils are sluggish. I need you to prep
the O.R. and have the scanner ready when we get there.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Marie is in scrubs and has a sterile environment waiting. The scanner
is being wheeled in.]
MARIE
(into radio)
We're on it. The scanner is moving into position.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[One of the monitors starts beeping.]
MEDIC
She's crashing.
[Keller climbs onto the gurney and begins CPR.]
KELLER
Let's go, guys! I don't want to do this in the hall!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[A monitor resets and starts streaming information. An encouraged McKay
heads back to a station with his computer. His face is covered with
small abrasions from the breaking glass. Sheppard and Teyla are
nearby.]
MCKAY
Here we go, here we go!
SHEPPARD
You got city-wide sensors back online?
MCKAY
Hopefully, yeah. Slowly booting up right now.
TEYLA
Can we contact the Apollo.
MCKAY
Not yet, no.
TEYLA
Why not?
MCKAY
Because subspace communications are down. Don't worry, I got Chuck
working on it.
[McKay nods to Chuck, who's working on some computer towers. Something
short circuits, and he's showered in sparks. McKay rolls his eyes and
continues working.]
SHEPPARD
Well, maybe you should be working on it.
MCKAY
I've got bigger fish to fry.
TEYLA
What could be more important than contacting the Apollo?
[McKay's eyes widen as he studies something on his computer.]
MCKAY
This can't be right.
SHEPPARD
What's wrong?
[McKay heads to another station.]
MCKAY
Power. We're losing massive amounts of power!
INT--INFIRMARY
[Ronon sits on one of the infirmary beds. A large shard of glass is
imbedded in his right shoulder. A doctor is examining him.]
RONON
Just pull it out.
DOCTOR
I can't do that.
RONON
Why not?
DOCTOR
We have to wait to get you under the scanner, make sure pulling it
out's not going to cause even more damage.
RONON
(seething)
Pull...it...out!
DOCTOR
Yeah, yeah, I get it. You're a tough guy. If you want to pull it
out, go ahead, but I'm not going to--
[Ronon reaches to pull out the shard.]
DOCTOR
(panicked)
Are you crazy?!
[At this moment Keller's team wheels Weir in. Ronon pushes the doctor
treating him aside to see what's happening. They move Weir into the
operating room.]
MEDIC
On three, ready? One, two, three.
[They transfer Weir from the gurney to the operating table. Keller
prepares defibrillator paddles.]
KELLER
Clear.
[Everyone moves back, and she shocks Weir.]
KELLER
Charging...
INT--ATLANTIS ZPM ROOM
[Zelenka and others move frantically around.]
ZELENKA
(into radio)
I don't think the problem is on this end.
MCKAY
(over radio)
I don't care where the problem is...
[A technician hands Zelenka a tablet computer.]
TECHNICIAN
Sir.
MCKAY
(continuing over radio)
I want to know what the problem is.
[Zelenka's face falls as he studies the new information.]
ZELENKA
It's in the conduits.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(disappointed)
Oh...
ZELENKA
(over radio)
It looks like...several of the main conduits were affected by the
brush with the beam.
MCKAY
(into radio)
All right, that means we'll need to uh--
[McKay starts frantically moving from one area of the control room to
another.]
ZELENKA
(over radio)
Yes, yes, yes. You-you should get the--
MCKAY
(into radio)
I will as soon as I've shut down all the--
ZELENKA
(over radio)
Yes, yes, yes. I will do the same thing.
SHEPPARD
Wait, wait, wait. What's going on here?
MCKAY
Every second I waste, we're draining more power. Just trust me,
we're doing the right thing here.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
MARIE
No change.
KELLER
Let's start her on Manitol. Two hundred cc's i.v.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
Tell me what's going on, Rodney.
MCKAY
Long story short, there are a bunch of systems on right now that
don't need to be, and given our current situation, they are draining
the life out of the city.
TEYLA
Can you not just shut them off?
MCKAY
Yeah, just wait, uh...maybe. Yeah.
[He goes to another station and frantically types on the laptop.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Keller frantically works to save Weir's life.]
KELLER
Come on.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
Aw, come on.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
KELLER
Time?
MARIE
She's been flat for almost two minutes.
[Keller grits her teeth and shakes her head.]
KELLER
Come, we need you here, Elizabeth.
[A monitor starts beeping rapidly.]
KELLER
She's going back into V-fib. Let's hit her again!
[She grabs the paddles.]
KELLER
Clear.
[She shocks Weir again. After a moment, the heart rate monitor beeps at
a steady rhythm.]
KELLER
There we go. Here we go, let's start the scan.
[The team starts working the scanner. Marie moves over to check the
monitor.]
MARIE
Doctor Keller?
[Keller joins Marie in looking at the brain scan.]
KELLER
That's not good.
MARIE
Her brain is swelling quite seriously.
KELLER
That would explain the sluggish pupils.
MARIE
Yeah, among other things.
KELLER
Give her Nimodipine, thirty milligrams Q four H, and keep an eye on
her blood pressure.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
Nothing. Well, the control grid's all out of whack. I can't shut the
systems down from here. We're...bleeding out.
SHEPPARD
We can shut down the systems manually, right?
MCKAY
(panicked)
I don't think we have the time.
TEYLA
You would rather not try?
MCKAY
Okay, you're right. You're right.
(into radio)
Uh, Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Keller and Marie monitor Weir's progress using the scanner.]
KELLER
She's not responding. We're losing her.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
I'm sending some of my men with your guys in case they need help.
Their ETA's under five minutes. Does that give us enough time?
MCKAY
I don't know. What little power we had night is almost gone. We'll
be lucky if we can make it through the night.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--SPACE
[The city-ship of Atlantis flies through space, the shield surrounding
the city.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay stand alone at the edge of the control room.]
SHEPPARD
(low, to McKay)
Listen...
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
You've been making a lot of decisions here without consulting me.
MCKAY
Well, I'm sorry. We're a little under the gun here. Things move
fast!
SHEPPARD
I understand that, but with Elizabeth...incapacitated, I hate to say
it, but, uh...
MCKAY
(contrite)
You're in charge. I know. I'm sorry.
SHEPPARD
Just keep me in the loop.
MCKAY
Okay. Okay, well, I'll give you the, uh, Cole's Notes.
SHEPPARD
The what?
MCKAY
Uh, the Cliff's Notes?
SHEPPARD
Why didn't you just say that?
MCKAY
Well...never mind. Look, as we were leaving Lantia, we got grazed by
the, uh, Replicators' satellite beam, right? It impacted the side of
the tower, and from what we can tell, it wreaked havoc on a number
of power conduits.
SHEPPARD
So, re-route the power then.
MCKAY
Yeah...it's not so easy. Look, the ZPM room's at the base of the
tower, which means that the conduits in and around where the beam
hit are primary conduits. They can't be...uh, routed around.
SHEPPARD
So parts of the city don't have power?
MCKAY
No, no, no. The-the conduits weren't severed, they were damaged.
Look, it's complicated but...um, imagine them as, uh, leaky pipes,
okay?
SHEPPARD
Okay.
MCKAY
So, you pump water through them, they leak, right?
SHEPPARD
(impatient)
You dumb this down any more, and you're going to get hit.
MCKAY
Sorry. Look, the city realizes that, for whatever reason, power's
not making it to the outer piers. So, instead of repairing the
leaks, which it can't do, it increases the ZPM's output so that even
though the pipes are leaky and we lose power, enough energy makes it
to the end of the line.
SHEPPARD
And that's bad?
MCKAY
No, that's good. Well, otherwise we'd lose the shields, we'd lose
atmosphere, we'd-we'd all be dead.
SHEPPARD
(confused)
Okay.
MCKAY
Look, there are a number of systems on right now that don't need to
be, and they're screaming for power. Look, we're gonna lose juice,
potentially a fatal amount no matter what we do. But, uh, if we can
get those nonessential systems shut down, then the ZPM will need to
pump less power through the leaky pipes and...we'll be able to put
off imminent death for another...hour or so.
SHEPPARD
Mmm. So, then, where are we at?
MCKAY
Oh, well, the teams are making good time. Uh, we've got about sixty
percent of the nonessential systems shut down, so...
[An alert wails from nearby.]
MCKAY
What? What's happening?
CHUCK
(surprised)
The city's outer buildings are decompressing, shutting down the
artificial gravity.
[A monitor shows parts of the shield intersecting with the outer tips
of the city structures.]
TEYLA
Why would the city do such a thing?
MCKAY
It's gonna collapse the shield. It's trying to save power.
SHEPPARD
(urgently)
We've got guys out there.
(into radio)
Matthews, fall back to the tower immediately.
INT--ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR
[Matthews is with two technicians working on a control panel in the
corridor.]
MATTHEWS
I don't think we're done, sir.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
The city shield's collapsing. Move!
INT--ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR
MATTHEWS
You heard the man. Go! Go!
[The trio run towards the tower.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The city schematic shows the decompression sequence as well as the
three life signs of Matthews's team heading through the corridors ahead
of it.]
TEYLA
(somber)
They're not going to make it.
SHEPPARD
S-stop it. Stop it from doing this.
[McKay works some controls.]
MCKAY
The city doesn't think we can maintain the shields unless we make it
smaller. If we delay its collapse, it could fail completely.
SHEPPARD
I don't care! Override it!
MCKAY
It's not letting me.
INT--ATLANTIS OUTER PIER
[Doors seal closed section by section just as the shield collapses
through it.]
[Matthews and his team head down a stairwell.]
MATTHEWS
(into radio)
We're almost there.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
We're going to lose those guys, McKay!
MCKAY
You think I don't realize that?!
MATTHEWS
(over radio)
The gravity just shut down!
INT--ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR
[Matthews's team float above the floor as the shield moves past them,
collapsing inward.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone watches as one by one, the life signs of the three men
disappear. No one speaks for several moments.]
SHEPPARD
(somberly)
Tell the other teams to hurry. I don't want them out there any
longer than they need to be.
[He walks away.]
EXT--SPACE, MIDWAY STATION
[The Midway Station of the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Bridge has now
finished its construction. It floats between the Pegasus and Milky Way
galaxies. Neither Stargate is visible as the station is now thoroughly
enclosed in metal.]
INT--MIDWAY STATION
[Carter floats inside above the Milky Way Stargate. She holds a tablet
computer and pushes herself along to the control section where Lee is.]
CARTER
Hey, are you getting the same data rate inconsistencies off these
flash drives? Bill? Bill?
[She turns to Lee just to see him vomit into a motion sickness bag.]
LEE
Oh, sorry. Oh!
CARTER
Oh boy.
LEE
It's this damn weightlessness.
CARTER
You know, maybe you should 'gate back to Earth. I can get somebody
else to help me bring the station online.
LEE
No, no, I-I'll be fine as soon as I can...figure out how to get the
gravity back on. Uh, what were you saying about the flash drives?
CARTER
Yeah, it's just that every time I update this software, the
drives...
[The sound of chevrons locking can be heard. Carter checks the
monitors.]
CARTER
The Pegasus 'gate just activated.
[Lee floats over.]
ELLIS
(over comm)
This is Colonel Abe Ellis, commander of the Apollo. Midway Station,
please respond.
CARTER
(into radio)
Colonel Ellis, this is Colonel Samantha Carter. I am on the Midway
Station. How did the mission go?
INT--APOLLO BRIDGE
ELLIS
(over radio)
Well, as far as we can tell, Atlantis successfully evaded the
Replicators' beam and was able to enter hyperspace.
INT--MIDWAY STATION
[The rest of the conversation switches from the Midway Station and the
Apollo.]
CARTER
From what you can tell?
ELLIS
Well, they're not at the predetermined rendezvous point.
CARTER
(confused)
Really? They should have beaten you there. Actually, hey, how are
you dialing us? M12-578 doesn't have a 'gate. It's off the grid.
ELLIS
I jumped to the nearest 'gate to see if they've checked in with you.
CARTER
Well, I'm sorry to say that they haven't.
ELLIS
That's probably not good.
CARTER
No. Probably not.
ELLIS
I'll head back, dial you again in an hour, sooner if I hear from
them.
CARTER
Sounds good.
ELLIS
Apollo out.
EXT--SPACE
[Atlantis floats in space. The shield no longer extends to the outer
piers.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Ronon walks around the infirmary, wheeling his i.v. pole. He goes to
where the doctor who treated him and another are monitoring Weir's
surgery.]
DOCTOR
Hey. You should be in bed.
[Ronon merely looks at the doctor, then his attention goes to the
monitor.]
RONON
How's she doing?
DOCTOR
Her brain...is...swelling. Drastically. More than her head can
handle. If it doesn't stop, they're going to have to perform a
decompressive craniectomy. Basically, they, um, cut out a piece of
her skull, and the brain is allowed to expand...outside of her head.
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[McKay heads to Weir's office, where Sheppard stands, staring at her
desk.]
MCKAY
Any word on how she's doing?
SHEPPARD
She's still in the O.R. No real news yet.
MCKAY
Right. Listen, I think we should collapse the shield right to the
tower.
SHEPPARD
That will leave us completely exposed to space.
MCKAY
Yes, it will. But our power is spread so thin right now, I don't
have any extra juice to come up with the solutions to the hundred or
so problems that could lead to our premature demise today.
[Sheppard and McKay start walking the catwalk to the control room.]
SHEPPARD
All right, check with Zelenka. Make sure all the science teams are
accounted for.
MCKAY
Already done. We're ready.
SHEPPARD
All right. Do what you need to do.
MCKAY
(to control room staff)
Okay. Here we go.
[Everyone starts working.]
EXT--SPACE
[The shield collapses around the city ship, eventually only surrounding
the immediate vicinity of the central tower.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY, OPERATING ROOM
MARIE
The calcium channel blockers aren't having much effect.
KELLER
What's her intercranial pressure?
MARIE
Thirty-five.
[Keller closes her eyes and sighs.]
KELLER
I can't let her get to forty. Okay...Let's prep for a decompressive
craniectomy.
[The surgical staff preps for the neurosurgery, shaving Weir's head and
setting clamps around her skull. Keller performs the delicate surgery.
A monitor beeps.]
MARIE
Pressure down to twenty-nine.
KELER
Hopefully, we'll get it under twenty-five.
[She continues the surgery.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay looks over a tablet computer on the Gate Room floor with a
technician. A maintenance worker sweeps away the broken glass nearby.
Teyla and Sheppard enter.]
MCKAY
(to technician)
Hmm...Yeah.
(to Sheppard and Teyla)
All right, two bits of good news. One, I've been able to calculate
our exact location.
[They walk up the stairs to the control room together.]
TEYLA
Does that mean we can use the 'gate?
MCKAY
Sadly, no. To activate the 'gate would require that we stay within a
fairly small area of space. We're moving too fast to use it.
SHEPPARD
Can we use the sub-lights to slow down?
MCKAY
Well, it would be great if they were working, but sub-light and
navigation are out.
SHEPPARD
You decided to put this in the "good news" category?
MCKAY
Yeah, well, at least we're not lost anymore, right? Number two,
there is nothing wrong with our hyperdrives.
TEYLA
Then why did we fall out of hyperspace prematurely?
MCKAY
The damaged power conduits. We had plenty of gas in the tank, so to
speak, we just couldn't get it to the engine. Stalled out.
SHEPPARD
So if we repair the conduits, can we jump back into hyperspace?
MCKAY
That's they idea, yes. I mean, we wouldn't be able to repair them
completely...not without, you know, landing and shutting down, and
such, but, uh, we can definitely patch them up. Look, Zelenka and
his team are working as fast as they possibly can, but the problem
is we're still leaking a lot of power.
TEYLA
Even with all our reductions?
MCKAY
I'm afraid so, yes.
[He punches up a monitor display showing a large patch of green and a
segment of red at the top. It shows the power left in the ZPM.]
MCKAY
Look, this is the minimum amount of power the city requires to
execute a jump into hyperspace. If we don't fix the power conduits
inside of an hour, we'll drop below that level. After that, we're
stuck. We'll have maybe thirty hours before the shields fail, and
we'll all die in the vacuum of space.
[Sheppard stares stonily at McKay as he sighs.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Ronon lies on an infirmary bed, under a blanket. He is not sleeping.
Sheppard enters, heading over to Ronon's bed. Ronon turns and nods to
him.]
SHEPPARD
You okay?
RONON
Yeah, I'm fine. They got all the glass out.
SHEPPARD
Good.
RONON
You need me somewhere?
SHEPPARD
Right here getting better.
RONON
All right, well, I'm good to go.
[Keller exits the operating room and spots Sheppard.]
KELLER
Colonel?
[Sheppard heads over to her. Keller puts her hand on his shoulder and
walks him over to the monitoring station where video monitors show
other surgical staff still working on Weir.]
SHEPPARD
Is she okay?
KELLER
She's alive, but she's in bad shape. She's got six broken ribs, one
of which punctured a lung. Amazingly, she doesn't have any spinal
damage. But...her head got knocked around pretty good. She's
suffering from cerebral edema, which may have caused substantial
brain damage.
SHEPPARD
(worried)
What does all that mean?
KELLER
Well, it's too early to know for sure, but...if she survives, and I
got to stress the "if"...she'll never be the same Elizabeth again.
I'm sorry. I've got to get some things and get back in there. We're
understaffed. Most of our team's on the Apollo.
[Sheppard nods, choked up. Keller leaves him staring at Weir's
monitor.]
INT--ATLANTIS ZPM ROOM
[McKay joins Zelenka in the ZPM room.]
MCKAY
How's it going on this end?
ZELENKA
Actually, you know, remarkably well.
MCKAY
Really?
ZELENKA
Yes, yes, yes. Cannibalizing parts and crystals from secondary
conduits and interfacing them with primary ones is, um...is going
very smoothly. Yes, if we keep our current pace, we should be, uh,
done well before we, uh, drop below the necessary power requirements
to, you know, jump into hyperspace and meet up with the Apollo.
MCKAY
(surprised)
Well, that-that's fantastic!
ZELENKA
Yes. Yeah, I thought you'd be happy.
MCKAY
Happy? Huh, there's actually a chance we might make it through this
thing. I am ecstatic! I am going to do a little--
TECHNICIAN
(over intercom)
Colonel Sheppard? Doctor McKay? Please report to the control room
immediately!
[Zelenka's and McKay's faces fall.]
MCKAY
That lasted what, like a second?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and Sheppard head over to a technician's station. It shows the
city-ship on a trajectory to a semi-circle of several small objects.]
TECHNICIAN
You're going to want to look at this.
SHEPPARD
What is that?
MCKAY
(incredulous)
An asteroid belt?!
SHEPPARD
Are the sub-lights still offline?
TECHNICIAN
Yeah.
SHEPPARD
We're going to need to expand the shield.
MCKAY
We don't have enough power!
SHEPPARD
How long 'till we get there, and how long 'till we get through it?
TECHNICIAN
Uh, about ten minutes till we get there, after that, maybe two
minutes to get through?
SHEPPARD
(skeptical)
Two minutes to get through an asteroid field?
TECHNICIAN
Well, we're not passing all the way through. We're just going to
skim the edge.
[He alters the monitor display to show a cross-section of the asteroid
belt and the city-ship's trajectory hitting the corner of it.]
SHEPPARD
(to McKay)
You can't even give me two minutes at full shield?
MCKAY
Well, don't take it personally. I'd like them up as much as you
would, but we just can't afford the power.
SHEPPARD
Rodney...!
MCKAY
Look, Zelenka needs forty-five minutes to complete the repairs to
the power conduits. If we raise the shields even for one minute,
it'll eat up all his time. We can't do it.
SHEPPARD
(thinking quickly)
Okay. How big are they?
MCKAY
(thinking)
Well, we're in the middle of a pretty big solar system right now,
and the asteroid belt's probably made up of, uh, remnants of early,
failed planets, so, you know...building size and larger?
SHEPPARD
I could get in the chair, fire drones, and clear a path to travel
through.
MCKAY
In principle, a good idea, but the chair room is outside the shield
right now, and we'd never get to it. Look, we could um...ah, that's
not gonna work. We could...
SHEPPARD
How many people on the base have the Ancient gene?
MCKAY
(distracted)
Twenty or so? Look...no.
(realizing Sheppard's plan)
No, no, no, no, no. That is a bad idea.
SHEPPARD
You have a better idea?
MCKAY
Yes!
[Sheppard waits expectantly. McKay pauses.]
MCKAY
I can. I just--I need some time. If you, uh...
[Sheppard heads out.]
SHEPPARD
Contact everyone on the base who has the Ancient gene, tell them to
meet me up at the jumper bay.
[The technician looks at McKay.]
MCKAY
(snarky)
Well, do it!
[He sighs and takes off after Sheppard.]
INT--ATLANTIS JUMPER BAY
[Sheppard briefs various Atlantis medical personnel, scientists, and
technicians as well as McKay.]
SHEPPARD
...which means we can't raise the shield because we don't have
enough power. If we don't clear a through the city, it'll get ripped
apart. So, we're going to take every last jumper we have, and we're
going to clear a path through the belt by firing our drones.
[Everyone murmurs uncertainly. The doctor who had treated Ronon earlier
raises his hand.]
DOCTOR
Excuse me, I've really only flown a jumper twice, and I've never
actually fired a live drone, so, um...
SHEPPARD
You've done it in simulations, right?
DOCTOR
Well, yeah, but...
SHEPPARD
It's basically the same thing. If McKay can do it, you can do it.
MCKAY
(sheepishly)
Yes, look, about that, actually. I...
SHEPPARD
Look, I know it's dangerous. I know a lot of you haven't logged a
lot of hours in these things, but right now...it's the only viable
option we have, or, um...
MCKAY
Or die.
[Some exchange frightened looks. Sheppard winces.]
SHEPPARD
Let's get moving.
[Sheppard glares at McKay before entering his jumper. McKay and the
others scatter to their jumpers, powering them up. Some do it
confidently, others appear very nervous and unsure.]
INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
All right, I've loaded a flight formation for all of you. Stay in
your designated positions and take out anything that's in your path.
You've got a full load of drones, so ammo shouldn't be a problem.
[The rest of the conversation takes place between the various puddle
jumpers. Several of the pilots pull up their HUDs to see the flight
path.]
MCKAY
Looks like the old video game Asteroids.
SHEPPARD
(shrugging)
Whatever works for you.
MCKAY
I was terrible at Asteroids. I think I actually scored zero once.
SHEPPARD
Then there's only one way to go, and that's up. All right, everyone,
let's go. Open the jumper bay doors.
INT--JUMPER BAY
[The jumper bay door opens and the puddle jumpers fly up through it.]
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumpers pass through the shield and line up ahead of
Atlantis, facing the upcoming asteroid belt in a horizontal formation.]
INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard studies the various jumper positions on his HUD.]
SHEPPARD
Come on, guys. Stay in formation. We can't afford any gaps.
[The jumpers start to align better.]
SHEPPARD
Yeah, there you go, see? Not so hard.
INT--SCIENTIST'S PUDDLE JUMPER
[A female scientist who had been looking uncertain begins to look more
confident.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Teyla monitors from the control room.]
TEYLA
Jumpers, you should be in range in three...two...one.
INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Fire at will!
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumpers fly ahead of the city-ship. They begin to fire
their drones at the asteroids. A few of the rocks shatter.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPERS
[The conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's jumpers.]
SHEPPARD
Nice shooting, people.
MCKAY
(panicking)
There's too many of them, and they're coming too fast. We're not
going to get them all!
SHEPPARD
Double up. Fire four a piece.
MCKAY
I can't control four drones at the same time.
SHEPPARD
Well, just concentrate.
[McKay concentrates.]
EXT--SPACE
[McKay's jumper fires four drones. Three hit their targets, but one
just misses. McKay watches the asteroid pass by his ship.]
MCKAY
Dammit!
INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Don't worry about it. You were right. We can't get everything on the
first pass.
EXT--SPACE
[The fleet of jumpers continues to fire drones, pulverizing the
asteroids. Most are destroyed, but a few more slip through.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
TEYLA
Have they destroyed enough asteroids to clear a path?
TECHNICIAN
We're about to find out.
EXT--SPACE
[The jumpers continue to destroy asteroids.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPERS
[The conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's jumpers.]
MCKAY
Well, now what?
SHEPPARD
Well, on my mark, you, Bolton, and Levine are going to break
formation and head back to the city. Take out anything that we
missed.
MCKAY
Oh, that sounds important. Maybe someone else should, uh...
SHEPPARD
Break!
[McKay complies.]
EXT--SPACE
[Three puddle jumpers break off from the group and swing back to
Atlantis, firing drones.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPERS
[The conversation switches between McKay's and Levine's jumpers.]
LEVINE
McKay, you've a big one on your left.
MCKAY
I see it.
LEVINE
Impact in ten seconds!
[McKay powers up his jumper.]
EXT--SPACE
[McKay's jumper speeds toward the city, blasting an asteroid just
before it hits an unshielded building. McKay is so close to the
building himself he can barely pull up to miss the building himself. He
flies vertically up and over the building, sighing in relief.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[A distant explosion is heard.]
TEYLA
What was that?
TECHNICIAN
(hopefully)
Smaller pieces getting through?
[Another explosion rocks the control room.]
TEYLA
Some of them evidently not so small.
[The technician checks his computer read-outs.]
TECHNICIAN
Right now, damage is confined to the outer edge of the city.
TEYLA
Well, let's hope it stays that way.
EXT--SPACE
[The jumpers continue blasting a few more asteroids, then end up flying
into open space.]
INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
All right, we're through. Now, we're gonna double back, pick up any
stragglers.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Teyla and the Technician listen worriedly as more explosions pound the
city. Soon, it stops.]
EXT--SPACE
[Atlantis has passed through the asteroid belt, a large hole appearing
behind them.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[A station beeps. The technician checks its readings.]
TECHNICIAN
That's it. We made it!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[The jumpers land in the bay. Sheppard exits his to meet McKay coming
out of his own jumper, breathing heavily.]
MCKAY
I can't believe that actually worked! That was amazing!
SHEPPARD
You did good, Rodney.
MCKAY
Yeah, so, Zelenka and his team should have the conduits repaired by
now, so...I think we're finally out of the woods!
TECHNICIAN
(over intercom)
Colonel Sheppard? Doctor McKay? Please report to the control room
immediately.
MCKAY
Aw, come on!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay enter from the jumper bay stairwell. Teyla is by a
station where Zelenka sits.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell happened?
TEYLA
The hyperdrive is offline.
SHEPPARD
I thought it was good to go.
ZELENKA
It was, but a few large pieces of rock impacted the city, and one of
the control arrays was damaged. We can't jump until we fix it.
MCKAY
I told you I was no good at Asteroids.
EXT--SPACE
[The city-ship of Atlantis flies through space. The shield still only
covers the central tower area.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, McKay, and Zelenka walk through the corridor.]
MCKAY
The damaged conduits are on the outer edge of the city, which sadly
is outside of the protection of the shield.
ZELENKA
But we can use the transporters to get us very close. But it will
still require a space walk.
SHEPPARD
That shouldn't be too bad.
MCKAY
Heh, it'll be a breeze...with the exception of the micro-asteroids.
SHEPPARD
The what?
MCKAY
Hey, we just came through an asteroid belt. The big stuff's behind
us, but there's still a bunch of, uh, little bullet-sized rocks out
there?
SHEPPARD
Tiny rock bullets. Great.
MCKAY
Huh, I'm sure you'll be fine.
ZELENKA
(petulantly)
Well, then why aren't you going?
MCKAY
Well, because you've already worked out the details of the repair.
You know, it would be a waste of time getting me up to speed.
SHEPPARD
Speaking of time, how much do we have?
MCKAY
Well once you've suited up, uh...fifteen minutes?
SHEPPARD
That's it, huh?
MCKAY
Hey, if the patch job we did on the conduits hadn't slowed down the
power loss? We'd have hit the deadline already.
[They reach the locker where the EVA suits are kept. Sheppard pulls out
one helmet. Zelenka looks nervously at the equipment.]
MCKAY
You can do this.
ZELENKA
(sighing)
Right.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATE ROOM
[McKay heads down a corridor with his tablet computer. He meets up with
Keller as he turns a corner. She appears frantic.]
KELLER
McKay! I've been trying to reach you!
MCKAY
Well, you know, trying to save the city and whatnot. Look, how's
Elizabeth?
KELLER
That's what I want to talk to you about. She's really bad. In fact,
she's so far gone, I don't think there's anything my team and I can
do to heal her.
MCKAY
(reeling)
Oh my god. Uh, are you sure?
KELLER
I've exhausted every medical possibility I can think of, and none of
it's worked.
MCKAY
Sh-she's going to die?
KELLER
Well, I-I do have one more idea, but...I need your help.
MCKAY
Me? What do you need me for?
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Keller shows McKay a display on a laptop.]
KELLER
See those?
MCKAY
What are they?
KELLER
Remember when Doctor Weir was attacked by that Replicator, and he
infected her...?
MCKAY
Nanites! Carson was able to render them inert using an
electro-magnetic pulse.
KELLER
But they're still in her system.
MCKAY
You're a genius.
KELLER
(shrugging with mock humility)
Well, you know, trying to save a life and whatnot.
[McKay acknowledges the callback.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard is in his EVA suit. Zelenka is getting his helmet fitted on.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
You want to what?!
[The conversation switches between the infirmary and the corridor with
Sheppard and Zelenka.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Reactivate Weir's nanites.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
That is a terrible, terrible idea.
MCKAY
What?! I'd reprogram them.
SHEPPARD
No!
MCKAY
John, we are losing her here. Keller and her team have done
everything they can. If I can reprogram the nanites to help repair
her body without taking over her brain, then--
SHEPPARD
Well, that's a big "if", isn't it?
MCKAY
(sighing)
I'm fairly confident I can reprogram them to do only what we want.
SHEPPARD
"Fairly confident?" What if they come back online and start
communicating with the other Replicators? The last thing we need
right now is a bunch of robot warships showing up.
MCKAY
Are you listening? Look, I said I can reprogram them to be
completely harmless.
SHEPPARD
I am not having this conversation until you're sure. I want to save
Elizabeth as much as anyone, but she wouldn't want us risking the
city. Not even for her.
[In the infirmary, Keller and McKay exchange looks. McKay shifts
uncomfortably but nods.]
[In the corridor, Zelenka is now all suited up. He taps Sheppard on the
shoulder to show he's ready. They head into the transporter.]
ZELENKA
That was the right call, by the way.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, let's hope so.
EXT--SPACE, MIDWAY STATION
INT--MIDWAY STATION
[Gravity has been established. Lee enters the control room where Carter
is working.]
LEE
Any word from the Apollo?
CARTER
No, not yet.
LEE
Uh, whatcha workin' on?
CARTER
I'm actually trying to figure out a way to find or contact Atlantis.
LEE
Well, they've obviously veered off-course, right? Like, when was the
last time Atlantis's hyperdrives were used, like a million years
ago? Who knows what that kind of inactivity could've done to them.
CARTER
I think it's more likely that they dropped out of hyperspace too
soon. They were only flying with one ZPM. Maybe McKay underestimated
the power requirements.
LEE
McKay? Ah...
(he shakes his head)
Either way, I know how to find them.
CARTER
Really?
LEE
Yeah. We do an AGB, an All Gates Bulletin. It's like an all points
bulletin, only with Stargates.
CARTER
(scoffing)
Oh, come on.
LEE
No, no, really! We'll create a program, we'll dial all the 'gates in
the Pegasus Galaxy at once, and then we'll try to establish radio
contact with Atlantis.
CARTER
But the Atlantis 'gate is off the grid.
LEE
Right! But if they're close to another gate...
CARTER
Then they would've contacted us by now.
LEE
(deflating)
Yeah. So, uh, so what have you come up with then?
CARTER
Well, nothing yet, but--
LEE
Well, at least I am trying! I-I'm generating ideas here...I--
[Carter gives him an exasperated glare.]
LEE
Sorry.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Zelenka walk carefully through a depressurized corridor
while in their EVA suits.]
ZELENKA
I'm actually surprised. The damage in this area seems to be quite
minimal.
[Sheppard turns a corner.]
SHEPPARD
I beg to differ.
ZELENKA
Oh my.
[Sheppard and Zelenka step into the next corridor. Just beyond the
doorway, the walkway disappears. A whole section of several floors has
been destroyed. The other side still stands, but it is tens of yards
away with only open space between the undamaged sections.]
SHEPPARD
Let me guess. The array is over there.
ZELENKA
I'm afraid so.
SHEPPARD
Great.
[Two bullet-like sounds are heard. Two small holes appear in the wall
near them, created by projectiles passing through.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell was that?
ZELENKA
Micro-asteroid.
SHEPPARD
Mmm. Right...All right. Looks like we're gonna have to jump.
ZELENKA
But I can't jump a hundred feet!
SHEPPARD
We're in space, remember? It's not that far a distance. Look, I'm
going to hook you up with this tether. Okay? Then I'm going to
demagnetize your boots. Then I'm going to throw you.
[While speaking, Sheppard has hooked the tether and demagnetized
Zelenka's boots.]
ZELENKA
Wait! What!? What?!
SHEPPARD
Then I'm going to demag my boots before the tether catches. Your
inertia should pull both of us over the hole and into the hallway.
It'll be a cinch.
ZELENKA
But-but what if you miss?
SHEPPARD
You're just going to have to trust me, Doc...Trust me as far as I
can throw you, actually.
ZELENKA
Very funny.
SHEPPARD
All right, let's do this.
[Sheppard throws Zelenka. The force on the tether pulls Sheppard with
Zelenka and they float across the open space, arriving at the other
side. Zelenka slaps into the wall on the other side. He turns,
breathing heavily in relief.]
ZELENKA
That was...it was unbelievable.
SHEPPARD
Let's get to work.
ZELENKA
All right.
[Zelenka snatches the repair case from where it started to float away.]
INT--INFIRMARY SUPPLY AREA
[Keller enters. McKay works on a computer.]
KELLER
How's it going?
MCKAY
Slowly.
KELLER
Have you found a way to reactivate the nanites safely?
MCKAY
Eh, short story, yes. Long story, no.
KELLER
What?
MCKAY
I'm a hundred percent certain that I can reactivate the nanites and
have them help put Elizabeth back together.
KELLER
Okay...?
MCKAY
Problem is, that they would do it by replacing her damaged cells
with replicated nanites. Which means the moment I tell them to turn
inert again...
KELLER
Those cells would stop functioning, and she'd die.
MCKAY
Yeah. Well, the good news is, I've been able to program them in such
a way that they would never harm her, I-I'm sure of that. Plus I've
shut down their ability to contact the Replicators via subspace, so
both she and we would be safe. But, uh, she'd be part Replicator for
the rest of her life.
KELLER
Yeah, Sheppard's not going to go for that.
[McKay sighs.]
MCKAY
There's a slight possibility I might be able to make them help
repair her organic cells and then shut down when they're done, but,
uh...I need more time.
[He starts typing again.]
KELLER
Okay, well I'll leave you to it then. Good luck.
[She heads out. McKay is already engrossed in his work again.]
MCKAY
(absently)
Mmm. Thanks.
EXT--SPACE, ATLANTIS ARRAY IN DAMAGED CORRIDOR
ZELENKA
I'm sorry. It's taking longer than I expected. These gloves are
making the work so much slower.
[Another micro-asteroid strikes just past Sheppard's shoulder, making a
sound like a bullet impacting and causing a large dent and hole in the
wall behind them. Sheppard and Zelenka both look at the near-miss.]
SHEPPARD
Don't worry about it. We've still got four minutes before the energy
dips too low and we can't make the jump.
ZELENKA
So...no pressure then.
[Another micro-asteroid strikes, this one going through Zelenka's right
leg before impacting the wall. He gasps in pain as blood corpuscles
leak out of his compromised suit.]
SHEPPARD
Radek!
[Sheppard moves to help Zelenka.]
INT--INFIRMARY RECOVERY ROOM
[Ronon enters, wheeling his i.v. pole. Weir lies unconscious on the
bed, hooked up to life support. He leans in close.]
RONON
Um...listen, they uh...they say you can't hear me. But I just-I just
wanted to, um...um...I just wanted to thank you. Thanks for letting
me...stay here a couple of years ago...Because I don't-I don't know
if would still be...um...Thank you, Doctor Weir.
[The monitors start beeping rapidly.]
RONON
Uh...
[He turns around for help. Keller and Marie rush in.]
RONON
(worried)
What did I do?
KELLER
Nothing. It wasn't you, but you need to leave.
[Ronon starts backing out.]
KELLER
(to Marie)
Hang another bag of Manitol.
[The pair work on Weir.]
EXT--SPACE, ATLANTIS ARRAY IN DAMAGED CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
You've been hit by a micro-asteroid. Does it hurt?
ZELENKA
(shakes his head, looking blank)
It doesn't.
SHEPPARD
You're in shock.
[Zelenka looks down.]
ZELENKA
There's a hole in my suit.
SHEPPARD
It's okay. I've dialed up controls to create positive pressure. I'm
calling a jumper. I've got to get you to O.R.
[Zelenka holds up a circuit.]
ZELENKA
We can't leave yet. I have to finish the repairs.
SHEPPARD
Just tell me what to do.
ZELENKA
It's too complicated. I'm almost finished. Please, help me turn
around.
[Sheppard complies.]
INT--INFIRMARY SUPPLY AREA
KELLER
(over radio)
Doctor McKay?
MCKAY
(sighing impatiently)
What is it, Keller?
[The rest of this conversation switches between Keller's location and
McKay's location.]
KELLER
Elizabeth's crashing. If we're gonna do this thing, we need to do it
now.
MCKAY
(stunned)
Wha--I need more time.
KELLER
We don't have more time. I can't keep her blood pressure up, and if
her ICP continues to climb, there's...no bringing her back.
MCKAY
(sighing)
Okay, I'm transferring the program to you now. I'm on my way.
[He types a few commands onto his computer, then hurries out.]
EXT--SPACE, MIDWAY STATION
INT--CONTROL ROOM, MIDWAY STATION
CARTER
You know, the easiest thing to do if they really did fall out of
hyperspace early, is to fly back over the path between M12-578 and
Atlantis.
LEE
Well, that would take over a million years. That's why we have
hyperspace.
CARTER
We could use the Apollo's long-range sensors.
LEE
Eh, those long-range sensors, they don't work in hyperspace.
CARTER
I know. But we could make a little jump, look around, make another
little jump, look around, and...until we find them.
LEE
Yeah, that's good. So, using those sensors, and...conservatively,
we'd have to make...ah, one hundred and eighty thousand little
jumps.
(acting contemplative to hide his criticism)
It'd take a few years.
CARTER
Unless they seriously augment the long-range sensors.
LEE
Oh, yeah. Who's going to do that? It's not like they have an Asgard
on board.
[Carter looks mischievous.]
CARTER
Feel like taking a little trip to the Pegasus Galaxy?
[Lee looks up, surprised.]
EXT--SPACE, ATLANTIS ARRAY IN DAMAGED CORRIDOR
ZELENKA
(breathlessly)
Just some final adjustments.
SHEPPARD
You're doing a great job, Radek. I've called a jumper.
[Zelenka pushes the final circuit crystal in place with an effort.]
ZELENKA
There. I'm done.
[He pushes the array door closed.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Control room, this is Sheppard. As soon as we get inside the shield,
activate the hyperspace jump.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
TEYLA
(into radio)
I'm sorry, John, but we can't.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Why not? Zelenka just finished repairs.
TEYLA
(into comm)
Yes, I know. But we've just dropped below the line. We don't have
enough power.
[She looks at the monitor showing the power level.]
EXT--SPACE, ATLANTIS ARRAY IN DAMAGED CORRIDOR
[Zelenka and Sheppard share looks of dismay.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard watches as medics wheel Zelenka away. He hurries into another
area of the infirmary. Ronon sits on his bed and points towards where
they wheeled Zelenka.]
RONON
Is he going to be okay?
SHEPPARD
I think so. It didn't hit any major arteries.
RONON
Lucky.
SHEPPARD
I wouldn't say that. He's still stuck here just like the rest of us.
RONON
So it's true.
SHEPPARD
We finally fixed the hyperdrive, and now we don't have enough juice
to go anywhere. We've only got twenty-eight hours before the shields
fail.
RONON
All right, so what's the plan?
SHEPPARD
I don't know. I gotta find McKay.
[He turns to go.]
RONON
He's in there.
[Ronon points to the recovery room.]
SHEPPARD
What?
[Sheppard turns just as Keller and McKay leave the room.]
SHEPPARD
Hey!
MCKAY
(nervous)
I heard we didn't get the array fixed in time.
SHEPPARD
What were you doing in there?
MCKAY
Look, she was dying, okay?
SHEPPARD
Rodney?
MCKAY
Look, her heart was weak, her nervous system was fried.
SHEPPARD
What did you do?!
[McKay looks away, exchanging looks with Keller.]
MCKAY
I reactivated the nanites.
SHEPPARD
(furious)
Damn it, McKay!
MCKAY
Look, you were busy! It was life or death! If I didn't act--
SHEPPARD
Yes, she would've died. I know!
MCKAY
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but helping Elizabeth is not
putting us at risk!
SHEPPARD
(furious)
You just reactivated the Replicator nanites!
MCKAY
They're harmless! Look, I am a hundred percent certain they're not
going to try to take her over or-or contact the others!
SHEPPARD
No. No, you can't know that for sure.
MCKAY
(stubbornly)
Yes. Yes, I can.
SHEPPARD
Shut it down.
MCKAY
But...that would kill her.
SHEPPARD
What do you think Elizabeth would want? Do you think she'd want
this?!
MCKAY
Yes, she would. She'd sure as hell do the same for you!
SHEPPARD
Then you obviously didn't know her very well.
MCKAY
Well, maybe not, but you know what, give it some time, you can ask
her herself!
SHEPPARD
NO! It's too dangerous. Shut it down. Right now.
MCKAY
No. No, I'm not going to.
[He crosses his arms and looks obstinate. Sheppard steps forward
menacingly and reaches for his radio.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Meyers, bring an EMP generator to the O.R.
MCKAY
(through gritted teeth)
Oh, would you please just listen to me?
MARIE
(calling from inside the room)
Doctor Keller!
INT--OPERATING RECOVERY ROOM
[Sheppard, McKay, Keller, and Ronon enter the room. Weir sits up in
bed, fully conscious and relieved of everything but an i.v. in her arm.
She pulls off the bandages covering her head. Her hair has fully
regrown to its previous length. She looks around confused.]
WEIR
John...? Rodney...? What's going on?
[They all exchange nervous looks.]
[Later, Keller and Marie wear full hazmat suits as they run radiation
scanners over Weir. She waits patiently, but is frightened.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard watches the progress from a monitor outside the room. McKay
approaches.]
MCKAY
The quarantine is unnecessary.
SHEPPARD
Well, you'll excuse me if I wait for a second opinion.
[Behind them, Ronon approaches, still wheeling his i.v.]
MCKAY
Okay, this is stupid.
SHEPPARD
What is?
MCKAY
Us, fighting.
[As Ronon overhears, he quietly moves away, giving them privacy for
this argument.]
MCKAY
Look, I know you're not happy with me, and you-and you may have some
cause, but anyway, it's not going to matter much if we don't figure
a way out of this, right? Look, we have to work together, so...so,
I-I'm sorry.
[Sheppard finally turns away from the monitor and looks at McKay.]
SHEPPARD
Apology accepted.
MCKAY
All right.
(sighing)
Well, someone should talk to her.
SHEPPARD
(pointing)
Well, Teyla's in there.
MCKAY
All right.
[McKay leaves.]
INT--ATLANTIS RECOVERY ROOM
[Teyla, wearing a hazmat suits, stands in front of Weir. She places her
gloved hand on Weir's bed. Weir places her hand next to Teyla's.]
WEIR
They shouldn't have done this.
TEYLA
(smiling compassionately)
None of us wanted to lose you, Elizabeth.
WEIR
And what happens if the nanites are able to contact the other
Replicators?
TEYLA
Rodney does not believe that is possible.
WEIR
No. It's reckless.
TEYLA
In my opinion...it is well worth the risk.
[Weir frowns, looking ready to cry. She leans close to Teyla.]
WEIR
You have no idea what I went through the last time. Believe
me...this is a very bad idea.
[Teyla does not know how to respond.]
EXT--SPACE
[The city-ship of Atlantis flies through space. The shield covers only
the central tower.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard enters. He finds Zelenka with a crutch, working with the
technician.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell are you doing up here?
ZELENKA
Well, there's not much point sitting in the infirmary waiting to
die, is there?
SHEPPARD
All right...where do we stand?
[Chuck and McKay work on other consoles.]
ZELENKA
Well, we can pretty much forget about subspace communications. The
main control array was almost completely damaged by the beam. I do,
however, have another idea.
[McKay sits up, looking skeptical, but holds his tongue. Sheppard
glances back towards McKay but does not wait for a response.]
SHEPPARD
Let's hear it.
ZELENKA
Well, the reason why we cannot use the power we have left to execute
the short jump to hyperspace is that the city will not let us. It's
a safety protocol, but I might be able to bypass it.
[McKay shakes his head negatively while Zelenka speaks.]
SHEPPARD
And what does that get us?
MCKAY
(caustically)
Not much.
ZELENKA
Well, we wouldn't be able to get to the Apollo, and we wouldn't be
able to get to the nearest Stargate, but...we might be able to find
a habitable planet within range. I have my team running sensor
sweeps right now.
MCKAY
He's conveniently leaving out the reason why those safety protocols
are in place in the first place.
ZELENKA
Yes, well, with insufficient power, there is a...chance that the
city could be ripped apart as we try to enter the hyperspace window.
SHEPPARD
What kind of chance?
ZELENKA
Fifty-fifty.
SHEPPARD
Well, I gotta tell you, Radek, I'm not loving that idea.
[McKay stands and faces them, snapping his fingers in inspiration.]
MCKAY
Experimental jumper. Remember when I was zapped by that machine a
few months ago, and I got, uh...well, even smarter than I normally
am?
SHEPPARD
The one that almost killed you? Yeah.
MCKAY
Well, before I was reset, I was very close to giving one of our
puddle jumpers a hyperdrive.
SHEPPARD
Can you finish it?
MCKAY
Yeah!
(gulping)
Yes, I probably can.
SHEPPARD
All right, great. We-we'll make a jump to the Apollo. Tell them
where we are.
MCKAY
No.
SHEPPARD
Why no?
ZELENKA
The jumper's hyperdrive would be limited. We wouldn't be able to
jump that far.
SHEPPARD
How far then?
[McKay and Zelenka exchange thoughtful looks.]
ZELENKA
What do you think, like, two?
MCKAY
Yeah, two and change, maybe?
ZELENKA
Conservatively, maybe two thousand light years. This is a list of
addresses that are within range.
[He types up commands on his computer. McKay and Sheppard move to
monitor where a map of the region in space appears. Planets with
Stargates appear on the map.]
SHEPPARD
All right, we'll make a bunch of trips and ferry the crew to one of
the planets.
MCKAY
Again, no.
SHEPPARD
Why not?
MCKAY
Well, the drive's never been tested.
ZELENKA
Yeah, we'd be lucky if we get two jumps.
SHEPPARD
Well, we'll make a return trip somewhere.
[McKay studies the map and gets inspired.]
MCKAY
Yeah, ideally, somewhere with a few ZPMs to spare. We come back, we
get Atlantis fully powered.
SHEPPARD
(humoring him)
Yeah, that'd be great.
[Zelenka stares at what McKay noticed.]
ZELENKA
M7R-227.
SHEPPARD
What's that?
ZELENKA
Well...
SHEPPARD
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?
MCKAY
Yeah...yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.
SHEPPARD
And who would that be?
[Zelenka looks nervous.]
MCKAY
That...that would be the Replicator homeworld. You feel up to a
heist?
[Sheppard licks his lips nervously, considering the idea.]
