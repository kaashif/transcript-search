[Excerpts from 1.18 "The Gift", 1.20 "The Siege Part 2" and 2.01 "The
Siege Part 3" are shown.]
TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[A puddle jumper moves deeply under the Atlantis Ocean.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Weir, Sheppard's team, and a science team are all inside the jumper,
looking bored. Teyla moves from the cargo area and approaches McKay,
who's sitting behind Sheppard in the front area.]
TEYLA
Um, "shotgun," is it?
MCKAY
(unhappy)
Aw, come on. Don't know why I have to do this.
[Teyla shoots him an unsympathetic smile as she takes his seat. McKay
moves to the back and sits across from McKay. Zelenka glances at him.]
MCKAY
(annoyed)
What?
ZELENKA
Nobody said anything.
MCKAY
Well, you don't have to, do you? Look, it's not my fault things are
hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.
ZELENKA
Rodney, you said you knew where it was.
MCKAY
I said I knew its last known location. It is a mobile drilling
station, remember? Obviously that's going to take a few hours.
RONON
If we don't find it soon, this is going to be your last known
location.
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Oh, zing.
SHEPPARD
Okay, kids, do I have to pull this thing over? It's hard enough
being in this damn thing for hours without listening to you guys.
GRAYDON
Actually, Dr. McKay has managed to narrow the search field to a
remarkably small area.
MCKAY
(preening)
Mmm. Finally, a voice of reason. Thank you, Doctor, um...
GRAYDON
Graydon.
MCKAY
(absently)
Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.
GRAYDON
(nonplussed)
Uh, I've been here almost eight months.
MCKAY
(surprised)
Really?
GRAYDON
Yeah.
MCKAY
(uncomfortable)
Oh. It's been that long, has it? Time certainly flies.
ZELENKA
Of course, unless you're in a jumper, looking for a needle in a
haystack.
MCKAY
You know what? Shut up.
RONON
You know what? You shut up, McKay.
MCKAY
Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining.
GRAYDON
Uh, it's Graydon, w-with a "D."
MCKAY
What? You sure?
GRAYDON
I-it's--it's my name.
MCKAY
No, no, no, 'cause I could've sworn that the guy I wanted for your
department was called Grayson, because I remember thinking "Dick
Grayson," Bruce Wayne's ward.
GRAYDON
Well, it's Graydon.
MCKAY
Huh. Wonder if that means I hired the wrong guy.
SHEPPARD
(to Weir)
Well. Still glad you came?
WEIR
(drily)
Oh. Sorry. I was preoccupied thinking about the geothermal drilling
platform.
SHEPPARD
It shouldn't take us much longer. We just passed a thermal layer,
and I'm getting some readings a couple of hundred feet ahead.
WEIR
If we did manage to find an alternate and potentially limitless
power supply... well, that would make even this insufferably long
search...seem worthwhile.
SHEPPARD
Okay, kids, we're here.
[He powers up the HUD and the scientists all gather around to stare at
the display.]
SHEPPARD
Well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to power up this
station.
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
[The jumper approaches the drilling platform. Lights automatically
power on as it draws nearer.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WEIR
That wasn't so hard.
SHEPPARD
All I've got to do is dock this thing, and...we can find out what
this place is all about.
INT--HIVE SHIP
[A Wraith queen awakens.]
END OF TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
'EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN'
[The jumper has docked inside a port.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Scientists and engineers are scattered throughout the station. Weir
wanders among them.]
MCKAY
(to Weir)
All systems are online and functioning at full capacity.
WEIR
You mean we're generating power already?
MCKAY
Well, no, but we probably could if we wanted to.
WEIR
No, slow down. The Ancients abandoned this project for a reason.
Let's try to find out what that reason might be before we start
drilling into the planet's crust.
MCKAY
Yes, well, fair enough.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla patrol the station.]
TEYLA
Have we not been down this hallway before?
RONON
Every corridor looks the same.
SHEPPARD
Don't worry, I have an uncanny sense of direction.
RONON
No, I think she's right. We've been down this way before.
SHEPPARD
That's impossible. We took a left, and a left, and then a right.
RONON
Hey, look, all I'm saying is--
[Teyla stops abruptly and gasps.]
RONON
What?
[He and Sheppard turn back.]
TEYLA
I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.
SHEPPARD
Are you sure? We're...pretty deep underwater.
TEYLA
(nervous)
I cannot be certain, but I believe it is onboard the drilling
platform.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
This is Sheppard. Everyone drop what you're doing. Get back to the
control room immediately.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard's team has joined Weir and McKay.]
MCKAY
(patronizing)
We did a complete lifesigns scan. It was the first thing we did when
we stepped aboard this station. Look, I promise you, there is nobody
here but us.
TEYLA
No, Rodney. And I am sensing it even closer now.
MCKAY
Well, maybe it's the pressure. It's been known to do things to the
mind.
SHEPPARD
Just humor me and check again.
[McKay sighs and works the controls. The life signs detector zooms in
on only people in the control room area.]
MCKAY
There. All of these lifesigns have been accounted for. Humored?
WEIR
Wraith don't show up on lifesigns detectors if they're hibernating.
[McKay rolls his eyes.]
TEYLA
I know what I am sensing.
MCKAY
There is no Wraith here, I'm telling you!
RONON
Has your sense ever been wrong?
TEYLA
Never, and I cannot shake this feeling.
RONON
I trust her.
MCKAY
As opposed to irrefutable fact?
RONON
Your machines don't know everything.
MCKAY
I never said that they did.
TEYLA
There is a way for me to be sure. If I can reach out with my mind
and establish a link--
SHEPPARD
Whoa! That's a little reckless, don't you think?
TEYLA
If there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind for me to link
with and therefore no risk. But if there is a Wraith nearby...
WEIR
We need to know.
[Teyla nods.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS
[Teyla sits on a bench in a crew bunk room, meditating. Sheppard, Weir,
and Ronon stand nearby. Bunks are built into alcoves in the walls.]
TEYLA
I'm ready.
SHEPPARD
You sure?
TEYLA
The briefest contact will determine whether or not I'm right.
SHEPPARD
That's all we need, so don't stick around any longer.
WEIR
And we will bring you out of it if at the first sign of trouble.
[Teyla closes her eyes and starts to breathe deeply.]
SHEPPARD
(low, to Ronon)
Just to be sure...
RONON
It's already set to stun.
[Teyla opens her eyes and glares at Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
Sorry.
[Teyla breathes deeply. Her friends watch worriedly. Teyla shifts her
head as if uncomfortable. Her eyes roll back into her head before she
comes out of it and awakens.]
WEIR
Teyla?
[They watch her warily.]
TEYLA
(awkwardly)
I was mistaken. There is nothing there.
SHEPPARD
Well, that's good.
TEYLA
I'm sorry.
SHEPPARD
No reason to be sorry.
TEYLA
Perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this depth.
SHEPPARD
Well, if you've ever seen The Abyss, pressure can make you
nuts...not that I think you're nuts.
TEYLA
It's all right, John. I'm relieved.
WEIR
So am I. Well, we have a lot of exploring to do.
SHEPPARD
We?
WEIR
Until Rodney delivers the preliminary status report, I'm all yours.
Put me to work, Colonel.
SHEPPARD
All right, let's make up some time. Break into teams. Uh, Ronon,
you're with Teyla. Elizabeth, you're with me, or...I'm with you,
however you want to put it.
WEIR
Either way... or "eyether" way...
[Sheppard takes back h is rifle. Ronon returns Teyla's sidearm to her
as they split up.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Weir explore a corridor.]
SHEPPARD
That was weird.
WEIR
(sighing)
Well, we are at the very bottom of the ocean. Maybe you're right,
Teyla's just experiencing the effects of the pressure.
SHEPPARD
Hopefully not as bad as that guy in The Abyss.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Ronon and Teyla stroll down a different corridor.]
RONON
This place is big, huh?
[Teyla does not respond. Instead, she studies everything.]
RONON
What's wrong?
TEYLA
Nothing. Why?
RONON
You just haven't said a word.
TEYLA
Have I not?
RONON
No.
[Teyla stops.]
TEYLA
Has my silence made you...uncomfortable?
RONON
No.
[Teyla approaches with a small smile.]
TEYLA
Your friendship is very important to me... I would hate to do
anything that made you... uncomfortable.
[She clasps him on the shoulder.]
RONON
Okay. Well, I'm good.
[He smiles back at her. Teyla immediately knees him in the groin.]
RONON
Oh!
[Before Ronon can recover, "Teyla" follows through on her attack with
more punches and kicks. Ronon grunts in pain before collapsing to the
ground. "Teyla" continues to kick Ronon. Once he is unconscious, she
looks around. Seeing and hearing nothing, she continues on with
purpose.]
INT--DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM
["Teyla" spots a computer terminal. She starts working the controls.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
[The power shuts down.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney? What's going on?
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[McKay strolls through the room, unconcerned. Power is still on in his
area.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
What do you mean, what's going on?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We just lost the lights.
MCKAY
(into radio)
What?
[McKay moves a scientist out of the way and checks his laptop, attached
to an Ancient terminal.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Huh. You're right.
WEIR
(over radio, sarcastic)
Yes, we can see that.
MCKAY
(into radio)
We just lost power to forty percent of the station. Sensors are
currently off-line. Zelenka, what're you doing?
INT--DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL
[Zelenka studies a terminal with his own computer. He too has power.]
ZELENKA
(into radio)
Uh, what do you mean, what am I doing?
MCKAY
Have you lost power where you are?
ZELENKA
(into radio)
No, have you?
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
No.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We have.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I want to know what's going on.
MCKAY
(over radio)
You know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few
millennia. We're bound to blow a few fuses.
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(continuing into radio)
Look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.
[He starts working on his computer, zeroing in on the affected areas.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Ronon, Teyla, report your position.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
[In another corridor, Ronon lies unconscious.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Ronon? Teyla? Come in.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION
[Weir and Sheppard exchange concerned looks.]
INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL ROOM
[Teyla continues to frantically work the controls.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Ronon? Teyla?
[She ignores the radio.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon and Teyla. Do you know their
position?
INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, ZELENKA'S POSITION
[Zelenka looks up, concerned, as he listens to the radio exchange.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
No, negative. Internal sensors are out, but I have determined the
location where the power went down.
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
It's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION
MCKAY
(over radio)
It's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
We'll meet you there.
[He and Weir rush off.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
Okay.
(to Dickenson)
Davidson.
DICKENSON
(standing)
It's, uh, Dickenson, sir.
MCKAY
(impatiently)
Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here. Look,
get back to the jumper, see if you can use its sensors to determine
the location of our people within the drilling platform.
DICKENSON
Sir.
[Graydon walks by.]
MCKAY
Graydon, you go with him.
[Dickenson and Graydon exchange looks, but comply.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM, ATLANTIS OCEAN
[The Wraith queen swims towards the platform.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[McKay nervously walks down a corridor. He hears a noise and spins
around, only to find Sheppard and Weir there. He sighs in relief.]
MCKAY
There you are.
[The three of them continue down the corridor with their flashlights.]
INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, TEYLA'S LOCATION
["Teyla" stares at the display screen. She pushes a button that opens
an a crystal access area. Unholstering her sidearm, she shoots the
panel, destroying the crystals.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[The gunfire can be heard in the distance.]
WEIR
Weapons fire.
SHEPPARD
Nine mil. This way.
[He and Weir rush in that direction. McKay hangs back, shaking his
head.]
MCKAY
Oh, yes, let's race towards the gunfire.
[He follows.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM ACCESS POOL
[In the center of a room sits a round pool. The Wraith queen emerges
from its depths, breathing deeply and looking around.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Ronon, Teyla, come in.
[Sheppard, Weir, and McKay cautiously patrol the darkened corridor. Off
in a side corridor, Ronon coughs. The trio instantly rush to his side,
helping him sit up.]
WEIR
Are you all right?
RONON
(groaning)
No.
WEIR
Did you see who attacked you?
RONON
Yeah, it was Teyla.
MCKAY
(shocked)
What? W-Why?
WEIR
Okay, until we what's going on, I'd like everyone in one place.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, TEYLA'S POSITION
[She pulls up schematics of the station, studying them.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDORS
[Various corridors, including the one with Dickenson and Graydon, have
force fields activating in various sections.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S TEAM'S POSITION
ZELENKA
(over radio)
This is Zelenka. Someone has just activated emergency force fields
throughout the station.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Can you make it back to the control room?
ZELENKA
(over radio)
Yes, I think so.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Do it.
MCKAY
Well, that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?
SHEPPARD
You and Elizabeth go back to the control room. Ronon and I are going
to check up on Teyla.
WEIR
Be careful.
RONON
No kidding.
[They part ways.]
INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, TEYLA'S POSITION
[Teyla gasps and half collapses onto the terminal. Catching herself,
she looks around the room, confused and panicked. She sees her sidearm
lying on the terminal and grabs it, holding it while looking around in
wonder and trying to catch her breath. Her back is to the door. She
senses something behind her and spins around, her pistol at ready.
Sheppard stands there, pointing his own pistol at her.]
SHEPPARD
Drop it.
[She gasps in shock and drops the pistol.]
TEYLA
(in shock)
John...
[Unable to stand any longer, she collapses onto the terminal.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell's going on?
TEYLA
(bemused)
I do not know.
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and McKay stand by a computer.]
WEIR
Rodney, what's the status?
MCKAY
As far from the "quo" as it gets. Look, Teyla didn't just shut down
several key systems. She scrambled the existing operating codes.
ZELENKA
This is going to take a while.
WEIR
Can we contact Atlantis?
MCKAY
The station's communication system is just gone. I can't even patch
it. She's blown the control crystals, and shut down half the power
to the station, and set up a series of emergency force fields.
WEIR
To what purpose?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
This is Sheppard. We got Teyla.
WEIR
(into radio)
And...?
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla walk down a corridor. Teyla hugs herself
and looks upset. Ronon and Sheppard watch her--both concerned and
wary.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
And nothing. She has no memory of anything that happened in the last
hour. We're on our way to crew quarters.
WEIR
(over radio)
I'll meet you there.
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(to McKay)
Okay, let's forget about restoring this station to its former glory.
Concentrate your efforts on internal sensors and disabling the force
fields that are cutting us off from the jumper.
INT--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS
[Weir joins the trio in the room.]
TEYLA
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.
WEIR
Don't worry about that. How are you feeling now?
TEYLA
I am fine. But to hear of the damage I caused, and yet to have no
memory of my actions...
[She sighs.]
WEIR
Just tell us what you do remember.
TEYLA
I was attempting to seek out the Wraith presence with my mind, and
then...
[She looks confused.]
WEIR
(stunned)
There is a Wraith?
TEYLA
The most powerful mind I have ever encountered. I tried to shut her
out, but--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
Her?
TEYLA
Yes. I believe this Wraith is a queen.
SHEPPARD
(making a face)
I hate queens.
TEYLA
In that brief moment, I sensed...great power--the experiences of
many centuries...hunger. And then...nothing. My next memory is of
Colonel Sheppard and Ronon aiming their weapons towards me.
WEIR
So there is a Wraith aboard the drilling platform.
SHEPPARD
Well, if that were the case, why'd she use Teyla to do all that
damage, and why didn't the lifesigns detector pick up a signal?
RONON
It doesn't matter. If she's here, I'll find her.
SHEPPARD
We'll find her.
TEYLA
I would like to help.
[Weir exchanges looks with the others.]
WEIR
I'm sorry, Teyla, but until we can determine exactly what's--
TEYLA
(interrupting, frustrated)
Yes. Of course. I understand.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR
[Dickenson and Graydon crouch by a panel, opening the crystal bay.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Dickenson. Any progress on disabling those force fields? I'm getting
indications that some of them are going up and down, and we could
really use the jumper's sensors.
DICKENSON
(into radio)
I-I'm doing my best, sir.
GRAYDON
One of these days, I'm just going to call him "Dr. McCoy."
DICKENSON
I'd love to be there for that.
GRAYDON
Well, the next time he calls me Grayson--
DICKENSON
Actually, I know a Grayson.
GRAYDON
There really is a Grayson?
DICKENSON
Yeah, he's a damn good scientist, too. I'm surprised McKay didn't
hire him.
[In the distance, they hear a force field deactivating.]
GRAYDON
Did you do that?
DICKENSON
I don't know, but I'm happy to take credit for it. Check it out.
GRAYDON
Yeah.
[He leaves Dickenson to continue working on the panel and heads down
the hall. Around the corner, he notices puddle of water on the floor.
He continues to the jumper. He sees another puddle on the lowered door.
He looks around, but the corridor is empty. He turns to enter the
jumper, only to come face to face with the hissing queen.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
I don't understand. Wh-what could the Wraith possibly want with an
Ancient drilling platform? For that matter, how did they even get
here?
MCKAY
(annoyed)
I don't know, maybe on a ship nearby.
ZELENKA
Under water?
MCKAY
Look, who knows? Teyla's Spidey sense works for miles. Look, are the
external sensors up and running?
ZELENKA
Yes, they're operational, but they're designed to scan the ocean
floor.
MCKAY
It doesn't matter. Coleman, take a look at the drilling platform's
external sensors. See what you turn up.
COLEMAN
Well, what am I looking for?
MCKAY
Anything.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS
[Weir paces the room while Teyla sits on a bunk. Ronon and Sheppard are
gone.]
WEIR
How are you feeling?
TEYLA
I've never been more ashamed.
WEIR
Oh, you can't blame yourself.
TEYLA
I should have been more careful.
WEIR
A Wraith queen's mind is extremely powerful, Teyla. You know that
better than I do.
TEYLA
Still...if my actions while under her control result in people
getting hurt...
[She shakes her head.]
WEIR
If you hadn't done what you did...who knows what could've happened?
At least now we know what we're dealing with. If anything, I should
thank you. I certainly don't blame you.
TEYLA
I would like to help them find her.
WEIR
Teyla...
TEYLA
There is no risk.
WEIR
I don't know that.
TEYLA
(studying Weir)
Unless you suspect I am still under her control even now?
WEIR
Would I be alone with you if I did?
TEYLA
Then you think I am...somehow vulnerable to her?
WEIR
I think it is best to keep you away from her for the moment, yes.
Look, I don't fully understand this capability you have of linking
with a Wraith mind, but if it's even remotely possible that--
TEYLA
She was only able to control me because I opened my mind to her. If
I choose to do so again, I will be ready.
[Teyla stands.]
WEIR
Teyla, I know you want to help...
TEYLA
I do.
WEIR
The best way for you to do that is allow Ronon and Colonel Sheppard
to find her.
TEYLA
(sighing)
As you wish.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Ronon and Sheppard cautiously head down a corridor, weapons raised.
Sheppard signals with his hand that Ronon should check out a side
corridor while he continues forward.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR, DICKENSON'S POSITION
[Dickenson continues to work on the crystals. He hears movement behind
him.]
DICKENSON
(without turning around)
It's about time. I was beginning to think you had gotten lost.
Listen, did you manage to, uh--
[He turns around to see the queen standing there, snarling at him.
Dickenson, panicked, clambers to his feet and runs down the hall. He
slams into the force field and falls onto his back. Sliding panicked
against the wall, he tries to back away from the queen, who stalks
towards him.]
DICKENSON
Oh God! Oh!
(into radio)
Colonel Sheppard! Oh-- if you can hear me......please--
[The queen chokes Dickenson.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S POSITION
DICKENSON
(over radio)
Help me! Ah--!
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Who am I talking to? What's your location? McKay? Do you have any
men unaccounted for?
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(surprised, into radio)
The two guys I just sent back to the jumper.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Well, I think they're in trouble. Can you get those force fields
down?
[Zelenka sighs, frustrated as the computer beeps. McKay snaps at
Zelenka, frustrated.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
We're working on it.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS
[Teyla paces, holding her head and breathing heavily.]
TEYLA
The Wraith presence is even stronger than before. She is aboard this
station. You must warn them.
WEIR
(into radio)
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla is certain the Wraith is aboard the station.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Understood.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S POSITION
[Sheppard runs down a corridor.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Ronon, I'm heading back to the jumper. Meet me there.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, RONON'S POSITION
RONON
(into radio)
I'm on my way.
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S POSITION
[Sheppard skids to a stop, noticing the force field to the next section
is still activated.]
SHEPPARD
Dammit.
DICKENSON
(over radio)
Sheppard, help me! Please!
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
McKay!
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, RONON'S POSITION
[Ronon runs full tilt into a force field.]
RONON
Ah!
(into radio)
McKay!
MCKAY
(over radio)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, al-almost there.
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
I can only do one at a time.
[A computer monitor reads "system restored."]
INT--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S POSITION
[The force field lowers. Sheppard starts running again.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
The jumper's sensors should be able to locate them.
[Zelenka continues to work.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY
[Sheppard cautiously approaches, P-90 at ready. He spots the water near
the door to the jumper.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard heads in, seeing Graydon sitting in the pilot's chair.]
SHEPPARD
Graydon?
[He turns the chair around. Graydon's corpse is a dehydrated husk.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Graydon's dead. Fed upon.
INT--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS
WEIR
(into radio)
What about Dickenson?
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
There's no sign of him yet. I'll see if we can find him using the,
uh...
INT--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS
[Weir and Teyla exchange worried looks.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Sheppard? Sheppard, come in!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard senses someone behind him. He spins, raising his weapon to
find the queen standing in the back of the jumper. She hisses. He tries
to fire, but her mind control paralyzes him. He groans in resistance,
but cannot stop his hands from dropping his weapon, letting it fall
against his chest, still held by the strap.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You are Sheppard. The one who can fly this ship. You will return me
to the surface. Kneel.
[Resisting, Sheppard is forced to kneel.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Sheppard, this is McKay. What have you got? Sheppard, can you hear
me?
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka and McKay exchange worried looks.]
MCKAY
(into radio, worried)
Is something wrong?
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS
[Weir and Teyla look worried as well.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
WRAITH QUEEN
You will fly me to the Stargate and return me to my people.
[Sheppard shakes, trying to resist. Ronon appears in the doorway,
pistol aimed. Sheppard notices him. The queen sees Sheppard's diverted
attention and spins as Ronon fires. His blast shatters the window to
the jumper, which is immersed in the ocean. Water pours into the
jumper, washing out Sheppard and the queen.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Sheppard awakens in a corridor. He is soaked, and the floor is wet.]
MCKAY
(over radio, panicking)
Sheppard, this is McKay. Please respond! Sheppard, come in.
SHEPPARD
(weakly, into radio)
I'm here.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka sighs in relief.]
ZELENKA
(into radio)
We had to throw the emergency force fields up. The section you were
in was flooding.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[The conversation switches between that location and the control room.]
SHEPPARD
I noticed.
MCKAY
You were thrown by the force of the water clear of the force field
bulkhead.
[Sheppard spots Ronon lying nearby.]
SHEPPARD
Ronon?
[Ronon groans and stands. He walks over to the forcefield and touches
it. The other side of the corridor is completely filled with water.]
RONON
I missed.
SHEPPARD
I noticed that, too.
MCKAY
Everyone else is accounted for. Any sign of Dickenson?
[Sheppard stares down the corridor in concern.]
SHEPPARD
Stand by, McKay.
[The queen lies unconscious further down the corridor.]
MCKAY
Look, I don't know what just happened, but we are now cut off from
the jumper.
[Ronon aims his gun at point blank range from the Wraith queen.]
RONON
I won't miss now.
SHEPPARD
Wait.
RONON
What for?
SHEPPARD
Well, we lost the jumper and we lost communications with Atlantis.
Maybe she can help us get out of this place.
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER
[The queen awakens to find herself strapped down to a gurney with an
i.v. in her arm. Weir, Sheppard, and Ronon stand nearby.]
WEIR
Welcome back. I trust you're comfortable?
SHEPPARD
That groggy sensation you're feeling are the sedatives we're pumping
you full of. Just a precaution. As for the other precautions...
[Ronon sneers as he flourishes his weapon, changing the setting.]
WEIR
Now, you're going to tell us everything we want to know.
WRAITH QUEEN
In exchange for?
WEIR
(firm)
This is not a negotiation.
WRAITH QUEEN
I disagree.
RONON
Let me get this over with.
[Ronon aims his gun. The queen sits up, hissing and pulling against the
restraints. Ronon shoves her back down as Weir backs up. They all take
a moment.]
WEIR
How did you get aboard this station? Are there any more of you?
[The queen hisses. Ronon shifts his position with his gun.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You are all about to die.
WEIR
(drily)
Really?
SHEPPARD
You care to elaborate on that at all?
[The queen sighs and turns away.]
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka walks over to McKay.]
ZELENKA
We should be able to keep the force fields up until Atlantis sends a
rescue jumper, but station communications are still down, so...
MCKAY
I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.
ZELENKA
Don't worry about it, Rodney, it's not your fault.
MCKAY
I'm the one who sent those men back to the jumper.
ZELENKA
Well, the sensors indicated that there was nobody here, so...
COLEMAN
I don't think there was, sir. I think the Wraith arrived here after
we did the initial scans.
MCKAY
What?
COLEMAN
Well, you asked me to do a search with the remote sensors. I found
something. We didn't notice it on the way down because it's
radiating very little E.M.
[She brings up a display on the monitor.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Guys, head back here. I think I have a few answers.
[Later, Sheppard and Weir have joined the others.]
SHEPPARD
A Wraith cruiser?
MCKAY
It seems completely buried in silt.
ZELENKA
Which means it's been here a very, very, very long time.
MCKAY
Yes, give or take a "very."
SHEPPARD
That doesn't explain how she got here.
WEIR
Maybe she swam over.
SHEPPARD
No, no. The pressure at that depth is--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
Is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?
ZELENKA
Yes, it's difficult to imagine, but with a Wraith's ability to heal
itself...
[They exchange worried looks.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Weir brief Teyla.]
TEYLA
And there are no other Wraith on board?
SHEPPARD
No way to know for sure. Our prisoner isn't talking. Other than:
"You're all about to die."
WEIR
Which may or may not be an empty threat.
TEYLA
And you have no way of knowing?
SHEPPARD
Well, she said it with a lot of confidence.
TEYLA
There is a way to find out.
SHEPPARD
We've already been down that road.
WEIR
And what is to stop her asserting control over you again?
TEYLA
She is heavily sedated, and this time, I know exactly what I am
dealing with.
INT--DRILLING STATION CHAMBER
[Weir, Sheppard, and Teyla enter the room where Ronon's been guarding
the queen.]
WRAITH QUEEN
(spotting Teyla)
You...?
TEYLA
I was caught off-guard the first time. That will not happen again.
WRAITH QUEEN
It does not matter.
SHEPPARD
Well, we think it does.
WRAITH QUEEN
Your fate is sealed.
TEYLA
(to Ronon)
If you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not
hesitate to use that.
RONON
I won't.
[Sheppard and Weir exchange concerned looks as Teyla goes into a
meditative state.]
TEYLA
I see her...
FLASHBACK
INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP
[The queen stares from her window as several hives float above the
planet of Atlantis.]
TEYLA
(voiceover)
...leading the first wave of ships that attacked Atlantis during the
war.
END FLASHBACK
TEYLA
(continuing)
Queen of a great alliance. Her ship was damaged during the battle.
It crashed into the ocean.
[The queen hisses and struggles to resist.]
TEYLA
She fed upon her own crew to survive. Too deep to ever swim to the
surface. Waking...between centuries...waiting for rescue that never
came...until finally she was alone.
FLASHBACK
[The queen awakens from hibernation.]
TEYLA
(continuing, voiceover)
She sensed our presence during our descent. She sensed...me. And saw
us as her one chance at freedom from her prison.
[The queen walks down the corridors of her ship, then swims to the
drilling platform.]
END FLASHBACK
TEYLA
The water was...crushing, but she was determined. Finally, after all
these millennia...a ship!
FLASHBACK
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The queen tries to start the puddle jumper.]
TEYLA
(voiceover)
But she did not possess the gene to fly it.
[The queen hisses her frustration.]
'END FLASHBACK
SHEPPARD
She used Dickenson to call for me.
FLASHBACK
INT--HIVE SHIP
[The queen works the controls of her ship.]
END FLASHBACK
[Teyla breathes heavily, half collapsing.]
WEIR
Teyla?
TEYLA/WRAITH QUEEN You are all about to die.</blockquote>
SHEPPARD
That does not sound like Teyla.
TEYLA
You are all about to die! You are all about to die!
[Sheppard and Ronon aim their guns.]
SHEPPARD
Teyla, snap out of it!
TEYLA
Wait!
'FLASHBACK
[An alarm pulses on the hive ship.]
END FLASHBACK
TEYLA
She has activated the self-destruct device of the Wraith cruiser. It
is set to detonate within two hours.
[The queen sighs, looking triumphant.]
SHEPPARD
So...not an empty threat.
[The team exchange worried looks.]
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard and Weir enter.]
MCKAY
How's Teyla?
WEIR
She's resting. I think it took a lot more out of her than she's
willing to admit.
SHEPPARD
What's the news?
MCKAY
Okay, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this section of the
ocean floor because the planet's crust is remarkably thin right
below us, allowing them to drill directly into the magma and
maximize the geothermal power output.
SHEPPARD
Okay.
ZELENKA
Which means there's a great deal of potential energy directly
beneath this station.
SHEPPARD
That's the news? That this place works as advertised?
MCKAY
No, no, the news is that if they were to detonate, say, the
self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just such a wafer-thin crust--
WEIR
(realizing)
Oh my God.
ZELENKA
All that thermal energy directly beneath us will be released all at
once.
SHEPPARD
So...bad news.
MCKAY
Yeah, the initial explosion will be magnified a thousand times.
We're talking catastrophic.
SHEPPARD
So it won't just be us that's affected.
ZELENKA
No, Atlantis will be affected as well. It's well within the blast
radius.
WEIR
And we have no way to warn them?
MCKAY
They'd never even see it coming.
SHEPPARD
So we, uh, disarm the self-destruct.
MCKAY
That's brilliant, but we still need to get there.
WEIR
And how do we do that without the jumper?
SHEPPARD
We're way behind schedule. Uh, they're going to send a rescue jumper
any minute now.
MCKAY
Even if they've left already, I mean, the moment we were overdue...
ZELENKA
Yeah, they won't make it in time.
SHEPPARD
How far is the cruiser?
ZELENKA
Um... Less than a kilometer.
[They look at the display.]
SHEPPARD
She swam that far? What is she?
ZELENKA
A formidable enemy.
MCKAY
(inspired)
I have an idea.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM POOL ROOM
[Sheppard, Weir, and McKay enter. McKay walks over to where some
pressure suits are hanging by the wall.]
MCKAY
I found these in the database when we first got here. They were used
primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.
SHEPPARD
Very cool.
MCKAY
Yeah, you should be able to traverse the distance between here and
the, uh, cruiser.
SHEPPARD
You mean "we."
MCKAY
Uh, yes, of course. We.
[Weir walks over to the pool.]
WEIR
This must be how she got in.
SHEPPARD
Probably. All right, let's get suited up.
MCKAY
Right.
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
[Sheppard and McKay walk from the drilling station to the hive ship in
pressure suits. McKay is hyperventilating inside his suit.]
SHEPPARD
You're breathing too hard.
MCKAY
Forgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being
exerted on this suit right now.
SHEPPARD
Just think of it as a walk on the beach...a beach that's about to
explode.
MCKAY
That's supposed to make me feel better?
SHEPPARD
No, it's supposed to make you walk faster. We're on the clock here.
WEIR
(over radio)
This is Weir. How close are you?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Almost there, but we're running out of time. We may need Teyla to do
her Kreskin act again.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR
[Weir glances over at Teyla.]
WEIR
I'd rather not have to. I think it could be much too dangerous for
her.
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
SHEPPARD
So's exploding magma.
MCKAY
I am walking as fast as I can.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER
[Weir enters. Teyla is already there, staring at the queen.]
WEIR
(desperate, but firm)
How do we disarm the self-destruct? You won't survive the blast any
more than we will.
[The queen sighs.]
TEYLA
I can get the information we need.
WRATH QUEEN
If you were strong enough, you would have done so already. I can
feel how weak you are.
TEYLA
We shall see who is stronger.
[Teyla goes into a meditative trance. The queen sighs, trying to
resist.]
INT--HIVE SHIP
[Sheppard and McKay take off their suits.]
SHEPPARD
That took too long.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, I probably won't be able to disarm the self-destruct in
time anyway, so we're really not in a rush.
SHEPPARD
Why don't we find it first, and then you can be negative?
MCKAY
You know, this ship is remarkably preserved.
SHEPPARD
You'd think after 10,000 years, she'd want to redecorate.
MCKAY
I'm serious. Hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their
main drive.
SHEPPARD
You're saying this thing is salvageable?
MCKAY
Well, I'd have to assess damage to the primary systems, but it's not
completely out of the question. Of course, you'd probably just go
and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all
that work would be for nothing.
SHEPPARD
Tick, tick, tick...
[McKay checks his sensor.]
MCKAY
This way.
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER
[Teyla continues to breathe deeply. Suddenly, she gasps.]
WEIR
Teyla?
[Teyla throws her head back with a cry and clutches her head.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You are weakening.
WEIR
Teyla, I think you should stop.
TEYLA
My concentration slipped for just a moment.
WRAITH QUEEN
And in that moment, I could have crushed you with a single thought.
Perhaps next time, I will.
WEIR
There isn't going to be a next time.
TEYLA
Elizabeth, I am fine.
WEIR
No, you're not. I can see what this is doing to you. Let's just give
McKay a chance.
INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE
[The alarm pulses.]
SHEPPARD
There it is.
MCKAY
Hmm.
SHEPPARD
What?
MCKAY
Well, I'm pretty sure this is the device, and I'm pretty sure it
says we have less than half an hour.
SHEPPARD
So, turn it off.
[McKay tries to work some controls.]
MCKAY
(puzzled)
Hmm.
SHEPPARD
What does that mean?
MCKAY
It's not accepting commands of any kind. There must be some kind of
a-a command code that needs to be entered first.
SHEPPARD
Can you figure it out?
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple, like the number
"one" or the letter "A," like, in Wraith, which would be, um--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
Can you figure out the code or not?
MCKAY
No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years, and we have,
uh, (checking his watch)
...just under a million years less than that.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Elizabeth, you there?
WEIR
(into radio)
Any luck?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Negative. We don't get her command code in less than 30 minutes,
we're dead.
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING STATION CHAMBER
[Still strapped to the gurney, the queen overhears Weir and Teyla
speaking in the hall.]
TEYLA
This is the only way.
WEIR
I told you, Rodney has another idea.
TEYLA
That may or may not succeed. There is only one way to be certain.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
WEIR
She said she would kill you next time.
TEYLA
I will not let that happen.
WEIR
No. We're going to give them more time.
[Weir leaves. Teyla watches her go with a cunning expression, then
turns back to reenter the room where they're holding the queen.]
INT--DRILLING STATION CHAMBER
TEYLA
Ronon. There's been an emergency in the control room. Dr. Weir needs
your help.
RONON
(indicating the queen)
What about her?
[Teyla unholsters her sidearm.]
TEYLA
I will watch the prisoner. Hurry.
RONON
Watch yourself.
[He leaves. Teyla lowers her gun.]
WRAITH QUEEN
Are you fool enough to try again?
TEYLA
I have very little to lose.
[The queen sneers as Teyla goes into a meditative trance. The queen
gasps, trying to resist. Suddenly Teyla gasps and her eyes open. The
queen opens her eyes and watches Teyla. Teyla blankly and turns to the
bindings and undoes the straps holding the queen down. Once free, the
queen raises her feeding arm to strike, then pauses, her eyes
widening.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You are trying to hide something from me.
[Teyla stares in fear and shock at the queen, breathing hard.]
FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir and Sheppard approach Teyla.]
WEIR
There's been a development.
TEYLA
You've been able to disarm the self-destruct device?
SHEPPARD
No, but, uh, Rodney thinks if he can tie in a naquadah generator, he
can still get the Wraith cruiser to fly.
TEYLA
After all these years?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, the damage was superficial. The problem was the engines.
McKay's already restored power, and I think...I can fly the ship to
a safe distance.
TEYLA
That's a suicide mission.
SHEPPARD
Well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland, maybe I can get far
enough away from the explosion. I've got to go now.
TEYLA
Wait! Let me try again. If I can get her to give up her command
code, you won't have to risk it.
SHEPPARD
You're in no condition to do that. Sorry.
[He leaves.]
END FLASHBACK
[The queen smiles, releasing her mental hold on Teyla, who faints. The
queen strides down the hall]
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
[The queen swims from the drilling platform back to her ship.]
INT--HIVE SHIP
[Sheppard stands by the self-destruct console. Hearing something behind
him, he turns. The queen stalks towards him.]
SHEPPARD
Well. You're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you that.
[He backs away from the self-destruct nervously as the queen
approaches.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You have restored power?
SHEPPARD
(casually)
It'll fly.
[The queen reaches the controls and types in the code for the
self-destruct abort. It shuts down.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You shall be rewarded...with a quick death!
[She is shot from behind by McKay, who fires his P-90 at the automatic
setting. The queen stays standing and turns, stalking angrily towards
McKay.]
MCKAY
(panicking)
She's not dying according to plan here!
[He starts to get away. Sheppard pulls his hidden pistol out and shoots
the queen in the back several times. She finally falls.]
SHEPPARD
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
MCKAY
Of course not. I just had to wait for her to disable the device.
Hey, just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the
command code.
SHEPPARD
Oh, that's why you didn't want to be bait.
MCKAY
No, no, no, no, you had to be bait, because she was expecting you to
be the one trying to fly the ship.
[Sheppard seems to consider this logic while McKay nervously studies
the queen.]
MCKAY
She is dead, right?
SHEPPARD
Let's get out of here.
EXT--DRILLING PLATFORM
INT--DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS
[Teyla and Weir sit on a bunk. Sheppard heads to a different one and
sits down.]
SHEPPARD
How are you feeling?
TEYLA
Oh, much better, now that I no longer feel the constant presence of
a Wraith.
SHEPPARD
That was no ordinary Wraith. It took a lot of bullets to take her
down.
RONON
I wish I was there.
[Ronon unbuckles his gun holster and gets into another bunk.]
WEIR
He's right, you know. I mean, deceiving a Wraith queen? That's no
small feat.
TEYLA
(humble)
Well, when there are so many lives at stake, it's easy to summon the
strength.
[McKay enters.]
MCKAY
(pleased)
Well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up. Turns out
Atlantis had sent another jumper. It should be here within the hour.
WEIR
That's good news.
MCKAY
Hmm.
RONON
Yeah, no kidding. I can't wait to see the sun.
[He settles face down on his bunk.]
MCKAY
What? No, no, no. We haven't finished what we came here for. Look,
Wraith's gone. We've got a ton of research to do.
[Weir grabs her jacket and stands.]
WEIR
Yes, we do.
MCKAY
In fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to
get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.
[He and Weir leave, Weir throwing a sidelong glance back at Teyla, who
smiles.]
RONON
Is he serious?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, he is.
TEYLA
Well, I for one intend to spend the next little while...resting.
[She fluffs a pillow.]
RONON
Same here.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Same here. Oh...
[Sheppard lies down.]
FADE OUT
