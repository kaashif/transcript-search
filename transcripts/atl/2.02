EXT--DAEDALUS IN HYPERSPACE
INT--DAEDALUS MESS
[Weir is sitting alone in the mess, drinking a cup of something and
watching the blue light of hyperspace through the window. Sheppard
enters, checking his watch.]
WEIR
Hey, what are you doing up so late?
SHEPPARD
(pouring himself a cup of coffee)
Couldn't sleep. Must be the burden of command.
[He takes a seat across from her.]
SHEPPARD
You know, ever since I was promoted to lieutenant colonel?
WEIR
All right, John, it's been almost a month. When are you going to
stop trying to find a way to bring that up in every single
conversation?
SHEPPARD
You've got to understand. There's a lot of people in the air force
who never thought I'd make it past captain.
WEIR
Well, obviously, the people whose opinions matter the most thought
otherwise.
[Weir leans back in her chair and smiles jokingly.]
SHEPPARD
What about you? What are you still doing up?
WEIR
Mm, I think I got used to falling asleep to the sound of the ocean.
SHEPPARD
Well, McKay says we're already at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy.
You'll be fine once we get back to Atlantis. You know, it's funny. I
spent the past year wondering if I'd ever see Earth again, and as
soon as I got there...
WEIR
I know how you feel. God, it was extremely convenient to be able to
step through the gate and be at Stargate Command in an instant, and
now this... It feels extremely inconvenient having to spend 18 days
cooped up on this ship to get back.
SHEPPARD
Until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate, that's just the
way it's going to have to be.
[An airman runs into the room.]
AIRMAN
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sheppard, there's been an accident.
[Weir and Sheppard follow the airman out.]
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM
[In a room housing a variety of control panels and monitors, Beckett is
crouching over a man lying on the floor, feeling for a pulse. There are
several crewmen standing behind him, looking on. Sheppard and Weir
arrive on the scene.]
WEIR
That's Dr. Monroe! What happened?
BECKETT
I don't know... but he's dead.
[Weir and Sheppard exchange concerned looks.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM
[Beckett and another man are zipping the body of Monroe into a body
bag.]
BECKETT
All right, one, two, three.
[Beckett and two crewmen lift the body bag onto a gurney.]
BECKETT
Carry on.
[Caldwell enters the room]
CALDWELL
How did he die?
BECKETT
I'm not a hundred percent certain. But there are burn marks on his
fingertips.
[The crewmen wheel the gurney from the room.]
SHEPPARD
Obviously there was a short.
[Sheppard indicates the door control panel on the wall, which shows
obvious signs of damage.]
SHEPPARD
Panels are open, circuits are charred.
CALDWELL
There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill anyone. Doctor?
BECKETT
I'll know more once I've had a chance to examine the body more
thoroughly.
[Beckett leaves the room. Weir addresses McKay, who is sitting at a
console working on the computer.]
WEIR
Do you know what was he was working on?
MCKAY
Computer diagnostics, strictly routine. I've got security camera
footage.
[McKay activates the monitor in front of them and he, Caldwell, Weir
and Sheppard watch the footage. It shows Monroe working at the console
until the picture is replaced with interference.]
WEIR
What happened there?
MCKAY
I don't know. It's a camera malfunction.
SHEPPARD
Right before he was killed? Interesting coincidence.
MCKAY
Actually, I think it makes sense. Look, Colonel Caldwell was right.
There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill someone, at least
not normally.
WEIR
What are you thinking?
MCKAY
It's possible there was some sort of isolated power surge in this
section. That would explain the lost camera, the malfunctioning
door.
CALDWELL
So when the door controls didn't respond, he took out the panel to
bypass the circuits and received a fatal jolt?
MCKAY
Well, like I said, it's possible. Look, I recommend we drop out of
hyperspace, run a full diagnostic on the power distribution systems.
CALDWELL
No, we drop out now, we risk being detected.
MCKAY
That's true. I just think that if we...
CALDWELL
We'll be back in Atlantis in less than two days. You can do your
diagnostic then.
[McKay is clearly frustrated.]
WEIR
Colonel, are you sure that's wise?
CALDWELL
With all due respect, Doctor, you got back to Earth through the
Stargate. This is my third trip on the Daedalus between galaxies.
WEIR
I understand that, but this ship is relatively new. There might be
some problems...
CALDWELL
Doctor. A word, please.
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Caldwell and Weir are walking away from the room.]
CALDWELL
I know the chain of command can get a little fuzzy on Atlantis, but
that's not going to happen here. You got a problem with my orders...
You take it to me in private. Otherwise, keep your opinions to
yourself.
WEIR
Are you sure that's what this is all about?
CALDWELL
I've got a job to do, Doctor.
WEIR
But not the one you wanted.
FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry, Weir, Caldwell and several other personnel are seated around
the conference table.]
LANDRY
We understand the international committee has approved a significant
increase in personnel and resources for the Atlantis mission.
WEIR
Now that we have a ZPM, the city can support a much larger
contingent.
CALDWELL
Of course, it's our feeling that a correspondent increase in
military presence would also be prudent.
WEIR
I agree. That's why I wanted Major Sheppard to come back with me. In
fact, I brought all my senior staff back. I think it's only fair
that they participate in the selection process of the new personnel
in their respective departments.
[Landry gets up from the table and crosses the room.]
LANDRY
That's kind of what we wanted to talk to you about. In your report,
you singled Major Sheppard out for a lot of credit.
WEIR
That's right.
LANDRY
(pouring himself a cup of coffee)
You were also candid enough to document several occasions in which
you and the major didn't exactly see eye to eye. In particular,
there was an incident involving an alien nanovirus in which Major
Sheppard directly disobeyed one of your orders.
WEIR
He also saved a lot of lives that day.
LANDRY
Well... the Major's courage and ingenuity are not in question here.
His ability to follow the proper chain of command is.
[Landry walks around the table to a position directly opposite Weir and
directly behind Caldwell.]
WEIR
I'm not military, General.
CALDWELL
But you are the leader of the expedition.
LANDRY
You see, Doctor, from our point of view, Major Sheppard's
independent nature poses a bit of a problem. If he can disobey you,
he may see fit to do the same to the new commander of the military
contingent on Atlantis.
WEIR
(coldly)
Excuse me? And when did this happen?
LANDRY
Of course, the decision hasn't been made yet, but we do have a
candidate in mind.
[Weir lets out a breath and looks at Caldwell, who gives a small nod.]
WEIR
(firmly)
Atlantis has a military commander.
LANDRY
You had a military commander. Colonel Sumner. When he was killed,
Major Sheppard correctly assumed the position until a proper
replacement could be brought in.
CALDWELL
Doctor, you can't be suggesting that a mission of this importance be
trusted to a major. And one with a questionable record, at that.
WEIR
(to Landry)
Major Sheppard's record before he joined my team doesn't concern me.
All I can tell you is that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be
sitting here right now. And as for his rank...
(Caldwell smiles incredulously)
Well, if that's not good enough for you, you're just going to have
to promote him.
LANDRY
Doctor...
WEIR
I shouldn't have to remind you gentlemen that I continue to have the
support of the president and our foreign allies. You don't want to
fight me on this one.

INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Caldwell is talking with a crewman as McKay enters through a door.]
CALDWELL
(to crewman)
All right. Thank you.
MCKAY
Colonel Caldwell.
CALDWELL
What is it, Doctor?
[Caldwell starts to walk away. McKay catches up and walks with him.]
MCKAY
I realize you've already made it clear that you're not big on the
whole dropping-out-of-hyperspace thing, which I understand, given
that we would emerge in an uncharted section of the Pegasus galaxy
with who knows what waiting for us around the corner...
CALDWELL
Doctor?
MCKAY
Look, I think it's possible... that Dr. Monroe's death might not
have been an accident.
[Caldwell stops walking and turns to face McKay.]
CALDWELL
What are you talking about?
MCKAY
I checked the power distribution logs against the time-code on the
security camera. There was an unexplained spike, but it happened a
full thirty seconds after the camera went out.
CALDWELL
So?
MCKAY
So that means the malfunction in the door and the camera were not
caused by the same problem. Major Sheppard was right. That's too
much of a coincidence.
CALDWELL
You mean Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.
MCKAY
Right.
(to himself)
That's going to take some getting used to.
CALDWELL
Is that the only evidence you have?
MCKAY
No, there's something else. It's looks like Dr. Monroe was in the
process of enabling certain computer security protocols. They're
designed to isolate and shut down corrupted programs.
CALDWELL
What programs?
MCKAY
I don't know. That's just it. He was killed before he could finish.
CALDWELL
You're telling me there's a problem with the ship, and someone
killed Monroe to cover it up?
MCKAY
I know this sounds crazy, but there is definitely more going on here
than random malfunctions.
CALDWELL
(into radio)
Bridge, this is Caldwell. Drop us out of hyperspace immediately.
[McKay looks slightly smug.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Daedalus drops out of hyperspace.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[McKay and numerous personnel are at various consoles.]
HERMIOD
If I may be so bold, what exactly are we looking for?
MCKAY
Any indication that someone's been tampering with the ship's
computers.
HERMIOD
Perhaps you could be more specific.
MCKAY
Not really, no.
[Hermiod sighs.]
MCKAY
What was that?
HERMIOD
Nothing.
MCKAY
Look, just check the major systems. Propulsion, navigation, life
support. Look for anything out of the ordinary. Lindstrom and I will
check power distribution, see if we can figure out what caused the
power spike.
[Sheppard enters the room, staring uncomfortably at Hermiod.]
SHEPPARD
How's it coming, Rodney?
MCKAY
It's going to take a while.
(whispers)
Don't stare. He hates it when people stare.
SHEPPARD
(whispers)
Am I the only one who thinks it's strange we're working with an
alien?
MCKAY
(whispers)
Intergalactic hyperdrive technology is kind of new to us, so we need
his help.
SHEPPARD
(whispers)
Is he supposed to be naked like that?
MCKAY
Lindstrom?
[McKay and Sheppard walk away.]
[Hermiod mutters unintelligibly.]
INT--DAEDALUS POWER ROOM
[McKay and Lindstrom enter the room.]
MCKAY
Okay, let's speed this up. You take the logs, and I am going to take
a look at the... junction box.
[McKay opens the junction box and starts working in it. Lindstrom is at
another console, punching keys.]
MCKAY
I've got nothing. You?
LINDSTROM
Uh, give me a second... Wait a minute!
MCKAY
What?
LINDSTROM
I think I got something here.
MCKAY
Well, what?
[Rapid beeping, lights flashing, McKay ducks out of the way of a
coolant blast from the ceiling.]
LINDSTROM
It's a coolant leak! Let's get the hell out of here!
[McKay gets to the door but Lindstrom is hit by the coolant blast. He
screams and runs the other way, clutching his arm.]
MCKAY
Lindstrom! Lindstrom!
[Both men leave the power room by opposite doors, McKay into the
corridor and Lindstrom into an airlock, closing the doors after
themselves.]
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[Lindstrom coughing.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[McKay coughing.]
MCKAY
(into wall-mounted video communicator)
Lindstrom!
[Video screen shows Lindstrom in the airlock, coughing up liquid.]
MCKAY
Lindstrom! You all right?
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[Lindstrom coughing.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[McKay is watching Lindstrom through the video communicator.]
LINDSTROM
Yeah, I'm okay. What happened?
MCKAY
I don't know. Just sit tight. We're going to need to shut down the
leak and vent the room.
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[Lindstrom is inspecting his hand, which is covered in white residue.
Static is heard over the communicator. Lindstrom attempts to
re-establish the link.]
LINDSTROM
Rodney?
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
MCKAY
Lindstrom!
[The video screen shows Lindstrom shrugging. He is speaking but there
is no sound.]
MCKAY
Lindstrom, are you reading me?
[McKay picks up a handset and speaks through it.]
MCKAY
Lindstrom, are you reading me?
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[A warning siren blares and lights on either side of the airlock door
start flashing.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
MCKAY
What the hell are you doing?!
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[Lindstrom presses buttons on the control panel, to no avail.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
MCKAY
The airlock's opening! Override the system!
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
LINDSTROM
Rodney, help me!

screen, but there is still no sound.]
MCKAY
(frantic)
Lindstrom!
INT--DAEDALUS AIRLOCK
[The airlock begins to open.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[The video communicator screen shows the airlock open and Lindstrom get
sucked out into space.]
MCKAY
(horrified)
Oh my God.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[We fade in with the focus on a security camera mounted on the ceiling.
Below, Beckett is inspecting McKay as Caldwell, Sheppard and Weir look
on. There are a number of other personnel around. McKay removes the
oxygen mask he had been holding to his face.]
MCKAY
I already told you, I'm fine.
BECKETT
He's right. It appears he didn't inhale enough toxins to cause any
permanent damage, although a few more seconds of exposure and it
would have been quite a different story.
[Beckett lifts McKay's hand holding the oxygen mask back to his face.]
CALDWELL
Thank you, Doctor.
[As Beckett walks away, McKay again removes the oxygen mask from his
face.]
CALDWELL
I assume this time we can definitely rule out random malfunctions.
MCKAY
Lindstrom found something. He was trying to tell me what it was when
the leak happened.
WEIR
What were you looking for?
MCKAY
We were trying to trace the source of the power spike that killed
Dr. Monroe.
CALDWELL
Who else knew what you were doing?
MCKAY
A lot of people knew we were running diagnostics, but no one knew we
were in that particular room at that exact moment.
SHEPPARD
Security cameras. If the person who killed Monroe was able to get
into the system to erase evidence, there's no reason he couldn't do
the same thing to keep tabs on the investigation.
MCKAY
Assuming it's a he.
CALDWELL
How many personnel onboard have the technical skills to do something
like this?
MCKAY
Almost everybody. That's what you get for assembling a team of
brilliant scientists.
WEIR
I can't believe it would be one of our own people. Isn't it possible
there's an intruder onboard?
CALDWELL
We used the life-signs detector to do a head count. We didn't get
any extra signals.
WEIR
Well, a hibernating Wraith, they can avoid detection.
SHEPPARD
We've seen that tactic before. Beam in, lay low, then look for the
chance to conduct sabotage.
CALDWELL
That was on Atlantis. It's been at least two months since this ship
encountered the Wraith. There's no way one of them could have stowed
onboard that long.
MCKAY
He's right. They did a full decontamination sweep back on Earth.
They would've found something.
CALDWELL
All right, then.
(to an airman behind him)
As of this moment, I want all civilian personnel confined to their
quarters.
WEIR
(incredulous)
What?
CALDWELL
Present company excepted, of course.
MCKAY
Uh, Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people could be
extremely helpful in the investigation.
CALDWELL
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I can't trust any of them for the simple
reason that I didn't have any say in their selection. Somebody else
was in charge of that process.
[It is clear from the expression on Weir's face that Caldwell is
referring to her.]
FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Beckett, Weir and several other people are sitting around the
conference table, which is piled with personnel files.]
BECKETT
Look at this. Four years relief work in the Sudan and Ethiopia.
Graduate studies at Johns Hopkins and Harvard. Half a dozen research
grants. Oh, and she also enjoys judo, horseback riding, origami, and
something called base-jumping.
WEIR
Parachuting from cliffs and tall buildings.
BECKETT
Oh. Of course.
WEIR
You said you wanted the best.
BECKETT
But all these people are more qualified than I am. How am I supposed
to choose between them?
WEIR
Carson, you're my chief surgeon. No one is more qualified than you.
BECKETT
Well I've managed to make a short list.
(handing Weir a piece of paper)
I was hoping you'd make the final selections.
WEIR
This is your short list?
[Weir sighs and looks over the sheet.]
WEIR
Did you review the file Of a Dr. Simon Wallace?
BECKETT
Aye. He was also more qualified than I am.
WEIR
Why isn't he on the list?
BECKETT
All the candidates were required to sign off on a blind commitment
to a one year term.
WEIR
(confused)
Dr. Wallace has been given security clearance. He knows what this is
all about.
BECKETT
Maybe that's the problem.
WEIR
What do you mean?
BECKETT
He hasn't signed.
[Weir looks upset.]
EXT--WEIR'S HOUSE, DAY
INT--WEIR'S HOUSE
[Weir is standing in the kitchen while Simon Wallace is cooking.]
WEIR
(almost shouting)
When were you going to tell me?
SIMON
There's nothing to tell. I mean, I haven't said "yes", but I haven't
said "no" either.
WEIR
(agitated)
You do realize that you are not going to make the final list of
candidates unless you commit.
SIMON
Elizabeth, you know you can't just come back after a year and expect
me to drop everything on two weeks' notice. I have responsibilities
here. I have patients. I have research.
WEIR
I know, I know, and I would never diminish the importance of your
work. But you have to understand that every single person on this
entire expedition is in the exact same situation. I mean, in fact,
it's why they were chosen in the first place.
SIMON
I understand. I... I just need a little more time.
[Simon continues cooking as Weir watches him, frustrated.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Hermiod is standing at his console. McKay enters.]
HERMIOD
Dr. McKay, you are just in time.
MCKAY
For what? What are you looking at?
HERMIOD
The sabotage we've been searching for.
[The monitor in front of them shows binary code streaming across the
screen.]
MCKAY
It's a virus?
HERMIOD
(sarcastically)
How perceptive of you.
MCKAY
Where did you find it?
HERMIOD
One of the navigational computers. There is evidence of it in
communications and some of the propulsion systems as well.
MCKAY
So it's spreading?
HERMIOD
Yes, and changing.
MCKAY
What do you mean?
HERMIOD
It appears to be re-writing itself as it grows. It is unlike any
human engineered program I have ever encountered.
MCKAY
Yeah...
[McKay walks towards a console, shooing the airman working there out of
the way.]
MCKAY
Airperson... don't be there.
HERMIOD
What are you doing?
MCKAY
(punching keys)
Just checking something. I'm sure it is impossible.
[The monitor shows binary code being translated into another script.]
MCKAY
Crap.
HERMIOD
What did you do?
MCKAY
I just ran it through a translation program. It's Wraith.
HERMIOD
Crap, indeed.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Weir, McKay, Sheppard and Caldwell are looking the code on monitors.]
WEIR
A Wraith computer virus?
MCKAY
It was probably downloaded during our last little encounter.
CALDWELL
Well, if it's been there all this time, why are we just noticing it
now?
MCKAY
Well, in all likelihood, it was transmitted in a compressed format.
It took a while to unfold, to spread to the point where it could
adversely affect our systems. I think it probably happened during
your return flight to Earth. Since then, it's been dormant, waiting
for some kind of a trigger.
SHEPPARD
Like what?
MCKAY
Possibly the fact that we're once again in proximity to Wraith
territory. I think it was ultimately designed to take control of the
navigational system. Fly the ship right to them.
WEIR
If they get their hands on the Daedalus, they'll not only have
access to the intergalactic hyperdrive technology, but they'll have
all the navigational data that'll lead them straight to Earth.
MCKAY
It's what they've wanted all along. A new feeding ground.
CALDWELL
This still doesn't explain who killed Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom.
MCKAY
That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus.
[Sheppard and Caldwell look at McKay questioningly.]
MCKAY
Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence. It can think for
itself, adapt itself to new situations...
SHEPPARD
Protect itself.
MCKAY
Exactly. It knew that Lindstrom and Monroe were going to expose it,
so it got rid of them.
WEIR
Can it take over the whole ship?
MCKAY
Well, not entirely. You have to remember that there are hundreds of
individual computers onboard. A lot of them are interconnected, so
we tend to think of them as one big machine, but that's not really
the case. There are dozens of backups and redundancies and some
systems, like life support, are deliberately isolated.
SHEPPARD
So they can't kill us all by venting the atmosphere.
MCKAY
That was the good news. The bad news is some of the more complex
systems, like navigation and propulsion, require a certain amount of
inter-connectivity to function properly. In all likelihood, the
virus has spread so far through those systems, that to isolate it
would make the ship impossible to fly. Until we figure out a way to
get rid of it, we're stuck here.
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
Colonel Caldwell. Sir, we just began broadcasting a distress call.
CALDWELL
What are you talking about?
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
It just came on by itself, Sir.
CALDWELL
Shut it down.
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
I'm locked out Sir.
MCKAY
It's the virus. This is what I mean by "adapting itself to new
situations." It doesn't have enough control yet to fly us to the
Wraith so, instead, it's calling the Wraith to us. And right now, we
are sitting ducks.
[Sheppard looks towards the window.]
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell is looking at the monitor over Cooper's shoulder. When he
goes to take his seat, Sheppard approaches McKay.]
SHEPPARD
What are you doing?
MCKAY
Theoretically, we should be able to cut power to the long-range
transmitter. It won't be able to send messages, but neither will the
virus.
SHEPPARD
Theoretically.
MCKAY
Well, it's pretty smart. So far, everything we've tried, it's been
one step ahead of us.
(to the Bridge Lieutenant)
Try it now.
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
It's no good, Sir. We're still broadcasting.
MCKAY
All right, that leaves us one choice. We need to do a full system
shutdown. We'll wipe everything, reboot, load clean backups.
WEIR
Will that really work?
MCKAY
Absolutely... I think.
CALDWELL
How long will it take?
MCKAY
Well, it's not like the ship's got an on/off button. We'll need some
time to prepare, say an hour, maybe two.
SHEPPARD
Every minute we wait we increase our chances of being detected. We
need to turn off the transmitter array now.
CALDWELL
Do you have an idea?
SHEPPARD
As a matter of fact, I do, but you're not going to like it.

speed.
EXT--F-302 IN SPACE
[The F-302 flies away at speed.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
MCKAY
I should've seen this coming. The navigational software on the F-302
is compatible with our sub-light systems, which would be infected.
The virus must've uploaded itself onto his ship.
WEIR
What about the transport beam?
MCKAY
That would work. Those systems are still clean.
CALDWELL
Do it.
WEIR
(into radio)
John, this is Elizabeth.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
WEIR

Rodney seems to think the virus has taken over your ship, so we're
going to try to beam you out.
SHEPPARD
Acknowledged.

WEIR
Stand by.

[Sheppard detaches the oxygen mask from his helmet.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
MCKAY
Ah. Slight problem.
WEIR
What?
MCKAY
The transport beam is tied to an Asgard sensor. It's what we use to
lock on to targets.
WEIR
So?
MCKAY
So that particular piece of equipment was located in the array that
we just destroyed.
[Caldwell rolls his eyes.]
MCKAY
(clicking his fingers)
I can key the system to lock on to his radio signal. That's what
they used to do on the Prometheus before they had Asgard sensors.
CALDWELL
Well, you'd better do it quick, because in about three minutes, he's
going to be out of range.
[McKay starts working on the console.]

[Sheppard is sitting in the living room of a comfortable suburban home,
looking at a photograph of Ford in his dress uniform. Ford's cousin,
Lara, enters, carrying a tea tray.]
LARA
(putting the tray on the table and taking a seat)
Here we go.
SHEPPARD
Thanks.
LARA
(pouring tea)
I appreciate you coming here in person, Colonel. Aiden and I were
only cousins, but since he didn't have any brothers or sisters, we
became very close.
SHEPPARD
I want you to understand, as far as I'm concerned, he's still alive.
Until I see evidence to the contrary, I intend to keep looking for
him.
LARA
But you can't give me any details. You can't tell me where he was
stationed or how he went missing or what the chances are that I'll
ever see him again.
SHEPPARD
I'm sorry.
LARA
This is exactly why I didn't want you to speak With Aiden's
grandparents. They can't take this kind of thing right now. I'm
starting to think that maybe I should just tell them that he's not
coming home. At least then they would have some closure.
SHEPPARD
We're not there yet.
LARA
You know, Aiden mentioned you in that taped message he sent. He said
you were a good man. That he trusted you with his life. You tell me,
Colonel. Was that trust misplaced?
[Sheppard doesn't respond.]
WEIR AND LARA
(voices)
Colonel?
END FLASHBACK
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
WEIR AND LARA
(voices)
Colonel?
WEIR
(over radio)
John, are you still there?
SHEPPARD
Go ahead.
WEIR
(over radio)
We're going to use your radio to target the transport beam. We'll
have you out of there in just a minute.
SHEPPARD
Sounds good. So I'm still in range, right?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
MCKAY
(covering his radio mouthpiece)
The truth is it's never been tested from this distance.
WEIR
(into radio)
Rodney seems to think you'll be okay.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
Well, that's good. I wouldn't want to leave any parts behind.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
MCKAY
We're ready. I'm beaming him directly to the bridge.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[A bright white flash and Sheppard is no longer in the cockpit.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell, Weir and McKay watch anxiously, waiting for Sheppard to
appear. He beams in, in a bright white flash.]
WEIR
(relieved)
Are you all right?
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Two arms, 10 fingers... I'll check the rest later.
CALDWELL
(to McKay)
All right, Doctor, I've had enough of this. I'd like to have my ship
back, please.
MCKAY
Right.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[We zoom in on a security camera mounted on the wall. The perspective
switches so we are seeing the scene through the security camera. McKay
and several other personnel are working at consoles while Weir and
Sheppard look on.]
MCKAY
(nudging an airman out of the way)
Move.
[Perspective switches back so we are in the scene again.]
MCKAY
(nearly bumping into Sheppard)
Do you mind?
SHEPPARD
This is what I do when I have problems with my laptop. I turn it
off, and then I turn it on again.
WEIR
I think this is a little bit more complicated than that.
SHEPPARD
I'm just saying that if we're taking a page from the John Sheppard
book of computer repair, we're really desperate.
MCKAY
(into radio)
All right, Colonel, we're ready.
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Thank you.
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[We see the scene through a security camera.]
CALDWELL
(over public address system)
All personnel. This is Colonel Caldwell. Prepare for a full system
shutdown.
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #1
[We see the scene through a security camera. There are several people
in the room.]
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #2
[There are two people listening to the announcement.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(into radio)
All right, Doctor. Go ahead.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
MCKAY
And...
[McKay gives Hermiod a signal and he operates the console.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The lights go out as the system powers down.]
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #1
[The lights go out as the system powers down.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Weir is plunged into darkness as the lights go out.]
FLASHBACK
INT--WEIR'S HOUSE
[A hand strikes a match and lights a candle. We pan out to see that
it's Weir. Simon enters the room.]
SIMON
What's all this?
WEIR
Well, I figured we won't have many more chances for a really good
dinner. I mean, the food on Atlantis, it's all right, and some of
the Athosian dishes are fantastic, but...
SIMON
Elizabeth...
(shaking his head sadly)
I'm not going.
[Weir turns her back to regain her composure, then turns to face him.]
WEIR
I don't understand.
SIMON
You're the adventurer, not me.
WEIR
But I'm not. I mean, at least I wasn't... not before. Look, the
first time I stepped through that gate, I was terrified. I knew I
wasn't prepared for what I was getting into, but I took a chance.
SIMON
I know. And I'm proud of you for that.
WEIR
Simon, we...
SIMON
There's something else.
[Weir looks at him questioningly.]
SIMON
I met someone.
[Weir takes a deep breath then steps back and turns away from him.]
SIMON
You were gone for a long time, Elizabeth.
[Simon sighs and walks away, collecting his keys as Weir extinguishes
the candle.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Weir is illuminated as the lights come back on. Perspective switches
to the security camera.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The lights come back on.]
CALDWELL
(into radio)
Engine room, what's our status?
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
MCKAY
(into radio)
All systems are functioning normally. No sign of the virus. Looks
like it worked, Colonel.
HERMIOD
May I suggest we vacate this system? Our current position may well
have been compromised.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(into radio)
Can you give me hyperdrive?
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
That will take longer to get back online.
MCKAY
(into radio)
I can get you sub-light.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Get us out of here, Major.
COOPER
Yes, sir.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[The engines fire up and the ship begins to move off.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[A beeping sound can be heard.]
CALDWELL
What is it?
COOPER
We're veering off course. Navigational controls are not responding.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[McKay is frantically working at the consoles.]
MCKAY
Dammit!
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Engine room, what's happening?
MCKAY
The virus. It's back. Now it's got full control of sub-light
navigation.
SHEPPARD
You said all systems were clean.
MCKAY
They were. When we did the reboot, there was no sign of the virus.
This shouldn't be happening.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
COOPER
Sir, we've got another problem. It's our new heading. We're on a
collision course with the nearest star.
[The view through the window shows a distant star straight ahead.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
The virus returned almost immediately after we re-started the
system.
SHEPPARD
At the risk of repeating myself, I thought you said we wiped it out.
MCKAY
We did. We must have missed something.
WEIR
And it's going to crash us into a sun?
HERMIOD
Not exactly. A more precise calculation of our heading shows that we
will not collide with the star, but rather make a close approach,
near its coronasphere. The ship will survive, but the radiation will
kill everyone on board.
WEIR
Why kill everyone if they already have full navigational control?
MCKAY
The virus has access to our database. It knows our tactics, our
tendencies...
SHEPPARD
They know we'd destroy the ship before we'd allow it to fall into
Wraith hands.
MCKAY
(with a flash of inspiration)
Wait a minute. There was a situation similar to this back at
Stargate Command. I remember reading the report. An alien entity
took control of the base computer, so they did a system shutdown to
destroy it. It survived by loading itself onto a MALP.
WEIR
Okay, we don't have any MALPs.
MCKAY
No, but we've got a bay full of F-302s. We already know the virus
can upload itself onto the ship's navigational computers, but it
could've used any of those ships as a hiding place while we wiped
the Daedalus system clean. It's the only possible explanation.
WEIR
So...
MCKAY
So, we physically pull the memory storage modules from the 302s. We
do another shutdown. That should so the trick.
SHEPPARD
Contact the bridge. Tell Caldwell we're on our way to the bay now.
[Sheppard and McKay leave the room as Weir goes to the console to alert
Caldwell.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and McKay walk through a door and as they walk along the
corridor, perspective is switched between in-scene and the security
camera and back again. As they reach a doorway, the door closes and
McKay tries to open it using the door controls.]
MCKAY
It's not working.
SHEPPARD
Let's try another way.
[They walk off down the corridor to another doorway, which again
closes, and again perspective is switched between in-scene and the
security camera and back again.</blockquote>
MCKAY
(a look of horrified realization on his face)
It's the virus. It must know what we're trying to do.
SHEPPARD
How is that possible?
MCKAY
Well, it's thinking ahead, anticipating our moves, like in a chess
match.
SHEPPARD
I hope you're good at chess.
MCKAY
I don't get to play much. It's tough finding challenging opponents.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Bridge, this is Sheppard.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Are there any open paths to the 302 bay?
[Cooper shakes her head at Caldwell.]
CALDWELL
That's a negative, Colonel. Looks like the entire section's been
sealed off. We tried to override it, but we're not having any luck.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You're going to have to beam us in.
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
MCKAY
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. The transport beam wasn't
designed to beam from one point to another point inside the ship. We
could end up re-materializing half inside a wall.
SHEPPARD
Well, we're just going to have to take that chance.
MCKAY
Right. Of course. Why not?
[They stand straight, then McKay covers his groin with his hands and
crouches half down. Sheppard looks at him quizzically.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Colonel... we're ready.
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Stand by. Hermiod says we need to make a few adjustments first.
[McKay and Sheppard wait.]
CALDWELL
Activating transport beam now.
[They are beamed out of the corridor.]
INT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
[McKay and Sheppard re-materialize.]
MCKAY
(surprised)
It worked.
[As they look down the length of the bay, yellow lights start flashing,
a warning siren sounds and the bay doors begin to open. They turn to
face each other.]
MCKAY
Oh, boy.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
Sir, the bay doors are opening!
CALDWELL
Bridge to engine room! Beam them out now!
INT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
[The lights continue to flash and the siren continues to sound. The
doors at the far end of the bay are completely open to space.]
MCKAY
We should really, really, really be dead right now.
SHEPPARD
I don't feel dead.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
Colonel Sheppard, Dr. McKay, can you hear me?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Yeah, we're reading you.
INT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
HERMIOD
(over radio)
I have raised the fighter bay shield in order to prevent the
atmosphere from escaping. However...
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
...the virus has invaded the system...
INT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
HERMIOD
(over radio)
...and it is only a matter of time before it gains control.
Therefore, I suggest you complete your task as quickly as possible.
[Sheppard and McKay run to the F-302s to begin removing the memory
storage modules.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, how's it coming?
SHEPPARD
We're getting there.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
I can no longer prevent the virus from gaining complete control of
the shield.
WEIR
Well, beam them out!
HERMIOD
Unfortunately, it appears I have lost control of that system as
well.
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
(over radio)
Sir, the shield is down.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
BRIDGE LIEUTENANT
Cargo bay is decompressing.
CALDWELL
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Weir and Hermiod listen.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, do you read me?
INT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
[We pan to find McKay and Sheppard are sitting in the cockpit of an
F-302.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?
SHEPPARD
This is Sheppard. We're okay.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We managed to get in the last F-302 before we lost atmosphere.
[Caldwell sighs with relief.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
Any chance you could beam us out?
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
WEIR
Sorry, John, we lost the transport beam.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
WEIR
(over radio)
You're going to have to sit still for a while.
MCKAY
We pulled all the memory units. Another shutdown should work.
WEIR
(over radio)
Understood.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
COOPER
Sir?
CALDWELL
I see it.
(into radio)
Engine room, this is bridge. We don't have a lot of time before we
approach lethal radiation levels.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
Most of the shutdown protocols are still in place from our first
attempt. This will only take a few minutes.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Let's hope we have a few minutes.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
MCKAY
(having a panic attack)
You know, I've never actually been inside one of these before today.
It's a little, uh, cramped, huh?
SHEPPARD
Just relax, Rodney. We're safe... for the moment.
MCKAY
Right. Quick question, though, just out of curiosity. How much, uh,
like, air do these things carry?
SHEPPARD
Lots.
MCKAY
I'm just saying, because if this doesn't work, and we have to come
up with another plan, who knows how long we could get stuck in here,
and so it... it...
SHEPPARD
You know what, Rodney? You're exactly right. It's a limited supply,
so why don't we conserve it by you not talking?
(raises a finger)
At all.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
All hands, this is Colonel Caldwell. We're going to give this
another shot.
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #1
[Perspective is from the security camera.]
CALDWELL
(over public address system)
We're initiating total system shutdown now.
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #1
[The lights go out.]
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #2
[The lights go out.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The lights go out.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[The lights go out.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[The lights come back on.]
HERMIOD
Re-initializing.
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #1
[Perspective is from the security camera. The lights come back on.]
INT--DAEDALUS ROOM #2
[The lights come back on.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[The lights come back on.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
WEIR
Did it work?
HERMIOD
We will know momentarily.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
This is Sheppard.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
What just happened?
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Stand by.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
We're trying to figure that out.
COOPER
I'm sorry, sir. We had navigational controls for a second, but we
just lost them again.
[The star comes back into view through the window, much closer than
before.]
CALDWELL
It didn't work. We're still on course for the coronasphere.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Hermiod mutters unintelligibly as Weir bows her head.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
This thing is like a damn cockroach. You just can't kill it.
MCKAY
This should have worked. We've disabled every navigational computer
in this bay. There's nowhere else on the ship the virus could hide.
SHEPPARD
You're right. There's nowhere on the ship for it to hide, but we
didn't get every computer.
MCKAY
What are you talking about?
SHEPPARD
We missed one.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[The Daedalus is flying directly towards the star, an F-302 following
behind.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[Sheppard is working at the controls of the ship.]
MCKAY
What are you doing?
SHEPPARD
It's the last F-302, Rodney, the one we left behind. It's tracking
us.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, that makes sense, but we can't go after it. We have no
computer-assisted navigation.
SHEPPARD
I don't need a navigation computer to fly this thing. Besides, we're
not going far.
[Sheppard and McKay strap themselves in.]
SHEPPARD
Engine room, this is Sheppard. Prepare to initiate another shutdown
on my command.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
WEIR
John, what are you doing?
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
Getting rid of the last place the virus can hide.
MCKAY
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I haven't got my belt.
[The ship starts taxiing.]
EXT--DAEDALUS F-302 BAY
[The F-302 exits the bay.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
You'd better make this quick, Sheppard. Radiation levels are
beginning to rise on the outer hull.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Understood.
[As the F-302 flies away from the ship, the other one begins to follow
it.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[A beeping sound can be heard.]
MCKAY
What is that beeping?
SHEPPARD
Somebody just locked on to us. Hold on.
EXT--SPACE
[The two F-302 are flying through space, barrel-rolling and performing
maneuvers.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[The F-302 is flying sideways.]
MCKAY
Whoa. What happened to inertial dampeners?
SHEPPARD
At these speeds, you'll feel the tight turns even with the
dampeners.
MCKAY
Oh, now he tells me.
EXT--SPACE
[The two F-302 are flying through space, barrel-rolling and performing
maneuvers.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[The F-302 is flying sideways.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
I have them on my screens. The computer-controlled ship is preparing
to fire.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
We're just going to tap on the brakes here.
[Sheppard operates a lever and they are both jolted forwards.]
EXT--SPACE
[The other F-302 flies over the top of theirs.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[The monitor shows Sheppard's F-302 behind the other one.]
WEIR
Nice move.
HERMIOD
Indeed.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
He's making a break for the coronasphere.
MCKAY
Any point in mentioning we have even less protection in this ship
than we did in the Daedalus?
SHEPPARD
Not really.
MCKAY
I didn't think so.
EXT--SPACE
[The two F-302s fly towards the star.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
Radiation levels in the Colonel's ship are beginning to rise.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
MCKAY
Is it just me or is it getting a little hotter in here?
SHEPPARD
Hold on. We've almost got 'em.
[The monitor shows Sheppard's attempt to get a lock on the other
F-302.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[The monitor shows the two F-302s but the image fades and is lost.]
WEIR
What happened?
HERMIOD
They're approaching the coronasphere. There is too much
interference.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
MCKAY
See, the thing is, I have very fair skin. I tend to burn very
easily.
SHEPPARD
Just a few more seconds.
[The monitor shows Sheppard's attempt to get a lock on the other F-302.
Interference is causing the image to flicker, but he gets a lock.]
EXT--SPACE
[Sheppard's F-302 fires on the other one. It is a direct hit and the
second F-302 explodes.]
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
WEIR
How long can they survive those radiation levels?
HERMIOD
I believe it has already been too long.
WEIR
(into radio)
John, can you read me?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell is listening with his head bowed.]
WEIR
(over radio)
Oh, please. Rodney, come in.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Daedalus, this is Sheppard.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Target is destroyed. I repeat. Target is destroyed.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
If you try one more shutdown, I think it might just work.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
[McKay is inspecting the skin on his arm.]
WEIR
(over radio)
Well done, both of you. You had us a little worried there for a
minute.
SHEPPARD
Sorry about that.
CALDWELL
(over radio)
This is Caldwell.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
We'll rendezvous as soon as we've eradicated the virus once and for
all.
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
Roger that. Sheppard out.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell sighs.]
INT--F-302 COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
You did great back there, Rodney. Want to take the stick?
MCKAY
Really?
SHEPPARD
No.
EXT--SPACE
[The F-302 flies away from the star and back towards the Daedalus.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Personnel are arriving in the gate room from the Daedalus. McKay,
Beckett, Sheppard and Weir walk up the stairs to the control room,
where they are met by Teyla.]
TEYLA
Dr. Weir, Dr. McKay, Dr. Beckett, welcome back. And Lieutenant
Colonel Sheppard. Congratulations.
SHEPPARD
Thank you. Anything happen while we were gone?
TEYLA
There has been no sign of the Wraith. It would appear that they
continue to believe that Atlantis has been destroyed. But I
understand that your trip was not so happily uneventful.
WEIR
No, not exactly.
MCKAY
My nose is peeling. Do you have moisturizer?
BECKETT
Yes, Rodney.
MCKAY
We should get that.
BECKETT
Yes, Rodney.
[Beckett and McKay leave the control room.]
SHEPPARD
Any word from your off-world contacts?
TEYLA
We have received several intelligence reports, however, as of yet,
there is no news of Lieutenant Ford.
SHEPPARD
I'd like to read those reports, if you don't mind.
TEYLA
I thought you might. I prepared you this copy.
[Teyla hands Sheppard a tablet.]
SHEPPARD
Thank you. Ladies.
[Sheppard leaves the control room.]
TEYLA
(to Weir)
I'm sorry your journey was so difficult.
WEIR
Oh. Well, we got here. That's what counts.
TEYLA
Still, it must have been pleasant to return to Earth. A chance to
reunite with your friends and loved ones.
[Weir looks at her without answering as she enters her office. Zelenka
walks after them from the control room.]
ZELENKA
Dr. Weir...
(excitedly)
Dr. Weir, I'm glad you're back. We have several reports with new
information on the city. Ever since we installed ZPM, we've made
many interesting discoveries.
TEYLA
Can this not wait? Dr. Weir has only just arrived.
ZELENKA
Oh, I'm sorry...
WEIR
No, it's fine. Really.
(taking the tablet from Zelenka)
Let's get back to work.
[As Teyla and Zelenka leave her office, Weir looks out at the gate room
and around her office, then to the tablet. She has a look of
resignation on her face.]
